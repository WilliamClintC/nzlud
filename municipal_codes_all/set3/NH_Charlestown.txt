may be enforced as part of these Town regulations.
VII. LOCAL REQUIREMENTS:
In addition to the State of New Hampshire Code of Administrative Rules Saf-C-1600, the
following shall apply:
A. General; All blasting operations, including the storage and handling of explosives and
blasting agents, shall be performed in accordance with the NFPA 1 Fire Prevention Code,
NFPA 495 Explosive Materials Code, as well as any amended regulations from time to
time. All explosive materials shall be of such character and in such amount as permitted
by the state and local laws, and all respective agencies having jurisdiction over them.
The Fire Chief or his agent reserves the right to visit and inspect any blasting sites to
monitor the operation, and the properly-completed permit application, including
signature by the landowner, shall be deemed to constitute consent to such visits and
inspections. The Chief may confer with other town departments or private blasting
consultants for advice or assistance in the review or monitoring of a blasting site. The
Chief may require a work detail to stand by a site for safety reasons or monitoring
duties. Any costs associated with a work detail or private consultants will be at the
applicant’s expense and will be determined during the application process.
B. Pre-Blast Condition Survey: Prior to conducting any blasting, the applicant or their
agent shall conduct a pre-blast structural condition survey of all existing structures and
conditions on the site, adjacent to the site and within 250 feet of the site. The pre-blast
survey shall document the existing visual conditions of the interior and exterior of the
structure including improvements to the property and other physical factors that could
be reasonably affected by the blasting. Structures such as pipelines, cables,
transmission lines, cisterns, wells and other water systems warrant special attention;
however the assessment of these structures may be limited to surface conditions and
other readily available data. The applicant as well as the owner of the property being
surveyed shall sign all completed surveys. If an owner refuses to allow this survey or
refuses to sign a survey form, the applicant shall provide a waiver form designating
refusal; to be signed by the owner of the property owner. The applicant shall make at
least three (3) attempts to notify the owner of the need for such surveys, the last
attempt shall include a written notification certified, return receipt mail.
a. The pre-blast structural inspection condition survey shall consist of an accurate
description of the interior and exterior condition of each of the structures
examined by means of written notes, sketches, photographic or video narrative.
Descriptions shall locate any existing cracks, damage, or other defects, and shall
include such information so as to make it possible to determine the effect, if
any, of the blast operations on the defect. Where damage is too complicated to
describe in words, photographs shall be taken.
b. The written survey shall be kept by the fire department for five (5) years.
c. The person conducting the survey shall give written notice, not less than 15 days
in advance, to the owner or residents of the property. The notice shall state the
dates on which surveys are to be made. Copies of all notices shall be provided
to the Fire Chief.
d. Upon completion of all blasting work, any and all complaints of damage shall
require a post-blast survey. Notice shall be given to any affected parties so they
may be present during the final examination. Records of the final examination
shall be distributed the same as the original pre-blast survey.
e. All costs associated with condition surveys shall be borne by the applicant.
C. Seismic Measuring Devices: Prior to conducting any blasting, seismic measuring
equipment shall be placed at the closest structures to the blasting site not owned or
controlled by the project owner. Additional monitoring devices may be required to
address vibration concerns or complaints or other causes. If an owner refuses to allow
for or waives the placement of a device at their property, the applicant shall note this on
the form.

comply with the ISEE “Performance Specifications for Blasting Seismographs”.
When used, blasting seismographs shall be deployed in the field according to the ISEE
“Field Practice Guidelines for Blasting Seismographs”.
The town reserves the right to require geological surveys of the area should conditions
warrant; such analysis, particularly with regards to blasting in proximity to public water
supplies or sensitive groundwater areas. The applicant shall provide a vicinity map or
plan, locating the blast site, and the location of all measuring devices. All costs
associated with the analysis and monitoring shall be borne by the applicant.

within twenty-four (24) hours in writing the following items:
a. Details of the round as shot.
b. Results of the blast monitoring at each instrument location, including PPV in
millimeters per second (inches per second), as well as a copy of the strip chart
recording for each monitoring location, marked with the date, time, location
and signature of the seismograph operator.
c. If the seismic ground vibration or air concussions surpass the USBM RI 8507
established limits as illustrated in C above, the operations shall cease and the
permit is revoked, pending a report explaining the exceedance and a new
blasting plan being developed to mitigate the exceedance.
F. Warning Signals: Adequate warnings shall be given to all personnel in the proximity to
the blast site at least five (5) minutes in advance of each blast using a predetermined
series of audible horn blasts for the immediate blast area. The applicant shall notify the
Charlestown Fire Department and Charlestown Police Department and the Charlestown
Selectmen’s office not less than twenty-four (24) hours before the scheduled time of
blast or explosion by phone and email.
When requested by the residents adjacent to the blasting, a call list will be established
to notify those residents of the time of the blast one (1) hour prior to the blast. This
may be accomplished by telephone or e-mail.
G. Fly Rock Control: Blasting mats or other sufficient protective cover (earth) shall be used
when determined necessary by the applicant’s blaster-in-charge to prevent the rock
and/or debris from being thrown beyond the blast area.
H. Responsibility of Blasting Operations: Review of the applicants blasting submittals by
the Town of Charlestown, or any department therein, will not relieve the applicant or
the property owner of their responsibility for the accuracy, adequacy, and safety of the
blast; for exercising proper supervision and field judgement; for preventing damage to
structures; and for producing results in accordance with the State of New Hampshire
regulations. The applicant and the property owner shall take whatever measures it
deems necessary, in addition to the requirements herein, to protect the safety of
persons and property, both at the site and away from the site. The applicant and the
property owner shall have full and complete responsibility for the handling, discharging,
or setting of any and all damage or annoyance claims resulting from the blasting
activities. Any monitoring and/or review of the applicant’s procedures and performance
shall not relieve the applicant or the property owner of their responsibility for the safety
at and away from the site, or for preventing damage to adjacent structures or property.
I. Prohibitions:
a. No blasting shall be conducted without a valid permit.
b. No blasting shall be conducted after an order to cease blasting has been issued
by the permitting authority and communicated to the permit holder.
c. The overnight storage of explosives or blasting agents, whether supervised or
not, is not allowed. Loaded explosives shall have twenty-four (24) hour
supervision and be guarded overnight when conditions or circumstances
delayed the blast and the Fire Chief or his agent has approved the overnight
delay in blasting.
d. No drilling shall take place within fifty (50’) feet of any loaded hole.
J. Enforcement: The Fire Chief or appointed agent has the authority to enforce the above
regulations against both the applicant (blasting company) and the property owner
including revocation of the permit, the issuance of penalties and/or injunctive relief.
K. Revocation of Permit: A permit issued hereunder may be revoked by the fire chief or
Board of Selectmen or appointed agent for just cause including but not limited to:
failure to conduct operations in accordance with the standards herein resulting in
property damage that does or has the potential to exceed the amount of liability
insurance held by the applicant; lapse or revocation of the state license, or the
institution of proceedings (civil, criminal, or administrative) by the state for violation of
applicable state law or regulations. This permit may be restored upon showing the
condition leading to the revocation has been corrected.
L. Appeal: Any permit denial, revocation or suspension may be appealed, within ten (10)
working days and not thereafter to the Board of Selectmen. Any such appeal shall be in
writing and shall clearly specify the facts and circumstances warranting issue or
reinstatement of the permit. The Board of Selectmen shall order such issuance of
reinstatement only on the appellant’s showing that the denial, revocation or suspension
complained of was erroneous. The Board of Selectmen may also order that appropriate
conditions be attached to any permit that it finds should be issued or reinstated.
M. Penalty: Any person found to have violated these regulations shall be guilty of a
violation and shall be punished by a maximum fine as proved by applicable state law,
which is currently one thousand dollars ($1,000). Each violations and/or each day of
violation shall be regarded as a separate offence.

a. The Board of Selectmen, following a hearing for which notice has been given to
abutters and the public in the manner set forth in RSA 155-E:7, may for good
cause grant a written variance to any of the specific minimum standards
contained in these regulations, if they make written findings: (1) that due to
special conditions of the particular property, strict enforcement would be
unreasonable, (2) that in the particular circumstances, public health, safety,
peace and quiet will be adequately protected, and (3) that the variance meets
the spirit of these regulations. The Selectmen may condition such a variance on
reasonable alternative conditions or standards.

SECTION 11
TOWN OF CHARLESTOWN, NEW HAMPSHIRE
PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE FACILITIES ORDINANCE
1. PURPOSE AND AUTHORITY
It is the express purpose of this Ordinance to permit carriers to locate personal
wireless service facilities within the Town of Charlestown consistent with
appropriate land use regulations that will ensure compatibility with the visual and
environmental features of the Town. This Ordinance enables review of the
location and siting of personal wireless service facilities by the Town of
Charlestown so as to eliminate or mitigate the visual and environmental impacts
of personal wireless service facilities. This Ordinance is structured to encourage
carriers to locate on existing buildings and structures whenever possible. New
ground mounted personal wireless facilities are permitted, but only when the use
of existing structures and buildings is found to be infeasible. Co-location is
encouraged for all personal wireless service facility applications and the review of
a personal wireless facility shall be on the basis of the site being built using all
positions on the mount.
This ordinance is adopted for the above stated purposes pursuant to the authority
granted in RSA 674:16-21 and 674:43.
2. APPLICABILITY
No person shall, within the Town of Charlestown, build, erect, or install a
personal wireless service facility, or a structure intended for use in conjunction
with such a facility, without a building permit and Site Plan approval by the
Planning Board, as detailed in Section 5 of this Ordinance. All provisions of the
Site Plan Review Regulations shall apply, except where plainly inconsistent with
this Ordinance. The Planning Board’s decisions shall be within the time frame set
forth in RSA 676:4, I(c), and shall be in writing with reasons as set forth in RSA
676:3. This Ordinance shall apply to personal wireless service facilities proposed
to be located on property owned by the Town of Charlestown, on privately owned
property, and on property that is owned by any other governmental entity that acts
to lease such property to a carrier. In the case of a facility to be located on
property of the Town of Charlestown, no lease or other agreement shall be
deemed final until the terms of this Ordinance have been met.

7.7 Fall Zone for Non-Ground Mounts: In the event that an existing structure is
proposed as a mount for a personal wireless service facility, a fall zone shall not
be required, but the setback provisions of the zoning district shall apply. In the
case of pre-existing nonconforming structures, personal wireless service facilities
and their equipment shelters shall not increase any non-conformities.
8. PERFORMANCE AND DESIGN STANDARDS
8.1 Visibility All personal wireless service facilities shall be designed and installed
in such a manner that in the judgment of the Planning Board there shall be no
unreasonable adverse visual impact on the area where the facility is located, and
any adverse visual impact shall be adequately mitigated. In applying this
standard, the board shall utilize the following standards:
A. Visual impacts shall be determined on the basis of:
1. Change in community scale, as exhibited in relative height,
mass or proportion of the personal wireless service facility
within its proposed surroundings.
2. New visible elements proposed on a contrasting
background.
3. Different colors and textures proposed against a contrasting
background.
4. Use of materials that are foreign to the existing built
environment.
B. Visual mitigation shall be determined on the basis of:
1. Conservation of opportunities to maintain community scale,
e.g. buffering areas and low-lying buildings should not be
compromised so as to start a trend away from the existing
community scale.
2. Amount and type of landscaping and /or natural vegetation.
3. Preservation of view corridors, vistas, and view sheds.
4. Continuation of existing colors, textures, and materials.
8.2 Camouflage
A. Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures –
Roof Mounts: When a personal wireless service facility extends
above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, every
effort shall be made to conceal or camouflage the facility within or
behind existing or new architectural features to limit its visibility
from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped
back from the front façade in order to limit their impact on the
building’s silhouette.
B. Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures –
Side Mounts: Personal wireless service facilities which are side
mounted shall blend with the existing building’s architecture and
the panels shall be painted or shielded with material consistent

personal wireless service facilities shall be surrounded by an
existing, fully-grown buffer of dense tree growth that extends
continuously for a minimum distance of one hundred and fifty
(150) feet from the mount, security barrier, or designated clear area
for access to equipment, whichever is greatest, and screens views
of the facility in all directions, as set forth in Figure 2, with the
structure extending no more than twenty (20) feet above the
canopy, as set forth in Section 6.2. These trees must be existing on
the subject property, planted on site, or be within a landscape
easement on an adjoining site. The Planning Board shall have the
authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on
on-site conditions. The one hundred and fifty (150) foot vegetative
buffer area shall be protected by a landscape easement or be within
the area of the carrier’s lease. The easement or lease shall specify
that the trees within the buffer shall not be removed or topped,
unless the trees are dead or dying and present a hazard to persons
or property.
See Figure 2
8.3 Color – To the extent that any personal wireless service facilities extend above the
height of the vegetation immediately surrounding it they shall be of a color, which
blends with the background or surroundings.

within open areas that are clearly visible from public roads, recreational areas, or
abutting properties. A buffer of dense tree growth as per Section 7.2(C) shall
surround all ground-mounted personal wireless service facilities.
8.8 Driveways – If available, existing entrances and driveways to serve a personal
wireless service facility shall be utilized, unless the applicant can demonstrate that
a new entrance and driveway will result in less visual, traffic, and environmental
impact. New driveways to serve a personal wireless service facility shall not
exceed twelve (12) feet in width. A gravel or crushed stone surface is encouraged.
The construction and/or reconstruction of any new driveways shall conform to the
Erosion Control and Sedimentation provisions of the Site Plan Review
Regulations.
8.9 Antenna Types – Any antenna array placed upon an existing or proposed groundmount,
utility pole, or transmission line mount shall have a diameter of no more

service facility in good condition. Such maintenance shall include, but shall not
be limited to, painting, structural integrity of the mount and security barrier, and
maintenance of the buffer areas, fencing and landscaping.
9.2 Monitoring – As part of the issuance of the site plan approval or building permit,
the property owner shall agree that the Town of Charlestown may enter the subject
property to obtain RFR measurements and noise measurements at the expense of
the carrier. The Town shall provide reasonable written notice to the carrier and
landowner and provide them the opportunity to accompany the Town
representatives when the measurements are conducted.
9.3 Security for Removal – Recognizing the hazardous situation presented by
abandoned and unmonitored telecommunications facilities, the Planning Board
shall set the form and amount of security that represents the cost for removal and
disposal of abandoned telecommunications facilities in the event that a facility is
abandoned and the facility owner is unwilling or unable to remove the facility in
accordance with Section 9.2. The amount of the security shall be based upon the
actual removal cost plus fifteen percent (15%), based on information provided by
the applicant and certified by a professional civil or structural engineer licensed in
New Hampshire, every five (5) years from the date of the Planning Board’s
approval of the site plan. If the cost has increased more than fifteen percent
(15%), the owner of the facility shall provide additional security in the amount of
the increase.
9.4 Subleases and Transfers Of Ownership. Any new lease, sublease, or transfer of
ownership of any facility permitted under this Ordinance shall be reported to the
Town of Charlestown, and adequate provision made for the continuation of
security under this section. Violation of this section shall be grounds for
revocation of site plan approval.

FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT ORDINANCE
6.1 AUTHORITY
This ordinance, adopted pursuant to the authority of RSA 674:16, shall be known as the
Town of Charlestown Floodplain Development Ordinance. The regulations in this
ordinance shall overlay and supplement the regulations in the Town of Charlestown
Zoning Ordinance, and shall be considered part of the Zoning Ordinance for purposes
of administration and appeals under state law. If any provision of this ordinance differs
or appears to conflict with any provisions of the Zoning Ordinance or other ordinance or
regulation, the provision imposing the greater restriction or more stringent standard shall
be controlling.
The following regulations in this ordinance shall apply to all lands designated as special
flood hazard areas by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in its
“Flood Insurance Study for the County of Sullivan, NH”, dated May 23, 2006 or as
amended together with the associated Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated May 23, 2006
or as amended, which are declared to be a part of this ordinance and are hereby
incorporated by reference.
6.2 DEFINITION OF TERMS
The following definitions shall apply only to this Floodplain Development Ordinance, and
shall not be affected by the provisions of any other ordinance of the Town of
Charlestown.
“Area of Shallow Flooding” means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on the Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or greater annual possibility of flooding
to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist,
where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident.
Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet-flow.
“Area of Special Flood Hazard” is the land in the floodplain within the Town of
Charlestown, subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year.
The area is designated as Zone A, AE, and AO on the Flood Insurance Rate Map.
“Base Flood” means the flood having a one-percent possibility of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
“Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade on all sides.
“Building” see structure.
2
“Development” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate,
including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling,
grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials.
“FEMA” means the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
“Flood or Flooding” means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation or normally dry land areas from (1) the overflow or inland or tidal waters, and
(2) the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
“Flood Elevation Study” means an examination evaluation and determination of flood
hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an examination
and determination of mudslide or flood-related erosion hazards.
“Flood Insurance Rate Map” (FIRM) means an official map incorporated with this
ordinance on which FEMA has delineated both the special flood hazard areas and the
risk premium zones applicable to the Town of Charlestown.
“Flood Insurance Study” – see “Flood Elevation Study”.
“Floodplain” or “Flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being
inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding).
“Flood Proofing” means any combination of structural and non-structural additions,
changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real
estate or improved real property, water and sanitation facilities, structures and their
contents.
“Floodway” – see “Regulatory Floodway”.
“Functionally Dependent Use” means a use which cannot perform its intended
purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes
only docking and port facilities that are necessary for the loading/unloading of cargo or
passengers, and ship building/repair facilities but does not include long-term storage or
related manufacturing facilities.
“Highest Adjacent Grade” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface
prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure.
“Historic Structure” means any structure that is:
(a) Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained
by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National
Register;
3
(b) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a
district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered
historic district;

preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the
Interior; or
(d) Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with
historic preservation programs that have been certified either;
1) By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the
Interior, or
2) Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved
programs.
“Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not
considered a building’s lowest floor, provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to
render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of
this ordinance.
“Manufactured Home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. For flood plain
management purposes the term “manufactured home” includes park trailers, travel
trailers, and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than 180 days. This
includes manufactured homes located in a manufactured home park or subdivision.
“Manufactured home park or subdivision” means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of
land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale.
“Mean Sea Level” means the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or
other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance
Rate Map are referenced.
“New construction” means, for the purposes of determining insurance rates,
structures for which the “start of construction” commenced on or after the effective date
of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes,
new construction means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or
after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community
and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures.
4
“100-Year Flood” – see “Base Flood”.
“Recreational Vehicle” is defined as:
A. built on a single chassis;
B. 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
C. designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck;
and
D. designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary
living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use.
“Regulatory Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without
cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height.
“Special Flood Hazard Area” see “area of special flood hazard”.
“Structure” means for floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building,
including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a
manufactured home.
“Start of Construction” includes substantial improvements, and means the date the
building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit
date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the
construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement
of manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of
streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers,
or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on
the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling
units or part of the main structure.
“Substantial Damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby
the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or
exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
“Substantial Improvement” means any combination of repairs, reconstruction,
alteration or improvements to a structure in which the cumulative cost equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure. The market value of the
structure should equal;
(1) the appraised value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvements, or
(2) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage
occurring.
5
For the purposes of this definition, “Substantial Improvement” is considered to occur
when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage,
regardless of actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any
project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary,
or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions
or any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure”.
“Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant
with the community’s flood plain management regulations. A structure or other
development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of
compliance required in 44CFR § 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5)
is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
“Water Surface Elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), of floods of various
magnitudes and frequencies in the flood plains.
6.3 APPLICATION PROCEDURES
6.3.1-Permits – All proposed development in any special flood hazard areas shall
require a permit.
6.3.2-Review Process – The building inspector shall review all building permit
applications for new construction or substantial improvements to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonable safe from flooding. If a proposed building site
is located in a special flood hazard area, all new construction or substantial
improvements shall:
(i) be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic
and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy;
(ii) be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
(iii) be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages;
and
(iv) be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air
conditioning equipment, and other service facilities that are designed
and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
6
6.3.3 On-site Waste Disposal - Where new or replacement water and sewer systems
(including on-site systems) are proposed in a special flood hazard area, the applicant
shall provide the Building Inspector with certification, by a New Hampshire licensed
engineer, that these systems and discharges from the system into flood waters, and onsite
waste disposal systems will be located outside of the flood hazard area or will be
elevated so as to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during periods
of flooding.
6.3.4 – Required Information – For all new or substantially improved structures located
in Zones A, AO, or AE the applicant shall furnish the following information to the
Building Inspector on a plan bearing the seal of an engineer or surveyor licensed with
the State of New Hampshire.
(a) the as-built elevation (in relation to NGVD) of the lowest floor (including
basement) and include whether or not such structures contain a basement.
(b) if the structure has been flood-proofed, the as-built elevation (in relation to
NGVD) to which the structure was flood-proved.
(c) Any certification of flood-proofing.
The Building Inspector shall maintain for public inspection, and shall furnish such
information upon request.
6.3.5 – Other Permits – The Building Inspector shall not grant a building permit until the
applicant certifies that all necessary permits have been received from those
governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law,
including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendment of 1972,
33 U.S.C. 1334.
6.3.6 – Alteration / Relocation of Watercourses – In riverine situations, prior to the
alteration or relocation of a watercourse the applicant for such authorization shall notify
the Wetlands Board of the New Hampshire Environmental Services Department and
submit copies of such notification to the Building Inspector. Further, the applicant shall
be required to submit copies of said notification to those adjacent communities as
determined by the Building Inspector.
The applicant shall submit to the Building Inspector certification provided by a registered
professional engineer, assuring that the flood carrying capacity of an altered or
relocated watercourse can and will be maintained.
Along watercourses that have a designated Regulatory Floodway no encroachments,
including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development are
allowed within the floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and
hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that
7
the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the
community during the base flood discharge.
Until a Regulatory Floodway is designated along watercourses, no new construction,
substantial improvements or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
Zone AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
one foot at any point within the community.
The Building Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway data
available from Federal, State, or other sources as criteria for requiring that all
development located in Zone A meet the following floodway requirement:
"No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and
other development are allowed within the floodway that would result in any increase
in flood levels within the community during the base flood discharge."
6.4 SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA REQUIREMENTS
In special flood hazard areas the Building Inspector shall determine the 100 year flood
elevation in the following order of precedence according to the data available.
a. In Zones AE, refer to the elevation data provided in the community’s Flood
Insurance Study and accompanying FIRM.
b. In zone A the Building Inspector shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
100 year flood elevation data available from any federal, state or other source,
including data submitted for development proposals submitted to the community
(i.e. subdivisions, site approvals).
c. In Zone AO the flood elevation is determined by adding the elevation of the
highest adjacent grade to the depth number specified on the FIRM, or if no depth
number is specified on the FIRM at least 2 feet.
The Building Inspector’s 100 year flood elevation determination will be used as criteria
for requiring in Zones A, AO and AE that:
a. All new construction or substantial improvement of residential structures have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the 100 year flood
elevation;
b. That all new construction or substantial improvements of non-residential
structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the
100 year flood level, or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
8
(i) be flood-proofed so that below the 100 year flood elevation the
structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the
passage of water;
(ii) have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy; and
(iii) be certified by a licensed professional engineer or architect that the
design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section.
c. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within special
flood hazard areas shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the
lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood level, and be
securely anchored to resist floatation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces;
d. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A and AE shall either:
(i) be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
(ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
(iii) meet all standards of section 60.3 (b) (1) of the National Flood
Insurance Program Regulations and the elevation and anchoring
requirements for “manufactured homes” in Paragraph (c) (6) of Section
60.3.
e. For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas
below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are permitted, providing they
meet the following requirements: (1) The enclosed area is unfinished or flood
resistant, useable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage; (2)
the area is not a basement; (3) shall be designated to automatically equalize
hydrostatic flood forces on external walls by allowing for the entry and exit of
flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a
registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the
following minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to
flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than
one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, or
other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit
of floodwater.
9
f. Proposed structures to be located on slopes in special flood hazard areas, Zones
AH and AO, shall include adequate drainage paths to guide flood waters around
and away from the proposed structures.
6.5 VARIANCES AND APPEALS
Any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building Inspector made under
this ordinance may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment, as set forth in RSA
676:5.
If the applicant, upon appeal, requests a variance as authorized by RSA 674:33 1(b),
the applicant shall have the burden of showing in addition to the usual variance
standards under state law:
(a) that the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, or extraordinary public expense;
(b) that if the requested variance is for activity within a designated regulatory
floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result;
(c) that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.
The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall notify the applicant in writing that: (i) the
issuance of a variance to construct below the base flood level will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of
insurance coverage and (ii) such construction below the base flood level increases risks
to life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions.

the application of these Regulations.
SECTION 5.2 PURPOSE
The purpose of Site Plan Review is to provide for the safe and attractive development or
change or expansion of use of the site and to protect the health, safety and prosperity of
the community, through a review and analysis of the location, design and function of
existing and proposed constructions and topographical and landscaping features of the
site, and of the interaction of such constructions and features with neighboring lots, Town
highways and sidewalks and with the community as a whole. The Site Plan Review is
intended to assure compliance with all of the provisions of RSA 674:44 Site Plan
Regulations, Section II, and more particularly to:
A. ensure that there is sufficient capacity on the part of schools, emergency
services, water supply and distribution systems, sewage and solid waste
disposal systems, drainage, roads, and other community services to support
the proposed project;
B. provide for adequate snow storage and removal;
C. provide adequate fire protection, including access for emergency vehicles
and water supply for fire suppression;
D. ensure access for the handicapped to parking areas and buildings;
E. provide safe pedestrian and bicycle access;
F. correct illegal, hazardous, unsightly, or nuisance conditions;
G. protect the natural landscape as much as possible by minimizing tree and
soil removal;
H. protect the economic and aesthetic interests of properties adjacent to a
proposed development and of the community to assure that a development
shall not be detrimental to the values of land or property in the
surrounding neighborhood or have a negative impact upon the Townis
property;
I. provide aesthetically pleasing and compatible design of buildings and
facilities; and
J. ensure that projects are completed in a timely manner.

5.5.2 Review by the Planning Board for Completed Application
A. A completed application shall address or consist of the documents and
information required by Section 5.6, Application Requirements.
B. An application for site plan review shall be filed with the planning office at
least twenty-one (21) days prior to the regularly scheduled Board Meeting on
forms designated by the planning office. The applicant shall pay, in advance,
all costs of notice to abutters. Failure to pay costs may be the basis for
disapproval of the application. RSA 676:4,I(e)(2).
C. The Planning Administrator shall review the application for completeness.
Only complete plans, as recommended by the Planning Administrator, will be
scheduled for hearing at a public meeting. At that hearing the Board shall
rule on the completeness of the application. Only after the Board determines
that the application is complete will the legal time limits be in effect. If the
application is deemed to be complete by the Planning Board, final review can
commence at the same meeting. A formal hearing on completeness or final
review may be adjourned to continue on a specific date with no further notice
of the meeting required.
D. The applicant may appeal the administrative determination of
incompleteness to the Board and it shall be a condition of appeal that the
applicant shall pay all required fees. If the Board disagrees with the
administrative determination of incompleteness, the application will be placed
on the agenda for hearing at the next regular meeting.
E. If the Board rules that the application is incomplete, a notice of
6
incompleteness will be sent to the applicant (see Section 5.5.6).
5.5.3 Notice of Application to Abutters and Applicant

Planning Board, and by posting in two public locations at least ten days prior
to the public hearing meeting. The Board may also give notice by regular
mail to other landowners in the vicinity of the tract.
5.5.4 Fees and Consultants
All costs of such notice shall be paid in advance by the applicant. Failure to pay such costs
shall constitute valid grounds for the Board to terminate further consideration and to
disapprove the site plan without a public hearing. Additional fees may be imposed by the
Board during the review process to ascertain compliance, to cover fees and disbursement
of consultants to the Board, including, but not limited to, engineers, surveyors, lawyers and
Planning Administrator.
In the event that it is necessary for the Town to take legal action against an applicant to
collect unpaid fees, the Town shall be entitled to an award of reasonable attorney's fees
incurred in collection of the unpaid amount.

Section 5.5.6. Additional notice of an adjourned session of a public hearing is not required
if the date, time and place of the adjourned session is made known at the prior hearing. At
the hearing, the applicant, any abutter or any person with a demonstrable interest in the
matter may testify in person or in writing. Other persons may testify as permitted by the
Board at each hearing. Additional public hearings may be held at the discretion of the
Board.
7
5.5.6 Time Limits
Within thirty days of the delivery of an application, or at the next regular meeting for which
notice can be given in accordance with the requirements of RSA 676:4 I(b), the Planning
Board must determine if a submitted application is complete according to the Board's
regulations and vote on its acceptance. If the Board determines that a submitted
application is incomplete according to the Board's regulations, the Board must notify the
applicant in accordance with RSA 676:3 and describe the information, procedure, or other
requirements necessary for the application to be complete.
When the Board determines that the application is complete according to the Boardis
regulations, the Board shall begin formal consideration and shall act to approve,
conditionally approve as provided in RSA 676:4, I(c)(1), or disapprove within sixty-five days
of that determination. The Board may seek an extension or waiver as provided in RSA
676:4, I(f). The applicant may waive the requirement for Planning Board action within the
time period specified in RSA 676:4, I(c) and consent to an extension which is mutually
agreeable. Upon failure of the Board to approve or disapprove the application within the
foregoing time periods, the applicant may obtain from the Board of Selectmen an order
directing the Board to act within thirty (30) days.
If the Planning Board fails to act upon the order of the selectmen within that thirty day time
period, then within forty days of the issuance of the order the selectmen must certify on
the applicant's plat that it is approved pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(c)(1), unless during those
forty days the selectmen have identified in writing some land use regulation with which the
application does not comply. Failure of the selectmen to issue an order to the Planning
Board or to certify approval of the plat upon the planning Board's failure to comply with the
order constitutes grounds for the applicant to petition the Superior Court for an order
approving the application, if the Court determines that the proposal complies with existing
site plan review and subdivision regulations, zoning, and other ordinances. If the Court
determines that the failure to act within the time specified was the fault of the Board and
was not justified, the Court may order the Board to pay the applicant's reasonable costs,
including attorney fees, incurred in securing the order.
5.5.7 Notice of Action
A. Notice of Action - The Board shall notify the applicant, in writing, by means of
a Notice of Action as defined in Section 5.4.6, sent by certified mail, of its
action on the final site plan. In case of disapproval, the Board shall clearly
set forth in the Notice to the applicant the reasons for its action, with specific
reference to standards contained in these Regulations. A copy shall be
available at the Selectmen's Office for public inspection within 72 hours after
the decision is made.

applicant presents to the Building Inspector a Notice of Action, from the
Planning Board, granting approval of a site plan, which shall have been
signed by the applicant, and no occupancy shall be permitted unless the
applicant shall have complied with the approved site plan. Any physical
changes to a current non-residential structure or site will require new site
plan approval.
4. Expiration - Any site plan for which a Building Permit has not been obtained
within one year of the date of approval of the Site Plan shall be considered
void unless the Board, upon written request from the applicant, grants an
extension for good cause.
E. Conditional Approval
1. Approval with Conditions Precedent: In conformance with RSA 676:4
I, (d), the Planning Board may impose conditions on a site plan that
will require an additional noticed public hearing in which abutters have
a chance to review and comment on compliance with such conditions
precedent. If the Board has imposed such conditions, then approval
is conditional. Site plans shall not be granted final approval and
signed by the Board until all such conditions have been met.
2. Final Approval with Conditions: The Board may grant final approval of
a Site Plan with conditions that are supplementary to any conditions
indicated in the application as described in Section 5.6 or in the
approved Site Plan. Such conditions shall be described in the Notice
of Action and are subject to enforcement procedures of the Town.
Some conditions may be satisfied by bonding or other security as
described in Section 5.9.2.
5.5.8 Procedure When Approvals from the ZBA are Required
When approval for a Special Exception or Variance from the ZBA is required by the Zoning
Ordinance, the applicant shall first obtain such approval before applying for Site Plan
approval. Any applications submitted without the necessary zoning approvals shall be
deemed incomplete. Any conditions imposed by the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall not
be diminished by the requirements contained in these Regulations. The condition which
imposes the greater restriction or higher standard shall apply.
5.5.9 Procedure When Subdivision Approval is Required
When both subdivision and site plan approval are required on a proposed development,
9
the Board may hold the Site Plan Review hearing at the same time as the hearing required
for the final plat by the Subdivision Regulations. The Site Plan application shall not be
considered complete until preliminary approvals have been obtained for minor or major
subdivision.
5.5.10 Phased Development
The approval procedure for Phased Development shall be as follows:
A. The entire site shall be approved under these Regulations.
2. The improvements required to be installed by the Planning Board as set forth
in the Notice of Action shall be constructed and installed for each phase. The
plan for phasing shall be submitted to the Board and approved as part of the
Notice of Action on the Site Plan approval.
C. In the event of any change after Phase I in the approved Site Plan, the
applicant shall notify the Board in writing of such change. The Board shall
determine whether or not the proposed change is a minor change or a major
change. If the Board determines that the change is a minor change, then the
Board may review the proposed change at a public meeting without further
Notice, or, in the alternative, require a public hearing with notice. All major
changes shall require Notice and public hearing. In the event of approval of
any change, the applicant shall be required to submit a revised Site Plan to
the Board.

Proposals for signs to be erected in connection with the Site Plan shall be reviewed in
conjunction with an application for Site Plan review in accordance with the applicable
regulations of Section 8.6 of the Town of Charlestown Zoning Ordinance.
SECTION 5.7 PERFORMANCE, DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION
REQUIREMENTS
The Planning Board shall approve the proposed site plan only upon determination that the
following standards have been met or the Planning Board has, upon receipt of a written
request, waived certain requirements.
5.7.1 General Requirements
The site shall be of such character that it can be used safely for the construction and
17
installation of the improvements proposed by the applicant, without excessive grades,
inadequate drainage and/or other hazardous conditions.
The proposed use, building design and layout shall meet the provisions of the Zoning
Ordinance, the Subdivision Regulations and other regulations and ordinances of the Town,
shall be consistent with the goals, policies and recommendations of the Master Plan, and
shall be determined by the Planning Board to be of such a size and character that it will be
appropriate to the existing settlement of the surrounding area. Each site shall be shielded
and buffered as needed to provide for the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing
development of the site to the neighboring properties.
The proposed location and height of buildings or structures, walls and fences, parking,
loading, landscaping and snow removal shall be such that it will not interfere with existing
use of, discourage the appropriate development of, or unreasonably affect the value of,
land adjacent to the proposed site or of the community as a whole.
The development shall conform, to the extent possible, to the natural topography of the
site. Site clearing shall be kept to the minimum required for the construction of buildings
and improvements, taking into consideration the need for pedestrian and vehicular safety
and the need for light and air. Natural cover shall be retained, to supplement landscaping,
to the extent possible and reasonable.
No building of roads or structures, laying of utilities or other site work shall commence until
an application has received final approval of the Planning Board.
5.7.2 Erosion Control and Sedimentation
All construction, regardless of the area of bare earth exposed, shall comply with the
following:
2. Graded areas shall be vegetated to insure erosion control by seeding,
mulching, and fertilizing. Disturbed areas shall be planted with suitable plant
material.
3. Grading shall not exceed a ratio of 3 horizontal to 1 vertical without special
erosion control measures. Where needed, netting shall be provided on
slopes while ground cover is being established.
4. Stripping of vegetation, regrading or other development shall be done in a
way that will minimize soil erosion.
5. Wherever practical, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and
supplemented.
18
6. The disturbed area shall be kept to a minimum.
7. Where necessary, temporary vegetation and/or mulching shall be used to
protect areas exposed during development.
8. Disturbed areas shall be planted with suitable plant materials.
9. Sediment basins (debris basins, de-silting basins or silt traps) shall be
installed and maintained where necessary to remove from runoff waters any
sediment from land undergoing development.
10. The angle of graded slopes and fills shall be no greater than the angle which
can be retained by vegetative cover or alternative proposed erosion control
devices or structures. In any event, slopes left exposed must immediately be
planted or otherwise provided with permanent ground cover or other means
sufficient to retain erosion.
11. A ground cover sufficient to retain erosion must be planted or otherwise
provided within 30 working days, season permitting, on any portion of the
tract upon which further active construction is not being undertaken.
12. The development plan or land disturbing activity shall be fitted to the
topography and soils so as to create the least erosion potential.
13. Any area of bare earth exposed in conjunction with building development
must be permanently stabilized through replanting, paving or other approved
means of eliminating wind or water erosion. Such stabilization must be
completed prior to building occupancy or a performance bond must be
posted in an amount sufficient to assure completion of such work.
5.7.3 Landscaping
Landscaping should be provided which is in keeping with the character of the area where
the site is located, the purpose of the development and the location of buildings and
improvements. Applicants are encouraged to arrange a conceptual review in accordance
with Section 5.6 A. The applicant may propose, and the Board may accept, a phased plan
of implementation of landscaping requirements to mitigate the financial impact for the
applicant, as provided in Section 5.5.10.
A. Objectives - The objectives of these landscaping requirements are:
1. to enhance the overall visual attractiveness of the building, the site,
and the Town;
19
2. to protect and preserve the appearance, character, and value of
surrounding neighborhoods by providing a harmonious transition from
one type of land use to another; by improving the compatibility
between various land uses in the Town; and, by buffering neighboring
properties and areas from any adverse effects of site development;
3. to mitigate the appearance and aesthetic impact of accessory uses
such as loading areas, dumpsters, utility equipment and areas,
storage areas, and parking areas with appropriate screening and
landscaping as warranted;
4. to facilitate safe movement of pedestrian and vehicular traffic over a
site and to protect pedestrian movement in areas with vehicular traffic;
5. to mitigate increased climatic temperature caused by large expanses
of unshaded asphalt;
6. to reduce erosion and to protect wetlands and aquifer recharge areas;
7. to promote energy efficiency and conservation through landscaping
and site design; and,
8. to soften glare, filter noise and air pollution, create privacy, and to
provide an attractive boundary between properties.
B. Definitions - For the purposes of this section the following definitions shall
apply:
Buffer: a landscaped area running generally parallel to the boundaries of a
parcel and intended to lessen the negative impact of a land use on
neighboring parcels or nearby areas.
Screen: landscaping or fencing or both designed to conceal from view all or
part of a structure or site which, in the judgment of the Planning Board, is
unattractive or otherwise warrants mitigation of the effect of its appearance.
Opaque: excludes all visual contact between uses and creates a strong
impression of spatial separation.
Semi-opaque: partially blocks visual contact between uses and creates a
strong impression of the separation of spaces.
Tree, shade: a deciduous or evergreen tree which can attain a height of
more than 30 feet and whose branches and foliage create a ceiling or upper
limit for the other foliage on site.
20
Tree, understory: a small tree, that does not normally attain a height greater
than 30 feet, being single or multi-stemmed.
Shrub: a low, woody plant with several permanent stems instead of a single
trunk.
Ground-cover: a tightly interlaced protective layer of low, dense-growing
plants over the Earth's soil.
C. Minimum Landscaped Area
1. On all parcels subject to these guidelines, a minimum buffer or
landscaped area along the front, side, and rear property lines should
be provided totaling 25% of the lot area or 15 feet in width for the
length of each property line, whichever is greater.
2. The minimum landscaped area shall be planted with intermittent
vegetation from the ground level to at least 30 feet in height and
should be planted at a minimum rate of one (1) shade tree and two
(2) shrubs for each 1,000 square feet unless the Planning Board
determines that a semi-opaque or an opaque buffer is required.
3. Where healthy plant material exists on the site, prior to development,
and provision is made to preserve that plant material on a permanent
basis, credit may be given for such preserved natural plant material
toward these landscaping requirements.
4. Within the landscaped areas the applicant should propose a mix of
shade trees, understory trees, shrubs, well-kept grassed areas and
ground cover which is appropriate for the site, its environment, and its
surroundings. All new plant material shall be hardy stock, suitable to
this area.
5. At the time of planting, all deciduous trees should be a minimum 1.5
to 2 inches in caliper, measured 6 inches above the finish grade level;
all evergreen trees shall be a minimum of 6 to 7 feet in height. Said
trees shall be planted no closer than 8 feet to any parcel line. Trees
may include evergreens not to exceed 25% of the total, unless
determined by the Planning Board to be used for screening.
6. Shrubs should be planted with a mix of 60% flowering and 40%
evergreen. At the time of planting all shrubs, whether deciduous or
evergreen, should be 24 to 30 inches in height and/or 18 to 24 inches
spreading.
21
D. Buffers and Screens
1. Buffers - Where necessary to mitigate the impact of a land use on
neighboring properties or the neighborhood, the Planning Board may
require that all or some of the minimum landscaped areas required
herein be planted as an opaque or semi-opaque buffer(s) and
increased in width, by the amount shown in the Table 1, above the
standard indicated in Section 5.7.3.C.1:

Legend: o=opaque; s=semi-opaque; *=minimum landscape area
2. Standards for Opaqueness - Buffers and screens shall be either
opaque or semi-opaque, as determined by the Planning Board, based
on the width of the landscaped area and the extent of negative impact
of the use or facility being screened or buffered.
a. Opaque - excludes all visual contact between uses and creates
a strong impression of spatial separation. The opaque buffer is
opaque from ground level to 6 feet in height with intermittent
vegetation from 6 feet to at least 30 feet in height and shall be planted
at a minimum of I shade tree or evergreen tree with conical shape and
1 understory tree per 300 square feet and as many evergreen shrubs
as is necessary to exclude all visual contact from ground level to 6
feet in height.
b. Semi-opaque - partially blocks visual contact between uses
and creates a strong impression of the separation of spaces. The
semi-opaque buffer is opaque from the ground level I to 3 feet in
height with intermittent vegetation from 3 feet to at least 30 feet in
height and shall be planted at a minimum of 1 shade tree and 1
understory tree per 300 square feet and as many shrubs as
necessary to partially block visual contact from ground level to 3 feet
in height.
22
3. Screens - Screens, shall be provided for service areas and facilities,
such as garbage and waste disposal containers, recycling bins, and
loading areas; outside storage areas; and, electrical and mechanical
equipment such as transformers and compressors; or for any other
similar facilities or areas required by the Planning Board.
4. Any plant material used for screening or buffering shall become
effective within 3 years.
5. Plants shall be placed in a random manner to blend with the natural
landscape and to avoid a linear plantation appearance.
E. Other Buffers - When reviewing an application and any special
circumstances that may be associated with the parcel, the Board may require
a buffer along streams and rivers and other bodies of water as advised by
the USDA Natural Resource Conservation Service, along roadways of
special character or those designated by the Town as scenic roads, and
natural and historic landmarks.
F. Landscaping Around Buildings
1. Landscaping around buildings should be provided to buffer parking
areas, to define entrances, to provide foundation planting, and to
soften large expanses of walls or long roof lines.
2. Building landscape beds should be planted with trees, shrubs, and
ground cover appropriate to the architecture.
G. Landscaping of Parking Areas
1. For all parking lots containing 20 or more parking spaces, internal
landscaped aisles or islands, planted with shade trees, should be
considered.
2. Parking areas should also be screened along lot lines bordering
residential or institutional uses.
H. Roadside Trees/Walls - Because roadside trees are extremely important to
the character of any town, removal of trees over twelve (12) inches in
diameter (measured at chest height) must be absolutely minimized,
especially along roadways. Removal of existing trees can usually be
lessened by shifting the site of the building, parking lot or the entrance/exit.
23
Roadside trees should meet the following criteria:
1. cast moderate to dense shade in summer;
2. be long-lived, i.e., over 60 years;
3. be tolerant of pollution and direct or reflected heat;
4. require little maintenance, by being mechanically strong and insect
and disease resistant;
5. be able to survive two (2) years with no irrigation after establishment;
and
6. be of native origin, provided that they meet the above criteria.
Where stone walls exist, care should be taken to disturb them as little as
possible, since they also act to retain the character of country roads
I. Maintenance and Materials
1. The property owner shall be responsible for maintaining all
landscaping, to include grass and mulch, in good, healthy condition so
as to present a neat and orderly appearance. The property owner
shall replace any unhealthy or dead plant materials in conformance
with the landscape plan approved by the Board as part of the site
plan.
2. All plant material shall be hardy for USDA Plant Hardiness Zone 4 or
less.
1. All plant material intended for placement in areas that are susceptible
to salt laden run-off shall be of a salt resistant species.
3. Existing Plant Material Credit - The applicant shall save and protect to the
greatest extent possible all existing large trees on the site having a trunk
diameter of at least twelve (12) inches measured 4 feet from finish grade
level.
4. Prohibition of Sight-Obscuring Landscaping Features - All plantings, fences,
and walls necessitated by these landscaping and screening guidelines shall
be pruned and maintained in a manner such that the safety of the traveling
public shall not be compromised.
5. Encroachment on Landscaped Areas - The storage, display, or parking of
vehicles, boats, mobile homes, travel trailers, or construction equipment
24
within landscaped areas, buffers, or screens, shown as such on the
approved landscape plan, is disallowed.
6. Protection of Landscaped Areas - Curbs may be required where appropriate
and shall be either concrete or granite or another type approved by the
Board (see Section 5.7.7,L,4 re: Curbing).
7. Adjustments to Landscaping and Screening Requirements - The reuse or
redevelopment of existing sites/buildings for commercial or industrial
purposes may present difficulties in complying with new standards, especially
when properties were originally developed under different and, in most
cases, lesser standards. Therefore, the Board shall use its discretion in
applying these standards to the redevelopment of sites, with the goal of
trying to maximize the amount of landscaped green space which can
practically be obtained in these situations.
8. Impervious Surfaces - The total area of all impervious surfaces on a lot
divided by the Net Land Area of that lot shall not exceed 50%. Impervious
surfaces are those which do not absorb water, including, but not limited to,
buildings, structures, paved parking areas, driveways, roads, walkways, and
any area of concrete or asphalt, and areas for outside storage of vehicles or
machinery. Where slopes exceed 14% the maximum impervious coverage
shall be as follows:
Average site area slope Maximum impervious coverage
14% 50%
16% 40%
18% 30%
20% 20%
22% 10%
24% or more 0%
For intermediate slopes the values may be interpolated.
5.7.4 Other Performance Standards
The site development shall not generate or create undesirable and preventable elements
of pollution such as light, noise, vibration, smoke, soot, particulates or other discharge into
the environment which might prove harmful to persons, structures or be in violation of State
and Federal laws. In addition to the following standards for environmental impacts, the
Planning Board, in its sole discretion, may impose other such restrictions if it determines
that such emissions and/or effluents are a potential hazard to health, safety or prosperity.
A. Lighting - Lighting shall be designed, maintained and operated so as not to
increase off-site illumination more than two-tenths (0.2) foot-candle above
25
pre-development levels as measured at all points on the property line five
feet above grade. Lighting shall be designed so as not to directly illuminate
abutting lots not already in commercial use, or streets and highways. All
reasonable efforts shall be made to avoid glare or light over-spill onto
residential premises. These may include but are not limited to shielding,
lower light intensity, lower pole heights, reflectors and cut-off fixtures. This
standard shall not apply to public street lighting.
On-site lighting along roadways, railways and parking areas shall be
designed with consideration to luminaire mounting, height, spacing and
distribution of light to assure adequate illumination for the safety of vehicles
and pedestrian travel. Such lighting shall not interfere with traffic on nearby
public highways. Standards and guidelines contained in the IES Lighting
Handbook, Section 14, shall be utilized to determined the appropriateness
of exterior lighting and conformity with these Regulations. The Board may
require additional street lighting to meet safety needs on adjacent Town
streets/highways and require the applicant to pay the utility for the cost of
service.
No flickering or flashing lights shall be permitted. Processes, such as arc
welding, which create light flashes shall be confined within buildings or
shielded to prevent either direct glare or flashes.
2. Noise - Sound pressure levels must not exceed the limits indicated in Table 2
at the boundary line of each of the use categories of contiguous properties
indicated:
Table 2. Maximum permissible noise levels
Use category dB(A) limit re: 0.0002 microbar
Residential 56
Commercial 63
Light industry 65
Heavy industry 70
Noise levels shown above are subject to the following adjustments:
1. Noise present at nighttime: Subtract 7 dB(A)
2. Noise is impulsive (meter reading changes at a rate greater
than 10 dB(A) per second): Subtract 7 dB(A)
EXPLANATION: dB(A) levels - 70=harmful; 60=stressful; 45=harms sleep
2. Glare or Heat - Operations producing glare or heat shall be conducted within
a completely enclosed building or with other effective screening in such a
26
manner as to make glare or heat completely imperceptible from any point
along any lot line of the proposed development. Emissions of heat or glare
shall in no case endanger human health, cause damage to vegetation or
property, interfere with the normal operation of equipment or instruments, or
interfere with the reasonable use and enjoyment of property located outside
the lot of the proposed development.
3. Emissions of Gases, Smoke And Particulate Matter - No emissions of smoke
or particulate matter shall be permitted which exceeds any local, State of
New Hampshire or Federal applicable standard for stationary sources of air
contaminants. In no case shall any such emissions represent a hazard to
human health or safety or be greater than pre-development ambient levels at
any point along the lot lines of the proposed project.
4. Vibrations - Every use shall be so designed that the ground vibration
inherently and recurrently generated is not perceptible, without instruments,
at an point on the boundary line of the lot of the proposed development.
Vibrations from temporary construction and vehicles which leave the lot
(such as trucks and trains) are excluded.
5. Odors - No emission of odorous air contaminants shall be permitted such as
to result in detectable odors which are measured in excess of the following
limits:
For odorous air emissions from lots which are contiguous to one or more
residential lots, or unused lots located in a zone in which residential use is
permitted, odors shall not be detectable after the odorous air has been
diluted with a maximum of 5 volumes of odor-free air. For all other lots odors
shall not be detectable after the odorous air has been diluted with a
maximum of 10 volumes of odor-free air.
All of the above requirements not withstanding, no odor from the proposed
project, when in operation, shall be permitted which is detectable at any point
along the lot lines of the proposed project.
In addition to the above standards, the proposed development shall comply
with all applicable local, State of New Hampshire and Federal air pollution
control regulations.
6. Radioactivity - The airborne emissions of radioactive material shall comply
with all State and Federal Regulations.
7. Electromagnetic Interference - Electromagnetic interference with radio and
television reception is prohibited. In no case shall the proposed development
produce harmful radiations in any part of the electromagnetic spectrum,
27
measured at any point on the property lines of the proposed development.
1. Hazardous, Inflammable and Explosive Materials - If the proposed project
intends to use and/or store hazardous, inflammable or explosive materials
(including hazardous wastes) on site, the project shall be designed to comply
with all fire and building codes for the materials and adequate precautions
shall be taken to protect against negative off-site release, using the best
available technology. A hazardous materials impact analysis shall be
required to determine potential off-site impacts and required mitigation
precautions.
2. Setbacks - No parking area for a commercial or industrial use shall be built or
maintained within a minimum of ten (10) feet of any boundary line of a
residential use, or within a minimum of ten (10) feet of a street line, where
street line functions as the boundary line between a residential zone and the
site proposed for development; however, the Planning Board may require
increased setbacks for parking areas depending upon the extent and
intensity of vehicular activity.
To meet any of the performance standards either described herein or
otherwise identified by the Planning Board, the Board may require setbacks
of buildings and facilities greater than that required for the zone in which the
site is located. In no case shall the setback be reduced below that required
for the abutting properties.
5.7.5 Utilities and Fire Protection
The Planning Board may require adequate fire protection measures to ensure safe access
to and around buildings and sites for fire fighting purposes
Provisions shall be made for the site to be serviced by necessary utilities which may
include water for fire protection, whether sprinklers, town supply or others, as
recommended by the Fire Chief, and for domestic use. In the event that a site is not
serviced by Town water mains, then the following standards shall apply in order to provide
minimum requirements for water supply for fire-fighting, and a reasonable degree of
protection to life and property.
2. There shall be located on site a water storage facility capable of delivering
required fire flows as determined by using the ISO formula for required fire
flow. Such storage and delivery systems will meet the requirements of
National Fire Protection Act (NFPA) #22, Water Tanks for Private Fire
Protection, and NFPA #24, Private Fire Service Mains and their
appurtenances.
3. If proper improvements to be constructed are to be sprinklered, either by
28
Building Code requirements or applicant's choice, water storage capacity
shall be determined by NFPA #13, Installation of Sprinkler Systems, or NFPA
#13D, Residential Sprinkler Systems. In no case shall storage capacity be
less than 10,000 gallons of usable water.
4. The supply of water for fire-fighting purposes shall be located and maintained
so as to be accessible year round to Fire Department apparatus. Such
supply shall be within a 1,000 foot hose lay of all structures.
5. The Board shall obtain from the Fire Department its comments on
compliance with these standards.
Nothing contained herein shall relieve the applicant of complying with
applicable provisions of the Charlestown Building Code.
5.7.6 Fees, Assessments in Effect at Time of Connection
The applicant/landowner shall pay all fees, required by an applicable Town Ordinance for
connection to any municipal utility which fees or assessments are in effect at the time an
application is made for connection.
5.7.7 Coordination of Roadway, Streets, Parking, Loading, Recreation and Safety
21. Public Highway Access - The public highways and Town streets providing
access to the site shall be sufficient and have adequate capacity for the
safety of vehicles, pedestrians and bicycles. Provisions shall be made for
safe accommodation of pedestrian traffic along fronting streets in the vicinity
of the site. This will include the public highways which constitute the main
traffic arteries which must be utilized by traffic to and from the Site. The
Board shall not approve a proposed site plan without such sufficient and
adequate access capacity. If a proposed site plan is rejected, the Board
shall make findings as to the insufficiency and inadequate capacity of the
public highways involved.
No lot in any zone shall be approved for use which does not have frontage
upon, or deeded access from, a pre-existing, town maintained road, as
required in RSA 674:41. The frontage requirements specified herein or in
Section 8.5 of the Town of Charlestown Zoning Ordinance shall apply to the
distance measured along a pre-existing town maintained road.
22. Traffic Patterns - The traffic patterns on and at the site shall be coordinated
so as to compose a convenient system.

anticipated level of employees, clients, customers, suppliers,
residents, visitors and all others who would customarily occupy the
site.
2. Parking areas for multi-family homes shall include provisions for a
minimum of two (2) off-street parking spaces for each unit.
D. Traffic Impacts - For Major Site Plans, applicants may be required to provide
a traffic impact study, and such development shall be authorized only upon
determination by the responsible regulatory body that, based upon facilities
as existing or committed to be improved by the Town or the applicant, the
following will be met:
1. Sight distance at the point of egress shall meet American Association
of State Highway Traffic Officials (AASHTO) or State of New
Hampshire Department of Transportation standards, based on
observed (not posted) speeds.
2. On no lane of any street or intersection shall the volume/capacity ratio
be increased by more than 0.1 above baseline as a result of the
proposed development, with baseline being the ratio resulting from
the traffic forecast in five years, given development of the premises
for single-family residences, as allowed under the Zoning Ordinance,
with no density bonuses.
Loading, unloading and delivery facilities shall be provided off-street. Loading
space shall be accessible when all designated vehicle parking spaces are
occupied and vice-versa.
5. Access/Egress to Parking and Loading Facilities - The access/egress to a
parking facility shall be clearly marked and signed and said markings/signs
maintained year around. One-way entrances shall be 13 to 15 feet wide and
two-way, 24 to 28 feet wide. Access/egress points should be at least 100
feet away from another entrance on the street. Access/egress curb cuts
shall be aligned with on-site parking design. Through traffic on fronting
streets shall not be significantly impeded or endangered by vehicles entering
or leaving the site.
6. Improvements - Improvements to off-site existing streets may include signal
30
devices if necessary because of increased traffic generated by the
development.
7. Multi-Family Structures - Site plans for multi-family structures shall make
adequate provision for the on-site recreational needs of the residents of the
proposed development. The plan shall be designed to minimize the likelihood
that public safety will be endangered by the use of internal and external
roads and parking areas for recreational use.
8. Emergency Access - Each site shall have adequate access from public
highways and sufficient maneuvering room for fire, police and emergency
vehicles. The Fire Department shall provide information indicating whether or
not this requirement is satisfied by the proposed plan. Minimum access
requirements shall include forty-five (45) feet turning radius and twenty-two
(22) foot fire lanes at the rear of the buildings.
1. Internal Circulation - The Board at its discretion may require that parking
areas and areas for internal circulation on the Site shall be physically
delineated (for instance, by curbing) so as to protect adjacent grass and
plantings and pedestrians.
17. Paving of Parking Areas - Pavement may be required at the discretion of the
Planning Board, depending on site conditions. Pavement specifications will
be reviewed by the Public Works Director or other individual designated by
the Planning Board. Parking spaces shall be a minimum of 9 x 18 feet.
Aisles between parallel rows of spaces shall be a minimum of 24 feet apart
with 26 feet preferred. Pavement cross-sections shall include a minimum of
three inches of bituminous pavement and 14 inches of gravel, in accordance
with the specifications contained within Town of Charlestown Subdivision
Regulations. Alternative parking designs may be considered by the Board
after the design has been reviewed by the Public Works Director or other
individual assigned by the Board. The Board may modify the requirements
contained herein when it is appropriate to use a substitute for paving
because of storm drainage considerations and/or aesthetic considerations,
so long as the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic is assured.
18. Loading Areas - All loading areas shall be designed so as not to interfere
with other planned circulation on the site and so as to provide adequate
space and facilities.
19. Drainage, Snow Removal, Curbing and Flood-proofing - The applicant shall
provide written assurance from the Public Works Director and, if requested, a
consultant selected by the Board, that provisions for handling surface and
subsurface waters, storm drainage and melting snow are adequate and will
not adversely affect abutting properties or Town facilities.
31
1. Provision shall be made for handling water drainage on the site to
prevent flooding of the site or that of another property. Drainage onto
adjacent properties shall not be increased so as to impair the
reasonable use of that property and may be so diverted only after
public hearing and written approval from the property owner of the
land receiving such drainage.
2. .Adequate disposition and treatment of stormwater runoff shall be
provided. Storm drainage of the site shall be designed for a twentyfive
(25) year storm and, if the existing drainage system to which the
site drainage system will be connected is inadequate, provisions shall
be made for retention and gradual release of storm water in order to
meet the 25 year storm demand and to emulate the rate and timing of
pre-development off-site discharge. Combined off-site storm-water
handling and treatment facilities may be substituted for on-site
systems provided easements are obtained which allow for the
construction, use and maintenance of these facilities.
3. Drainage facilities shall employ sediment basins, oil and gas traps,
and other facilities as necessary to assure maintenance of the quality
of surface and ground waters.
1. All sites shall have curbing around paved parking and driveway areas
and closed drainage systems. Curbing in zones A, B, C and D and
G-1 shall be granite. Curbing in all other zones shall be concrete or
granite. The Board may modify the requirements contained herein
when it is appropriate because of expense and/or aesthetic
consideration, so long as the safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic
is assured.
5. Adequate areas for snow storage and removal must be provided
during the winter months. An area equal to at least 20% of the
parking, aisle and driveway areas will be generally required for on-site
snow storage.
The following aspects will be considered in reviewing the adequacy of
the snow storage/removal plan:
a. Accessibility and topography of designated storage areas;
b. Width of the storage site, ten (10) feet is normally considered
to be the minimum acceptable width; and
c. Any potentially adverse effects on neighboring properties from
32
snow melt and runoff, the landscaping of on-site or
neighboring properties and traffic access and safety.
6. Provisions shall be made to assure that the proposal is consistent
with the need to minimize flood damage to installations such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, which are elevated and/or
constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and that adequate
drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure and flood hazards.
7. Design provisions shall also be made to minimize or eliminate
infiltration of flood waters into new or replacement water supply
systems and/or sanitary sewer systems and discharges from these
systems into flood-waters. On-site waste disposal systems shall be
located so as to avoid their impairment or contamination from them
during flooding.
15. Groundwater Protection - The quality of groundwater shall not be adversely
affected by the proposed development. This shall be established by the
applicant showing that the proposed development will not violate the rules
and regulations of the Division of Water Supply and Pollution Control with
regard to groundwater. Special attention shall be given to groundwater
quality protection within the Drinking Water Protection District and the
Watershed District.
16. Waste Disposal Facilities - Waste disposal facilities shall be provided onsite.
17. Conformance with Other Local Regulations - All developments shall meet the
standards and requirements included in the Charlestown Zoning Ordinance
and Subdivision Regulations including, but not limited to, parking, location of
off-street loading, landscaping, signs, location of driveways, erosion,
screened service areas and exterior lighting.
5.7.8 Off-site Improvements and Impact Fees
In those cases where new development creates a need for new or upgraded municipal
capital facilities, including highways and sidewalks, sewers, water, police protection, fire
protection, drainage, schools, libraries, parks and recreation areas, the Board shall assess
an impact fee to be paid by the new development. The assessment shall be based on the
following determinations
A. What quantity of facilities are needed to accommodate the new
development?
B. What is the total cost of the facilities needed to accommodate the new
33
development?
C. What revenues will be available to pay for the cost of facilities needed to
accommodate the new development?
D. What is the net cost to accommodate the new development?
The impact fee charged to the new development shall be no more than a proportionate
share of the Town's cost of the new and/or upgraded capital facilities needed to serve such
new development.
The impact fee shall be paid to the Town prior to the issuance of the building permit and
held in a special account established by the Town to be expended on the new or improved
capital facilities which benefit the development. The impact fee shall be expended for the
purposes described herein within ten years from the date of payment or refunded to the
applicant. Impact fees may be accumulated as paid by various applicants until such time
as the amount collected is sufficient with other funds available to the Town to construct or
improve capital facilities to meet the needs created by the new development.
SECTION 5.8 WAIVER PROCEDURE
5.8.1 Waivers
Upon written request of the applicant, the Planning Board may, at its discretion, for cause,
waive any of the requirements for site plan review, and shall so notify the applicant, the
Planning Administrator and Public Works Director of that action. Before granting such a
waiver, the Planning Board must find that the imposition of certain site plan requirements in
a particular case would:
A. Be inconsistent with the intent of the Regulations; and
B. Providing that he applicant has demonstrated that compliance would cause
practical difficulties, including, but not limited to, excessive and unreasonable
expense; and
C. Upon a finding that the waiver, if granted, would not be detrimental to the
Town or to abutters.
5.8.2 Waiver of Public Hearing
The Planning Board shall not waive the requirement for public hearing except in such
instances when no Site Plan Review is required.
34
SECTION 5.9 CONSTRUCTION COMPLETION AND BONDING
5.9.1 Period for Construction and Completion of the Work
The applicant shall construct and complete all design and construction requirements in
accordance with Section 5.7 and any other applicable section of these Regulations, as
required in the Notice of Action, within 2 years from the date of the signing of the site plan
and prior to the issuance of the Certificate of Occupancy.
5.9.2 Bonding and Security
1. Security Before Commencement of Construction - The Board may require
security before any work commences on the development for that portion of
the development that, if not properly completed, will have an adverse effect
on adjoining property or has a potential for erosion. The steps for issuing
and releasing security shall be the same as required in the subdivision
regulations including, but not limited to, determining the amount, the
sufficiency, term and form of the security.
The Board shall specify in its approval of the site plan the amount of any
security to be posted by the applicant for the development of the site in
accordance with the Board's approval. Such security shall be in a form
approved by the Board. The purpose of the security will be to allow the Town
to construct and install improvements as required by the site plan approval in
the event of default by the applicant. The security shall be reduced at the
discretion of the Board as the improvements are completed.
No development may be occupied and no site may be used unless a
certificate of occupancy has been issued by the Building Inspector/Zoning
Administrator. Such certificate shall not be issued until these regulations
have been complied with and the improvements made or security approved
by the Planning Board has been provided to the Town for unfinished
improvements.
2. Security After Commencement of Construction - In the event the applicant is
entitled to a Certificate of Occupancy under the Town of Charlestown
Building Code, except for work such as landscaping and paving which
cannot be completed because of the time the year, for example, due to cold
weather, then the applicant may be required to post a bond in an amount
equal to the cost of completing the work required in the Notice of Action.
(See Section 5.3, Compliance) The Public Works Director may deny the
request for a bond, and deny the Certificate of Occupancy, if he determines
35
that the work could have been completed within the usual construction
season. Such denial may be appealed to the Planning Board by the
applicant. The Planning Board shall either affirm or reverse the decision of
the Public Works Director.
3. Amount of Bond or Other Security - The amount of the bond shall be
determined by the Public Works Director. The applicant shall sign and
deliver a bond in the form required by the Town. The security shall be in the
form of a letter of credit or escrow account or similar security, but shall not be
in the form of a mortgage on real estate or a security interest in equipment or
inventory. A bond issued by a surety company registered to do business in
the State of New Hampshire shall satisfy the requirement.
The bond and security shall be released when the Public Works Director is
satisfied that the applicant has complied with all requirements set forth in the
Notice of Action. If the applicant has not complied within the period of time
specified in the bond, then the Town shall enforce its rights under the bond
and the security. In the event the Town is required to take any legal action to
enforce the bond and security, the Town shall be entitled to an award of
reasonable attorney's fees incurred in the enforcement.
5.9.3 Changes and Alterations of an Approved Site Plan
After the Planning Board's approval of a site plan, it shall be the landowner's responsibility
to ensure that construction and site development does not deviate from the approved site
plan. Any proposed changes to the approved site plan shall be presented to the Planning
Administrator for review. The Planning Administrator shall determine if the change is minor
or major and shall report such changes to the Planning Board. Minor changes shall require
the submission of an amended final site plan application and may be approved by the
Planning Administrator after consultation with the Planning Board.
For major changes the Planning Board, after Notice and public hearing, may approve such
changes and alterations. The applicant shall submit a revised application and Site Plan for
approval. Approval by the Planning Board and Notice of Action is required before
construction can proceed on major changes.
Minor changes, by way of illustration, may include, but are not limited to, minor building or
site adjustments due to unusual conditions encountered on-site during construction or an
improvement in design such as greater setbacks or more landscaped open space.
Major changes, by way of illustration, may include, but are not limited to, major building or
site adjustments which as a result would render the site plan in non-compliance with one or
more requirements of the Town, which result in either the movement of utility line(s) or
access(es), which create the potential of adversely affecting an abutting property as a
36
result of the change or which otherwise may be contrary to the purpose and scope of these
regulations.
Failure of the property owner to obtain the Board's review of other than minor changes in
the approved site plan shall cause the Board of Selectmen to issue a "stop work" order on
their own motion or at the request of the Planning Board or Planning Administrator,
detailing the reasons therefore, and such other enforcement measures deemed
appropriate and necessary to ensure compliance with these regulations. A stop work order
shall include a provision giving the property owner ten (10) business days to request in
writing a hearing before the Board of Selectmen on the term and conditions of said stop
work order. Said hearing shall occur within ten (10) business days of receipt of said
requests. Dates of notice and/or hearing shall not be counted in the above time periods.
This provision does not alter or amend either party's rights of enforcement or appeal
pursuant to RSA 676:15-19.
SECTION 5.10 FINES AND PENALTIES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF
These regulations shall be enforced, as provided in RSA Chapters 676:15 and 676:17, and
in the event of any violation, the Selectmen shall authorize legal action for injunctive relief
and/or such fines and penalties as may be provided by law, including but not limited to any
and all remedies and relief as may be available under RSA Chapter 676.
SECTION 5.11 AMENDMENT
Amendments to these Regulations shall be made in the manner as required by law.
SECTION 5.12 SEPARABILITY
If any provision of these Regulations shall be held to be invalid, for any reason by any
court, such holding shall not invalidate any other provisions contained herein.
SECTION 5.13 APPEALS
Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Planning Board hereunder may appeal the
decision to the Sullivan County Superior Court within thirty (30) days after the filing of the
Planning Boardis decision pursuant to the provisions of RSA 677:15.
SECTION 5.14 OTHER REGULATIONS
Where these regulations are in conflict with other local ordinances, the more stringent shall
37
apply.
SECTION 5.15 EFFECTIVE DATE
This Ordinance shall take effect upon its passage and as modified after public hearings.
Adopted December 17, 1976
Amended May 20, 1980
Amended March 5, 1985
Amended February 4, 1986
Amended January 5, 1999
SECTION 5.16 APPLICATION OF AMENDMENTS
These Regulations shall not apply to any completed application accepted prior to the first
notice of these amendments, nor shall any approved site plan be affected. The regulations
in effect at the time of the accepted completed application shall continue to apply. The
effective date of these amendments is the date of filing with the Clerk of the Town of
Charlestown.

Board, hereby certify that, on January 5, 1999, they amended the Site Plan Review
Regulations, as contained in this document, after notice and public hearing, as required by

environs;
4.2.2 Provide against such scattered and premature subdivision of land as would
involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of
water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public
services, or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply
of such services;
4.2.3 Ensure the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within subdivisions in
relation to other existing or planned streets or with features of the official map;
4.2.4 Provide open space of adequate character and proportion;

of such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to
health, the natural environment or the character of the community;
4.2.6 Provide suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and
prospective traffic and to afford adequate light, air, and access for emergency
vehicles and equipment, and coordinated so as to compose a convenient
system;
4.2.7 Provide safe pedestrian and bicycle access;

4.4.6 Conditional Approval
1) The Board may grant conditional approval of an application, but the plat
will not be signed or recorded until all of the conditions have been met. If
the applicant has not complied with the conditions of approval within one
(1) year, the approval shall be considered null and void and the applicant
must submit a new subdivision application.
2) Conditions involving discretionary judgment by the Planning Board to
ascertain compliance shall require a further Public Hearing with full notice
to abutters and the public. Such conditions include but are not limited to
the submittal of revised plans or documents addressing design,
construction, technical or legal issues raised in the course of the Board’s
review of the application.

A. are purely administrative in nature;
B. involve no discretionary judgment on the part of the Board;
C. involve the applicant's possession of permits and approvals granted
by other boards or agencies such as the Department of
Transportation, Department of Environmental Services or other
state/federal agencies. However, any subsequent change to the
plan required by such permits or approvals would constitute
grounds for a new application process.

1) The Planning Board may allow for an expedited review of applications for
lot line adjustments or minor subdivisions, as defined in Sections 4.3.10
and 4.3.19 of these regulations.

the same meeting, provided the required public notice so indicates.
3) The Board may, in its sole discretion, waive certain plat requirements for
lot line adjustments and minor subdivisions.

Prior to the approval of any subdivision, a public hearing shall be held pursuant
to RSA 676:4,I (d & e). Public hearings may be waived for lot line adjustments,
boundary agreements which do not create buildable lots or minor subdivisions as
defined in Sections 4.3.10 and 4.3.19, unless requested by the Planning Board,

Board the full estimated cost of any professional review prior to the Board
Revised Regulations – Adopted March 18, 2003
10
initiating the professional review. Failure to pay such costs shall constitute valid
grounds for the Board to terminate further consideration of the application and to
disapprove the Plat without a public hearing.
4.4.12 Site Inspections
1) All applications are conditioned upon the owner allowing access to the
property by the Board and/or its designees, to the extent reasonable and
necessary to properly review the application. Denial of access shall
constitute grounds for the Board to terminate further consideration of the
proposal and disapprove the application.
2) Site inspections by a majority of the Board members at the same time
shall be posted as meetings of the Board pursuant to the Right-to-Know
provisions of RSA 91-A. If there is a quorum of the Board present at the

4.4.13 Procedure When Approvals from the ZBA are Required
When approval of a Special Exception or Variance from the Zoning Board of
Adjustment (ZBA) is required by the Zoning Ordinance, the applicant shall first
obtain such approval before applying for Subdivision approval. Any applications
submitted without the necessary zoning approvals shall be deemed incomplete.
Any conditions imposed by the ZBA shall not be diminished by the requirements
contained in these Regulations. The condition that imposes the greater
restriction or higher standard shall apply.
4.4.14 Procedure When Site Plan Approval is Required
When both subdivision and site plan approval are required on a proposed
development, the Board may hold the Site Plan Review hearing at the same time
as the hearing required for the final plat by the Subdivision Regulations.

4.4.16 Previously Approved Subdivisions – Four Year Exemption
As provided in RSA 674:39, every plat approved by the Board and properly
recorded with the Sullivan County Registry of Deeds shall be exempt from all
subsequent changes in Subdivision Regulations adopted by the Board, except
those regulations and ordinances which expressly protect public health
standards, such as water quality and sewage treatment requirements, for a
period of four (4) years after the date of recording, subject to each of the
following conditions:
1) active and substantial development or building shall have commenced on the
site by the owner or his successor in interest in accordance with the approved
plat within twelve (12) months after the date of approval, or in accordance
with the terms of said approval and where a bond to cover the costs of roads,
drains or sewers is required in connection with such approval, such bond is
posted with the Town at the time of commencement of such development;
2) development remains in full compliance with the public health regulations and
ordinances specified in this section; and
3) at the time of approval and recording the plat conforms to the subdivision
regulations and zoning ordinances then in effect at the site of each plat.
4) As part of its approval of a plat or plan, the Planning Board may, with due
regard to the scope and details of a particular project, specify the threshold
level of work which shall constitute “active and substantial development or
building” for purposes of fulfilling paragraph 1 of this section, or may, for good
cause extend the twelve (12) month period set forth in paragraph 1.
4.4.17 Securing and Signing of the Plat
The Planning Board must sign the final subdivision plat before it can be recorded
which must occur before lots in the subdivision may be legally sold. The two
methods available to the subdivider to secure the Planning Board’s approval to
sign the final plat when improvements are required are as follows:
1) Security Prior to Signing of the Plat: Before the subdivider starts
installation or construction of improvements such as streets or roads,
water or sewer service facilities, drainage structures or other utilities, the
subdivider shall furnish security in an amount and form acceptable to the
Board. The purpose of this security will be to provide the funds necessary
to install the improvements in the subdivision required by the Board in the
event the subdivider fails to do so for any reason, including, but not limited
to, insolvency, and/or bankruptcy.
A. Amount: The amount of security shall be determined by the
Board and shall be sufficient to cover the costs of construction
and installation of all subdivision improvements and the
estimated cost of inflation over the projected term of the security
Revised Regulations – Adopted March 18, 2003
12
(not to exceed three years), not to exceed 10% per year. The
subdivider must file with the Board a registered engineer's
detailed estimate of the costs of the improvements together with
maps, plans and supporting data.
B. Form: An irrevocable letter of credit is the preferred form of
security. A suggested form for an irrevocable letter of credit
may be found in Appendix B. Irrevocable letters of credit with
language differing from the suggested form or alternative forms
of security must be approved by the Planning Board and may
require consultation with Town Counsel at the Planning Board's
discretion. The Board will not accept mortgages or escrow
accounts from each lot sale as security.
Where a surety bond is required, it shall be issued by a surety
company authorized to do business in the State of New
Hampshire and shall be approved as to form and sureties by the
legal counsel of the Town of Charlestown.
C. Release of Security: Release of any security after completion of
improvements shall occur only with the approval of the Planning
Board after recommendation by the Superintendent of Public
Works.
D. Signing and Recording the Plat: Where security has been
furnished as required by the Board, the subdivider shall then
present the plat for signature by the Board Chair and recording.
Upon the recording of the signed plat, the subdivider may then
sell lots even though the improvements have not yet been
constructed.
E. Time for Completion of Improvements: Where security is
furnished, the subdivider must construct and install the
improvements within 36 months from receipt of the Notice of
Action that all conditions, if any, have been met and final
subdivision approval has been granted. The subdivider may
request a time extension beyond the 36 months for completion
of the improvements and the Planning Board may, for good
cause shown, approve such a request. Alternatively, the
subdivider may apply for merger to combine the subdivided lots
and void the subdivision, providing for release of the security for
the improvements. If the improvements have not been
completed within 36 months and no time extension has been
approved by the Planning Board, the Selectboard may use the
security to complete the improvements.
2) Construction of Required Improvements Prior to Signing of the Plat: The
subdivider shall construct and install all improvements required by the
Planning Board within 36 months from the receipt of the Notice of Action
Revised Regulations – Adopted March 18, 2003
13
by the subdivider from the Planning Board. Within that same time period,
the subdivider shall present the plat to be signed by the Board after the
improvements have been installed and approved by the Board. The plat
will be signed by the Board Chair and recorded in the Sullivan County
Registry of Deeds, at which time the subdivider may begin to sell and
convey lots in the subdivision.
4.4.18 Recording of Final Plat
No sale or transfer of land within a subdivision may be entered into until an
approved final subdivision plat has been recorded with the Registry of Deeds of
Sullivan County. If subdivision improvements are required by the Planning Board,
then these improvements must be secured by the applicant by one of the
methods outlined in Section 4.4.17 above prior to signing and recording the final
plat. If the subdivision is approved by the Planning Board with conditions the
applicant shall have twelve months, unless an extension is approved by the
Board, to demonstrate compliance with those conditions before the final plat can
be signed and recorded. The subdivider shall submit to the Board two mylar
copies of the approved plat for signature and recording. Within thirty days after
the plat has been signed by the Board Chair, the Board or its designee shall
transmit the signed plat to the Registry of Deeds of Sullivan County for recording
at the expense of the subdivider. It shall be the responsibility of the Board to
notify the subdivider of the book, page and date of recording. The second signed
mylar copy of the plat shall be filed in the Office of the Selectboard. The act of
signing and recording an approved subdivision Plat shall not in itself constitute
acceptance by the Town of any street or easement shown thereon.
4.4.19 Official Map
If there exists an Official Map of the town, the recordation of plats that have been
approved as provided herein shall without further action modify the Official Map
in accordance therewith. Recordation of an approved subdivision plat shall not
constitute acceptance by the Town of any street, easement or open space shown
thereon.
4.4.20 Acceptance of Streets and Open Space
No street or open space will be accepted by the Town until such time as all
improvements have been carried out as shown on the final plat, in accordance
with the requirements of these regulations, and subject to any conditions
established by the Planning Board at the time of final plat approval. Final
subdivision approval by the Planning Board or approval by the Planning Board of
required improvements shall not constitute acceptance of the street(s) or other
improvements for ownership and maintenance by the Town of Charlestown.
Acceptance of roads or streets for public maintenance shall occur only in
accordance with the provisions of New Hampshire law.
Revised Regulations – Adopted March 18, 2003

SECTION 4.6 GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR SUBDIVISION
OF LAND
4.6.1 Compliance: No subdivision plan shall be approved unless such plan complies
with all applicable local ordinances and regulations. The Building Inspector shall
not issue a Building Permit or a Certificate of Occupancy under the Town
Building Code for any building in a subdivision that does not comply with the
Notice of Action rendered with the approval of the subdivision plan. For any
requirement of the Notice of Action to be performed in the future, security which
has been posted under Section 4.4.17 will satisfy the condition for the issuance
of the Building Permit or Certificate of Occupancy.
4.6.2 Character of Land for Subdivision: Land of such character that it cannot, in
the judgment of the Board, be safely used for building purposes because of
exceptional danger to health or peril from fire, flood, poor drainage, excessive
slope, poor access or other hazardous conditions, shall not be platted for
residential, commercial or industrial subdivision, nor for such other uses as may
increase danger to life or property, or aggravate the flood hazard. Land with
inadequate characteristics or capacity for sanitary disposal shall not be
subdivided for residential, commercial or industrial subdivision purposes unless
connected to a municipal sewage system or other sewage disposal system
designed by a NH licensed engineer, certifying that the proposed system will not
jeopardize water supplies on that or adjacent lots.
4.6.3 Premature Subdivision: Scattered, premature or inappropriate subdivision of
land that would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason
of lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other
public services, or necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the
supply of such services shall not be approved by the Board.
The following items shall be considered in determining whether the proposed
subdivision is scattered or premature. The subdivider may be required to have
studies made as specified by the Planning Board to determine the effect that the
proposed subdivision may have:
1) capacity of the school system and effect on school bus transportation;
2) adequacy of the access street(s);
3) adequacy of water supply for domestic and fire-fighting purposes,
including available water sources suitable for pumping;
Revised Regulations – Adopted March 18, 2003
20
4) potential health problems due to on-site sewage systems or inadequate
water supply;
5) potential special policing problems;
6) potential drainage problems either on the site or downstream;
7) other potential problems related to a development that would necessitate
excessive expenditure of public funds to correct or address properly.
If a hazard is created by the present level of development, given the current
condition of access roads, the Planning Board may find that proposed
development is premature.
4.6.4 Preservation of Existing Features: Wherever feasible, suitable steps shall be
taken to preserve and protect significant existing features such as trees, scenic
points, stone walls, rock outcroppings, water bodies, and historic landmarks.
Where possible, boundary line(s) should follow existing stone walls.
4.6.5 Lots
1. The layout of lots shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance. Each lot in a proposed subdivision shall have the minimum
street frontage prescribed for the zone in which the lot is located. If no
minimum street frontage is prescribed in the zone, each lot shall have
minimum street frontage as follows:
a. if served by both municipal water and sewer - 100 feet
b. if not served by both municipal water and sewer - 200 feet
2. When lots are developed along a town road leaving backlots, each backlot
must have a minimum of 50 feet of frontage on the Town road to provide
for access. At no point in the access shall the lot width be less than 50
feet. All backlots shall have a minimum lot width at the building line not
less than the required frontage for zone in which they are located.
3. No subdivision shall be approved which does not provide access to
backland or which creates land-locked lots.
4. Lot depth shall normally not exceed 5 times the frontage unless there is
frontage on more than one Town road.
5. Areas set aside for parks and playgrounds to be dedicated or reserved for
the common use of all property owners shall be of reasonable size and
character for neighborhood playgrounds or other recreational uses.
6. Lots shall be laid out and graded to eliminate flooding and/or standing
water. No water shall be permitted to run across a street on the surface,
Revised Regulations – Adopted March 18, 2003
21
but shall be directed into stormwater facilities designed and constructed in
accordance with the Town of Charlestown Guideline Specifications and
Details for Highway, Water and Wastewater Projects.
4.6.6 Reserve Strips: Reserve strips of land that show an intent on the part of the
applicant to control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated for public use shall not
be permitted.
4.6.7 Septic Systems and Water Supply
1. In areas not currently served by public sewer systems, it shall be the
responsibility of the applicant or his agent to provide the necessary state
approvals for the installation and operation of an individual sewage
disposal system. In subdividing parcels with existing dwellings, the
applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the board that the
existing septic system is in good working order.
2. All new wells shall have a protective radius of seventy-five (75) feet, said
radius to be located entirely on its own lot. No septic system, stump
disposal area or other source of potential contaminants shall be located
within the 75-foot protective radius.

Town of Charlestown, New Hampshire
A. Purpose & Authority :
This small wind energy systems ordinance is enacted in accordance with RSA 674:62-66,
and the purposes outlined in RSA 672:1-III-a. The purpose of this ordinance is to
accommodate small wind energy systems in appropriate locations, while protecting the
public’s health, safety and welfare. In addition, this ordinance provides a permitting
process for small wind energy systems to ensure compliance with the provisions of the
requirements and standards established herein.
B. Definitions:
Meteorological tower (met tower). Includes the tower, base plate, anchors, guy wires
and hardware, anemometers (wind speed indicators), wind direction vanes, booms to hold
equipment for anemometers and vanes, data loggers, instrument wiring, and any
telemetry devices that are used to monitor or transmit wind speed and wind flow
characteristics over a period of time for either instantaneous wind information or to
characterize the wind resource at a given location. For the purpose of this ordinance, met
towers shall refer only to those whose purpose are to analyze the environmental factors
needed to assess the potential to install, construct or erect a small wind energy system.
Modification. Any change to the small wind energy system that materially alters the
size, type or location of the small wind energy system. Like-kind replacements shall not
be construed to be a modification.
Net metering. The difference between the electricity supplied to a customer over the
electric distribution system and the electricity generated by the customer’s small wind
energy system that is fed back into the electric distribution system over a billing period.
Power grid. The transmission system, managed by ISO New England, created to
balance the supply and demand of electricity for consumers in New England.
Shadow flicker. The visible flicker effect when rotating blades of the wind generator
cast shadows on the ground and nearby structures causing a repeating pattern of light and
shadow.
Small wind energy system. A wind energy conversion system consisting of a wind
generator, a tower, and associated control or conversion electronics, which has a rated
capacity of 100 kilowatts or less and will be used primarily for onsite consumption.

application for a building permit to construct a small wind energy system. The public
will be afforded 30 days to submit comments to the building inspector prior to the
issuance of the building permit. The building inspector shall review the application
for regional impacts per RSA 36:55. If the proposal is determined to have potential
regional impacts, the building inspector shall follow the procedures set forth in RSA
36:57, IV.
D. Standards :
1. The building inspector shall evaluate the application for compliance with the
following standards;
a. Setbacks: The setback shall be calculated by multiplying the minimum
setback requirement number by the system height and measured from the
center of the tower base to property line, public roads, or nearest point on the

8.5.11.3 – Density - The total number of lots approved will be determined based on the
number that would be otherwise approved under a conventional subdivision plan. The
applicant shall submit a concept plan showing lots, road rights-of-way, and stormwater
management areas, and any other areas which would not be incorporated in individual
lots as necessary to meet the usual minimum standards for the district without the need
for any lot area or lot dimension variances, and accounting for development limitations
such as steep slopes, wetlands, septic suitability, available water supply, adequate
driveway access to each lot, and compliance with the Charlestown subdivision
regulations.
In Zone E (Mixed Use) only, a density bonus of up to 25% will be permitted for
subdivisions that result in the permanent protection of 75% of the total acreage or more
for the protection of resources identified in the Master Plan and/or the Natural
Resources Inventory as important to the community. The protected land must be
appropriately sized, configured and located to achieve the resource protection goals.
The Planning Board’s determination of appropriateness may include consideration of
features of adjacent properties. No density bonus shall be permitted in Zone D
(Watershed).
8.5.11.4 – Dimensions & Arrangement of Lots - The minimum lot size, frontage and
setbacks shall be determined by the Planning Board based on the character of the land
and neighborhood, the adequacy of the soils to support on-site wastewater disposal and
wells (unless served by public water supply and/or wastewater disposal), safety of
access, traffic and pedestrian circulation, impervious surface, and other issues relating
to the future use and enjoyment of the property.
The factors considered by the Planning Board when evaluating the proposed
arrangement of lots shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
14
As amended through March 14, 2017
a. Arrangement of roads, stormwater facilities, wastewater and other utilities in
conformance with the natural features of the parcel, minimizing changes to the
topography.
b. Minimization of impervious cover.
c. Protection of stream corridors and other important habitat areas.
d. Protection of wetlands.
f. Preservation of trees.
g. Feasibility of continued or future agricultural use.
h. Feasibility of continued or future forest management.
i. Relationship to neighboring property, including conservation easements, or
natural, cultural, recreational or scenic features.
j. Connectivity of open space for wildlife habitat.
In no case will lots smaller than 15,000 square feet be permitted. The setbacks from
abutting properties not part of the application shall not be reduced.
Front setbacks may be reduced only when on an internal subdivision road approved by
the Planning Board as part of the subdivision application. When frontage requirements
are reduced, the Planning Board may require shared driveways.
8.5.11.5 – Permanently Protected Area - The lot size averaging plan will concentrate
development away from the most important resource areas and from those areas of the
property that are most environmentally sensitive as described in Section I.
For each lot less than the minimum size normally required for the district, one or more
lots larger than the minimum shall be provided in order to maintain an average lot size
no smaller than the minimum lot size normally required for the district. Permanent
protection from further development shall be provided for an area equal to or exceeding
the sum of the areas by which individual lots are reduced below the minimum normally
required for the district. Further subdivision or use of other than one dwelling unit,
noncommercial outdoor recreation, conservation, agriculture or forestry shall be
prohibited. The protected land shall be shown on the final plat and the conservation
restriction recorded with the Register of Deeds.
8.5.11.6 – Management of Permanently Protected Area - Pursuant to RSA 674:21-a,
Planning Board approval of a final lot size averaging subdivision plan shall result in the
creation of a conservation restriction incorporating the conditions of approval, including
the maximum number of lots and the location, size and permissible uses of the land
area that is to remain undeveloped. If the undeveloped area is to be held in common,
all covenants, deed restrictions, organizational provisions for a homeowner’s
association or equivalent, and any other agreements regarding the method of
ownership, management or maintenance of the protected area shall be established prior
to Planning Board approval of the subdivision plan. By mutual agreement of the
Planning Board and applicant, the conservation restriction may take the form of a
conservation easement to the town/city or private conservation group, or other
instrument approved by the Planning Board.

8.6 SIGNS
8.6.1 – Purpose
The purpose of this section is to provide reasonable guidance for the design and
installation of signs located within our Town. Your Planning Board appreciates the dual
function which signs perform, providing advertising for our business owners and
direction to the general public, for finding the goods and services provided here. Signs,
however, should not detract from the overall rural character of the town, mar scenic
vistas, or be permitted to proliferate excessively. This Ordinance is intended to strike a
balance between the importance of preserving and enhancing our community’s
appearance, the need for protection of the health, safety and welfare of its citizens and
the advertising needs of the business community.
8.6.2 – Permit Required
No permanent sign shall be erected or placed in the Town of Charlestown without a
permit from the Planning Board except as provided in Section 8.6.5. Application for a
sign permit shall be submitted on a form prescribed by the Planning Board shall include
the sign location, design to scale, dimensions, method of illumination, wording, types of
lettering and materials of construction.
The following signs are allowed for permitted uses in the Town. Each of the following
signs requires a permit.
a) One sign per business attached to the building and one freestanding sign
per building.
b) Where structures house more than one business, the freestanding sign
shall be a directory type sign. Directory signs shall be in proportion to the size of
the building and number of businesses therein.
c) All individual business owners shall be required to apply for a permit to
erect any sign pertaining to the business. The property owner shall be required
to apply for directory signs.
d) One sign not exceeding sixteen (16) square feet in area at each entrance
to a subdivision approved by the Planning Board and comprising of 10 or more
dwelling units.
e) Standard off premises directional signs provided and installed by the Town
at the applicant’s expense, not to exceed 6 square feet in area, relating to a
business operated in the Town of Charlestown. Directional signs for any one
enterprise shall not exceed one in any two mile length of road excluding those to
indicate a change of direction. Multiple directional signs at a single location shall
be placed on a common post. The placement of off premise directional signs
requires the permission of the landowner or if located on Town property the
16
As amended through March 14, 2017
approval of the Selectboard. Signs located within the right-of-way of a state
highway shall require a permit NH Department of Transportation
f) Temporary signs advertising charitable, community, civic or cultural events
in Charlestown erected more than two (2) weeks in advance of the event shall
require a permit from the Planning & Zoning Administrator. Such signs must be
removed not later than two (2) days after the event is concluded.
8.6.3 – Sign Design Guidelines - The following guidelines shall be considered by the
applicant in the design of the sign and by the PB in reviewing the sign permit
application:
(a) The size of a sign shall be appropriate to its setting commensurate with its
location (whether in a rural, commercial or residential area), its distance from the
traveled way and the speed of passing traffic. See Section 8.6.4 for specific size
criteria.
(b) Legibility depends more on the color and type of sign rather than actual size.
The size of the sign or the words should be kept in scale with the viewers’ speed,
whether pedestrian or vehicular.
(c) To the extent possible, signs identifying commercial establishments should
generally be placed within a long, continuous information band immediately
above the storefront or directly on the display window.
(d) In industrial or commercial areas, larger freestanding signs should be kept lower
to the ground to balance the size of the sign. The scale of freestanding signs
should be compatible with the body of the buildings they identify and should not
be of a size that would overpower buildings on a particular site.
(e) If the signs are mounted on buildings, they shall be harmonious in scale and
proportion with the building façade upon which they are mounted and with the
architectural elements. They should not detract from the building façade.
(f) All signs shall be constructed of high quality materials and be in a style and
design consistent with the general themes outlined above.
8.6.4 – Sign Design Criteria
(a) No sign shall exceed 16 feet in height or 80 square feet in area in any Zoning
District. Signs identifying home occupations shall not exceed 5 square feet in
area. The frame or supports of the sign shall not be computed in the overall area
unless they are intended to draw attention to or be part of the advertising. If the
sign is irregular in shape, such as cutout letters, the area shall be computed by
drawing a regular shape around the perimeter of the extremities of the sign.
