ALARM SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Police Department  See Ch. 38.
§ 53-1. Legislative findings.
The township governing body finds that may owners and occupants of
residential and commercial premises within the township have installed
various types of alarm devices for the purpose of detecting or preventing
burglary, fire and other perils; that such devices are of different type,
character and quality; that many of such devices have external audible
alarm systems which emit loud noises; that many of such devices do not
contain automatic shut-off systems and, because of the absence or
45.Editor's Note: Added at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 44-5 ADVERTISEMENTS, PAMPHLETS AND § 53-1

unavailability of the owner or operator of such devices, it is often difficult or
impossible to control, terminate or shut-off such devices thereby exposing
persons in the vicinity of such devices to loud noises for lengthy and
indefinite periods of time; that these conditions are contrary to the public
health, welfare and well-being of persons in the community; and that
uncontrolled emission of alarm signals for lengthy and indefinite periods
of time is not necessary to the legitimate purpose to be served by such
devices. The governing body further finds that the public safety and welfare
interests of the municipality will be furthered if such devices conform to
certain standards. The governing body further finds that the occurrence of
false alarms from the various types of alarm devices and the intentional
or unintentional misuse of such devices cause unnecessary response by
the Police Department thereby resulting in unnecessary expense and an
unproductive diversion of police personnel and equipment from their
normal public safety functions.
§ 53-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish regulations concerning the
operation and maintenance of certain alarm devices and systems within the
Township of the Borough of Verona and to provide penalties for the violation
of any of the provisions hereof.

related equipment. The term "false alarm" shall not include alarms created

Department equipment or activations caused by public utility interruptions
where such interruptions have been reported to the police or activations
caused by a natural disaster or activations caused by testing or repair of
an alarm system or device provided that the Police Department has been

Any connection of direct alarms to the police alarm console shall be of a
type inspected and approved by the contractor servicing the police alarm
console at the time of the installation of the direct alarm device. It shall
be the responsibility of the person causing the direct alarm device to
be installed to make arrangements with the approved contractor for the
payment of all connection fees and maintenance charges. The Township of
the Borough of Verona shall not be charged for alarm console connection
fees or maintenance charges. A schedule of connection fees and

E. All components of such equipment shall be maintained by the owner or
operator in good repair.
F. In addition to the registration requirements of this chapter, the owner
or operator of a dial alarm device shall pay an annual fee to the
Township of the Borough of Verona in the amount of twelve dollars
($12.) to offset the cost of the special telephone line or lines required by
dial alarm devices. Such annual fee shall be payable on the first day of
June for each calendar year. Fees for the installation of a dial alarm
device during the calendar year shall be prorated.
G. In the event that a person who owns or operates a dial alarm device
fails to comply with this section, the Chief of Police, or his designee,

equipment to Police Headquarters, including all damages arising out of or
as a result of any forced entry by police personnel into unattended premises
occurring during alarm response.
§ 53-10. When effective.
This chapter shall apply to alarm devices placed in service prior to or
subsequent to the effective date hereof; provided, however, that owners
or operators of existing alarm devices shall have thirty (30) days from
the effective date hereof to register such alarm devices with the Verona
Police Department in accordance with this chapter and one hundred twenty
(120) days from the effective date hereof to equip alarm devices having an

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 77-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry.
§ 77-2. Findings of fact.
§ 77-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of Verona are subject to periodic inundation
which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards,
disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of
the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and
general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
C. To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
§ 77-1 FLOOD CONTROL § 77-3
77:171
§ 77-4. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
H. To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.

appeal actions, including technical information, and report any
variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
(a) through (k) in § 77-15A(4) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 77-15 A(4), or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

Provisions for Flood Hazard Reduction
§ 77-16. General standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:
A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation,
collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include,
but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to
ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
B. Construction materials and methods.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood
damage.
(2) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood
damage.
C. Utilities.
(1) All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
(2) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharge from the systems into floodwaters;
(3) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding;
and
(4) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air-conditioning
equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
D. Subdivision proposals.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to
minimize flood damage;
§ 77-16 FLOOD CONTROL § 77-16
77:183
§ 77-17. Specific standards.
In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have
been provided as set forth in § 17-7, Basis for establishing the areas of
special flood hazard, or in § 17-14B, Use of other base flood data, the
following standards are required:
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to
reduce exposure to flood damage; and
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision
proposals and other proposed development which contain at least
50 lots or five acres (whichever is less).
E. Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial
improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that
are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in
an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall
be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs
for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following
minimum criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of
not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area
subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall
be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped
with screens, louvers, or other covering or devices, provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
A. Residential construction.
(1) New construction and substantial improvement of any residential
structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated
to or above base flood elevation;
(2) Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's DFIRM/FIRM
that all new construction and substantial improvement of any
residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as
high as the depth number specified in feet (at least two feet if no
depth number is specified). And require adequate drainage paths
around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away
from proposed structures.
B. Nonresidential construction. New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential
structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement,
§ 77-16 VERONA CODE § 77-17
77:184
elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or together with the
attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, shall:
(1) Require within any AO Zone on the municipality's DFIRM/FIRM
that all new construction and substantial improvement of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall
either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above
the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number
specified in feet (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
And require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes
to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures;
or
(2) Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is
watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of
water;
(3) Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and
(4) Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that
the design and methods of construction are in accordance with
accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable
provisions of this subsection. Such certification shall be provided to
the official as set forth in § 77-14C(2).
C. Manufactured homes.
(1) Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with
§ 77-16A(2).
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at or
above the base flood elevation.
D. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 77-7 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development, unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(2) If § 77-17D(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with Article V, Provisions for Flood
Hazard Reduction.
§ 77-17 FLOOD CONTROL § 77-17
77:185
(3) In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation
data has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
0.2 of a foot at any point.

Unfit Buildings111
§ 107-14. Inspection for unfitness.
The Public Officer, on his own or upon the filing of a petition by at least
five residents of the Township of Verona charging that a building is unfit for
human habitation or use, shall make an inspection of any building believed
to be unfit for human habitation or use and shall make a preliminary finding,
in accordance with the standards provided herein as to whether or not the
premises are unfit for human habitation or use, and, if so, he shall, except
where § 107-19 applies, thereupon serve a notice upon the owner, operator
or occupant, advising all such parties of the results of his inspection and the
basis for his determination.
§ 107-15. Basis for determination of unfitness.
In making a determination of whether a building is unfit for human
habitation or use, the Public Officer shall determine whether, by reason
of violations of this chapter existing in the building or on the premises,
continued occupancy of the building will not endanger and jeopardize the
health and safety of the occupants or persons in the vicinity of the premises,
and to that end he may consider, among other factors:
A. Whether the premises are so structurally defective that there is a risk of
collapse or of loose materials falling and injuring persons in and around
the building.
B. Whether, by reason of inadequate ventilation, there is a danger of
communicable diseases being contracted and spread in and among the
occupants or persons in the vicinity of the premises.
C. Whether, by reason of infestation or defective condition of plumbing or
the lack of maintenance of halls, floors, walls or other parts of the
premises, conditions exist which are conducive to the contracting and
spreading of diseases.
D. Whether, by reason of electrical wiring, conduits or equipment, heating
or cooking facilities or lack of proper means of egress, there is a danger
of fire or, in the case of fire, inadequate means of egress.
E. Whether premises are deficient in one or more essential utilities,
including public sewer, water supply or electricity.
F. Where premises were not designed or constructed for human
habitation, whether by reason of the same, occupancy constitutes an
unnecessary hazard to safety or health.

§ 107-14 PREVENTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE § 107-16
105:265
§ 107-16. Action by Public Officer.
After the making of an inspection as prescribed in § 107-14, the Public
Officer shall make a determination as to whether the building is unfit for
human habitation or use, and thereupon he shall make an order based on an
evaluation of health and safety factors in the use of the premises, as follows:
§ 107-17. Correction of violations; reinspection. [Amended
8-17-1981 by Ord. No. 6-81]
Where premises are ordered vacated, all doors to the exterior shall be
locked and first-story or basement and cellar windows barred or boarded to
prevent entry. Where an order is issued under § 107-18, it shall be served on
all persons affected thereby pursuant § 107-21E(1). When the conditions of
the violations complained of are corrected, the owner or occupant affected
A. That occupancy of all or part of the building shall be permitted for a
limited period of time not to exceed 30 days, upon the condition that all
violations recited in the order are corrected or abated within that time,
and, if not corrected or abated, the premises shall be vacated within 10
days thereafter;
B. That the building or any part thereof shall be ordered vacated within a
specified period not to exceed 30 days, be boarded up and signs or
notices that occupancy is prohibited shall be posted prominently at all
entrances of the building and that the order continue in effect until the
conditions are abated and the order revoked as provided herein. The
order may prohibit occupants from paying, and the owner and operator
from receiving, rent or other compensation for use and occupancy while
it remains in effect; or
C. That by reason of the complete state of disrepair and the
disproportionate investment required to restore the building to
habitable condition and the danger that the premises constitute, even
while vacant, a threat to the health and safety of persons on or near the
premises, the improvement of the building is impracticable, and
continuance of the building vacant constitutes a danger to the health,
safety and well-being of the neighborhood, whereupon the building is to
be ordered vacated and demolished within a period of time not to
exceed 60 days, unless the owner, after having the premises vacated,
consents, where no emergency exists, in writing to rehabilitate the
building so that it complies in all respects with this chapter within six
months and provides, if required by the Public Officer, a performance
bond guaranteeing that the work be done, or unless the owner, if the
Public Officer deems it feasible without jeopardizing public health and
safety, agrees with the Public Officer to put the premises up for sale on
terms, conditions and limitations which would provide a reasonable
expectancy of securing the rehabilitation of the building thereon within
a reasonable period of time and further that if such sale does not occur
within the time specified, the Public Officer may thereafter demolish
the building without further notice or proceedings.
§ 107-16 VERONA CODE § 107-17
105:266
thereby may request a reinspection which shall be provided upon the
payment of the reinspection fee provided for in Ch. A175, Fees. Based on
the reinspection, the Public Officer shall issue a further order which shall
either revoke the previous order and permit occupancy or state such further
conditions or time limits during which additional repairs or improvements
are to be made before occupancy is again permitted or order vacation and
demolition as in § 107-16. Upon compliance with the conditions contained
in any order, the Public Officer shall permit the signs to be removed and the
premises made available again for occupancy.
§ 107-18. Noncorrection of violations; premises declared nuisance;
court action.
Where the owner, operator or occupant fails to comply with any order
hereunder or to perform in accordance with any written commitment as
provided herein, or removes any notice posted pursuant hereto or any lock
or bar without the permission of the Public Officer, he shall be deemed
in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties provided herein.
In addition thereto, the Public Officer may take such steps as may be
necessary to compel vacation and boarding up of any premises and may
post signs prohibiting occupancy. Upon failure to comply with any such
order, the premises shall constitute a public nuisance, and the Public Officer
may take such further action under the criminal and civil laws of this state
through any court of competent jurisdiction as may be necessary to remove
or abate the nuisance.
§ 107-19. Emergency vacation of premises.
Where the Public Officer makes a preliminary finding that conditions on
the premises constitute an immediate and substantial threat to the safety
or health of occupants or persons in proximity to the premises, he may
order and direct that the premises be vacated immediately and that signs or
notices be posted prohibiting occupancy thereof and that the premises be
locked and boarded up as provided in § 107-17.

issuance of a summons and complaint by the Municipal Court. Where it
is ascertained that the owner does not reside on the premises, the last
known address shall be the address of the owner as shown in the office
of the Tax Collector. Where the premises are required to be registered
with the township or with the State of New Jersey or other
governmental authority and have been so registered, service may be
made upon the agent designated in such registration, and such service
shall constitute service upon the owner, operator or lessor of the
premises. Where the owner, operator or lessor has failed to register or
if the premises have been registered and the agent designated therein
cannot be found at the address given in the registration, the owner,
operator or lessor affected thereby may be served by posting a copy of
the summons and complaint upon the premises in a conspicuous place
which is as near as possible to the front entrance of such premises.
C. Service of notices. Any notice which may be required under this chapter
may be served in the same manner as provided in this chapter for the
service of a summons and complaint. In the case of an occupant, notice
may be posted on the door of the dwelling unit or rooming unit of such
occupant. The effective date of such notice shall be the date such notice
is delivered, in the case of personal service, or the date of mailing, in
the case of service by certified or regular mail.

including the making of inspections. [Amended 11-7-1979 by Ord.
No. 26-79]
B. Inspections: when inspections are to be made.
(1) Residential. All buildings and premises subject to this chapter are
subject to inspections from time to time by the enforcing officer of
the Township as permitted by law. At the time of such inspections,
all rooms in the building and all parts of the premises, except those
heretofore excluded, must be available and accessible for such
inspections, and the owner, operator and occupant are required to
provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such inspections.
Such inspections shall be made between 8:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.
unless one of the following conditions exists:
(a) The premises are not available during the foregoing hours for
inspections.
(b) There is reason to believe that violations are occurring on the
premises which can only be apprehended and proven by
inspections during other than the prescribed hours or which
require immediate inspection after being reported, such as
failure to supply heat.
(c) There is reason to believe that a violation exists of a character
which is an immediate threat to health or safety requiring
inspection and abatement without delay.
(d) All inspections as provided for herein shall be with the
permission of the owner of said premises or by a person duly
authorized by said owner to give such permission. In the event
that such permission is denied to the Public Officer upon
request, the provisions as hereinafter provided for shall be
complied with.
(2) Nonresidential. All buildings and premises subject to this chapter
are subject to inspection from time to time by the enforcing officer.
At the time of such inspections, all rooms and parts of the premises
must be available and accessible for such inspections, and the
owner and operator are required to provide the necessary
arrangements to facilitate such inspections. Such inspections shall
be made during regular open hours of the business occupying said
premises unless there is reason to believe a violation exists of a
character which is an immediate threat to health or safety
requiring inspection and abatement without delay.
C. Identification and conduct of inspectors. Inspectors shall be supplied
with official identification and shall exhibit such identification when
entering any dwelling unit, rooming unit or any part of any premises
§ 107-21 VERONA CODE § 107-21
105:270
subject to this chapter. Inspectors shall conduct themselves so as to
avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
D. Where entry by inspectors is refused.
(1) Penalties. Where the Public Officer or his agent is refused entry or
access or is otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner,
occupant or operator from conducting an inspection of the
premises, said Public Officer shall comply with and follow the
provisions as hereinafter provided for in such cases.
(2) Search warrant or access warrant. In addition to the provisions of
Subsection D(1) above, the Public Officer may, upon affidavit, apply
to the Judge of the Township of Verona for a search warrant setting
forth factually the actual conditions and circumstances that provide
a reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of this
chapter exists on the premises, and if the Judge is satisfied as to the
matter set forth in said affidavit, he shall authorize the issuance of
a search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of
the premises on which the nuisance or violation exists. Warrant for
access may be issued by the Judge upon affidavit of the Public
Officer establishing grounds therefor pursuant to § 107-27C.
E. Stay where dispossess action undertaken. Where a summons and
complaint have been issued under this chapter against an owner or
operator, the Municipal Judge may stay proceedings in Municipal Court
for such reasonable time as the owner or operator is unable to eliminate
the violation by reason of an inability to dispossess, evict or eject an
occupant who is the cause of the violation, provided that the owner or
operator is in good faith prosecuting an action to dispossess, evict or
eject such occupant in a court of competent jurisdiction. [Amended
8-17-1981 by Ord. No. 6-81; 5-4-1987 by Ord. No. 8-87]
F. Summary abatement in emergency. Where the violation or condition
existing on the premises is of such a nature as to constitute an
immediate threat to life and limb unless abated without delay, the
Public Officer may either abate the violation or condition immediately
or order the owner, operator or occupant to correct the violation or
condition within a period of time not to exceed three days, and upon
failure to do so, the Public Officer may abate the condition immediately
thereafter. [Amended 5-4-1987 by Ord. No. 8-87]
G. Cost of abatement to be a lien against premises. Where abatement of
any nuisance, as defined in this chapter, correction of a defect in any
premises or the maintenance of any premises in a proper condition so
as to conform to municipal ordinances or state law applicable thereto
requires the expenditure of any township moneys therefor, the Public
Officer shall present a report to the township governing body setting
forth the work proposed to be performed to abate or correct the
violation or condition, together with an estimate of the cost for such
work and a summary of the proceeding undertaken by the Public
§ 107-21 PREVENTION OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE § 107-21
105:271
§ 107-22. Violations and penalties.
Officer. The governing body may thereupon, by resolution, authorize
the abatement of the nuisance, correction of the defect or work
necessary to place the premises in compliance with township
ordinances and laws of the state. The Public Officer may thereafter
proceed to have work performed in accordance with said resolution at
the expense of the township but not to exceed that amount specified in
the resolution. Upon completion of necessary work, the Public Officer
shall submit a report of moneys expended and the cost to the township.
After a review of said report, the governing body shall approve said
expenses and costs, whereupon same shall become a lien against said
premises, collectible as provided by law. A copy of the resolution
approving said expenses and costs shall be certified by the governing
body and filed with the Township Tax Collector, who shall be
responsible for the collection thereon, and a copy of the resolution shall
be sent by certified mail to the owner at the address as shown on the
records of the Tax Collector. [Amended 5-4-1987 by Ord. No. 8-87]
H. Referral of violations. Any violation of any township ordinance or state
law discovered by a township employee in the course of performing his
duties shall be reported to the Public Officer, who shall refer the alleged
violation to the official or agency responsible for the enforcement of
such ordinance or state law. [Amended 5-4-1987 by Ord. No. 8-87]
I. Effect of notice on owner. For the purposes of enforcement of this
chapter, the service of a notice on an owner, whether or not the owner is
also the operator, shall constitute notice of violations set forth therein
until said violations are abated in conformity with this chapter and the
other applicable ordinances of the Township of Verona.
A. Violations and penalties. Any person who violates any of the provisions
of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to a fine of not
less than $100 and not more than $1,000, not to exceed $1,000, or
imprisonment in the county jail for a period not to exceed 90 days, or
both. Each violation shall constitute a separate offense. [Amended
8-17-1981 by Ord. No. 6-81; 5-4-1987 by Ord. No. 8-87]
B. Meaning of "each violation." Each violation of a section or subsection of
this chapter shall constitute a separate and distinct violation
independent of any other section or subsection or any order issued
pursuant to this chapter. Each day's failure to comply with any such
section or subsection shall constitute a separate violation.
C. Application to officers or agents. Where the defendant is other than a
natural person or persons, Subsections A and B above shall also apply
to any agent, superintendent, officer, member or partner who shall
alone or with others have charge, care or control of the premises.
§ 107-21 VERONA CODE § 107-23
105:272
§ 107-23. Existing violations not discharged.
The repeal of any provisions of any other ordinances by this chapter shall
not affect any action for prosecution or abatement under any such
ordinance or any notice, complaint or order issued by any officer or agency
of the Township prior to the effective date hereof or concerning which any
prosecution or other steps of enforcement have been taken or are being
taking within any administrative agency or in the Municipal Court113 for
enforcement thereof.
§ 107-24. Powers and duties of Public Officer.
A. Power to vary or modify provisions of this chapter. The Public Officer
shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement of the requirements
of this chapter upon written application therefor by an owner, operator
or occupant, after making determination that:
(1) Any variation or modification of structure or use approved by the
Public Officer will not in any material way alter the standards of
this chapter and cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety of
occupants of the premises or the health, safety or welfare of the
occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of the neighborhood;
and
(2) Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, operator or occupant because it would
compel expenditures on the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare that
might be derived therefrom.
(3) The strict enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would
require the installation of repairs and improvements estimated to
exceed $300 in cost, and the premises subject to this chapter are
contemplated by a public agency having the power of eminent
domain and there is a reasonable likelihood that said premises will
be acquired within a period of two years; provided, however, that
any waiver of the provisions of this chapter shall be canceled and
the Public Officer shall strictly enforce the chapter if it shall be
ascertained subsequent to the granting of the waiver that the
premises are in fact not to be acquired for any public use or
purpose; or
(4) Strict compliance with this chapter require substantial structural
changes to the premises, and the nonconformity is of a technical
and insubstantial character or there is an alternative means
satisfactory to the Public Officer to be used, which will eliminate
violations of this chapter constituting hazards to the health, safety

Officer or by action of any court, a written record thereof stating the
name of the applicant, the address of the premises, the variation or
modification approved, date of approval and the reasons therefor,
satisfying the provisions contained herein, shall be prepared by the
Public Officer and filed both under the section or sections of this
chapter to which the variation of modification applies and under the
address of the premises, and such files shall be available for public
inspection in the office of the Public Officer during regular business
hours.
C. Annual review of chapter provisions and operations. The Public Officer
shall, in the month of December of each year, review with the Fire
Chief, Health Officer, Township Engineer and Township Counsel the
procedure and operation of this chapter, and report to the Mayor and
Township Council on or before January 1:
(1) Any recommended amendment, addition or modification or
provisions of this chapter consonant with the field experience of the
personnel charged with enforcement.
(2) A summary of the enforcement experience indicating the number of
violations abated, number of cases processed in the Municipal
Court, number of inspections made and such other and further
pertinent information as will provide the Mayor and Township
Council with an annual account of progress in securing the
standards required by this chapter.
(3) Any further recommendation as to how the chapter and the
procedure and operations thereunder can be improved.
A. Application for inspection. Whenever an owner, operator, occupant,
prospective purchaser, mortgagee or prospective occupant shall apply
to the Public Officer for an inspection in order to ascertain if any section
of this chapter has been violated, the Public Officer shall, upon payment
of the fee hereunder stated, cause an inspection to be made of the
premises and issue an informal certificate or report of the inspection to
the applicant, indicating therein any violations of this chapter on the
premises. The applicant for such inspection shall state in writing his full
name, residence and the reasons and basis for which the inspection is
requested. The Public Officer may deny the application for failure to
comply with this requirement.
B. Application for status report. Where, in lieu of an inspection, an owner,

order on any violation then pending shall be sent to the applicant.
C. Significance and scope of inspection or status report. No inspection
report issued under Subsection A above or status report under
Subsection B shall be construed as providing a defense against any
violation of this chapter or any other ordinance of the Township which
may be discovered thereafter, whether or not the condition or violation
existed at the time of any such inspection or status report. The
inspection or status report is provided as a convenience to the public
and shall not constitute a limitation on the full enforcement of this
chapter. The inspection or status report shall include only such matters
as are embraced in this chapter.

A. Who may apply. Where any owner, operator or occupant is required to
make repairs or otherwise improve property and is unable to comply
with this chapter without having right of access to the building or
premises through or across adjoining premises not owned by him or
under his control, and where right of access has been refused the
owner, operator or occupant, or where the owner or person responsible
for granting permission cannot be found or located, then, upon filing of
an affidavit setting forth the facts with the Public Officer, the Public
Officer shall serve a five-day written notice in accordance with the
provisions for service contained in § 107-21E(1) upon the owner,
operator or occupant of any adjoining premises affected by the
application.
B. Issuance of certificate; conditions. If the Public Officer determines that
access is necessary to accomplish or complete repairs or improvements
necessary for compliance with this chapter, then the Public Officer shall
issue a certificate of necessity setting forth therein the person or
persons to whom the certificate shall apply, such conditions as shall be

115. Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 46:8B-1 et seq.
§ 112-1 VERONA CODE § 112-2
112:282
(1) Any landlord seeking an increase in rent shall notify the tenant in
accordance with § 112-11. Said notice shall include a copy of
calculations involved in computing the increase, including the
monthly base rental amount (exclusive of any and all surcharges,
service fees, etc.), the allowable percentage increase and the
allowable rent increase amount. This notification shall be given not
less than thirty (30) days prior to the effective date of such rental
increase.
(2) Any landlord seeking an increase in rent from a tenant shall include
within the notice to tenants required under Subsection (1) of this
subsection a statement that the landlord has obtained an annual
certification that the exterior building of each dwelling leased is in
substantial compliance with the Property Maintenance Code of the
Township of the Borough of Verona.116 Prior to the implementation
of any rental increase under this section, the landlord shall obtain
such certification from the Property Maintenance Department or
Construction Code Official of the Township of the Borough of
Verona. "Substantial compliance" means that the exterior of the
dwelling is free from all health, safety and fire hazards as well as
ninety percent (90%) qualitatively free from all other violations of
the Township of the Borough of Verona Property Maintenance
Code.
D. In the event that an individual unit, housing space or dwelling is not
properly maintained by the landlord in accordance with any and all
provisions of the Township of the Borough of Verona Property
Maintenance Code, the tenant may appeal any rental increase sought
by the landlord so long as such appeal is made to the Rent Control
Board within thirty (30) days after notice is given by the landlord to the
tenants, as required under Subsection C(1) of this section. The Rent
Control Board, upon receiving notice of such appeal by any tenant, shall
request the Property Maintenance Department or Construction Code
Official to conduct an inspection of the individual unit, housing space or
dwelling to determine whether such individual unit, housing space or
dwelling is in substantial compliance with the Property Maintenance
Code of the Township of the Borough of Verona. "Substantial
compliance" means that the individual unit, housing space or dwelling
which is the subject of the tenant's appeal under this subsection is free
from all heat, hot water, elevator and all health, safety and fire hazards
as well as ninety percent (90%) qualitatively free from all other
violations of the Township of the Borough of Verona Property
Maintenance Code. If the Property Maintenance Department or
Construction Code Official determines that the individual unit, housing
space or dwelling which is the subject of the tenant's appeal under this
subsection is not in substantial compliance, as that term is defined
hereunder, the rental increase sought by the landlord shall be
prohibited until such time as the required maintenance and/or

§ 112-3. Vacancy increase. [Amended 10-7-1985 by Ord. No.]
renovation is completed by the landlord in the manner and to the extent
prescribed and approved by the Property Maintenance Department
or the Construction Code Official. If the Property Maintenance
Department or Construction Code Official determines that the
individual unit, housing space or dwelling which is the subject of the
tenant's appeal under this subsection is in substantial compliance, as
that term is defined hereunder, the increase sought by the landlord
shall be due and payable by the tenant to the landlord as of the date
when such increase was to have taken effect as stated in the notice from
the landlord pursuant to § 112-2C(1) of this chapter. In the event that a
tenant appeals a rental increase on the grounds that his housing space
fails to comply with the Property Maintenance Code of the Township of
the Borough of Verona, then at the time said appeal is filed, the tenant
shall specify three (3) days which shall be between Monday and Friday,
10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m., when his housing space will be available for
inspection. The aforesaid dates shall be within ten (10) days of the date
that the appeal is filed. In the event that the tenant fails to specify said
dates or, if having specified said dates, fails to make his housing space
available for inspection, the housing space shall be considered to be in
compliance with the Property Maintenance Code.
A. Notwithstanding any limitations upon permissible rent increases under
any other provisions of this chapter, upon the voluntary, uncoerced
vacation of any apartment, rent increases for which are controlled in
this chapter, the landlord shall have the right to fix the rent for such
vacated apartment at such sum as he deems appropriate, except that
the maximum rent which the landlord may fix for such vacated
apartment shall be equal to the previous rent for such vacated
apartment increased by fifteen percent (15%) or the highest rent
received by the landlord for a comparable apartment in the same
building complex at the time such rent is fixed, whichever sum is
higher.
B. Qualification for increase; hearing.
(1) In order for a landlord to qualify for the vacancy decontrol rent
increase, the landlord shall first be required to file with the Rent
Leveling Board a written statement, signed by the vacating tenant,
certifying to the Board that the landlord has not, in any way,
harassed or pressured the tenant into vacating the housing space
unit and that the vacation of such unit was a voluntary act on the
part of the tenant. Such noncoercion certification shall not be
required in order for the landlord to qualify for the vacancy
decontrol increase, if:
(a) The increase does not exceed the total of all permissible
increases authorized by any other provisions of this chapter;
§ 112-2 VERONA CODE § 112-3
112:284
(b) The tenant has moved from the unit without notice to the
landlord;
(c) The unit has been vacated pursuant to a judicially mandated
eviction; or
(d) The tenant has refused to sign such certification and, upon
appeal by the landlord, the Rent Leveling Board has found that
such refusal was unwarranted and that there was in fact no
coercion exerted by the landlord upon the vacating tenant.
(2) A hearing pursuant to Subsection B(1)(d) above shall be held
before the Rent Leveling Board upon at least seven (7) days notice
to the public and the vacating tenant. The decontrol provision of
this section shall only apply to dwelling units which are physically
vacated subsequent to the effective date of this section.
C. Upon vacation of any apartment hereafter, the landlord shall file a
statement with the Rent Leveling Board, certifying to the Board:
(1) The apartment and building numbers of such dwelling unit.
(2) The rent paid by the vacating tenant.
(3) The maximum rent increase which would be permissible under the
other provisions of this chapter.
(4) The number of days such apartment remains vacant.
(5) The rent agreed to by the new tenant for such apartment.
(6) That the vacation of such apartment was the voluntary act of the
vacating tenant and that such vacation was not the result of
landlord harassment or pressure upon such vacating tenant.
(7) That the vacant apartment has been inspected by the Code
Enforcement Official for compliance with the Property
Maintenance Code117 and found to be in substantial compliance.
[The fee for such inspection is twenty-five dollars ($25.).]
D. Anti-harassment; complaint procedure. In the event that a tenant
believes that he or she is being harassed by actions or omissions of his
or her landlord in any way which might be calculated to induce the
tenant to vacate his or her apartment, such tenant may make complaint
to the Verona Construction Code Official. If the Code Official is not able
within his lawful powers to take action to cause the landlord to cease
the harassment complained of, or if the Code Official concludes that the
landlord's action or omission complained of does not constitute
harassment, the tenant shall have the right to appeal directly to the
Rent Control Board within thirty (30) days after the Code Official has
communicated such findings to the complaining tenant. If the Code

§ 112-3 RENT CONTROL § 112-3
112:285
§ 112-4. Hardship appeal. [Amended 10-7-1985 by Ord. No. 16-85]
Enforcement Official concludes that the complaint does constitute
harassment, the landlord shall have the right to appeal to the Rent
Board within thirty (30) days after the Code Official has communicated
such findings to the landlord. Notice of the complaint of the tenant
should be given to the landlord in question and a hearing date should
be set when both the tenant and landlord or proper representatives
of each appear before the Board about the complaint. If the Board
determines that the tenant's complaint has merit, the landlord will be
immediately notified in writing that until the harassment complained
of is eliminated, said landlord shall be prohibited from increasing the
rent for that apartment and that the amount of time during which the
harassment continues after the date of the landlord's receipt of notice
from the Board shall be the amount of time which is pro rata deducted
from any rent increase that the landlord may next request. The Board
will assume that the landlord will comply with its directives and will
not prohibit rent increases unless a tenant complains and proves to the
Board's satisfaction that the landlord has not complied with the Board's
directive about harassment.
E. The Rent Leveling Board shall submit monthly reports to the governing
body summarizing the number of apartments vacated during each such
month and the differences, if any, between the permissible rent
increases under the other provisions of this chapter as compared to the
increases in rent due to the application of this section. Such monthly
reports shall also include the statement of the number of complaints
received by the Board with respect to alleged coercion by landlords for
the purpose of forcing tenants to vacate apartments.
A. In the event that a landlord is not earning a just and reasonable return
on his investment, he may appeal to the Board for increased rental. The
landlord must furnish the Board with a full and complete statement of
all income, names of tenants, details of the apartments rented, the
amount of rent, together with an operating schedule of the costs of
operating and maintaining the premises, as well as all other supporting
documentation which the Board may reasonably request in connection
with the appeal. The Board shall make a determination as to whether a
hardship exists and whether such hardship warrants an increase in
rent. In any hardship application, the Board may grant a hardship rent
increase if the landlord has not received rent increases which equal his
increases in operating expenses in order to maintain a fair net
operating income as defined in this chapter. "Net operating income"
means the amount by which the annual income exceeds annual
operating expenses. "Annual income" means the legal monthly, weekly
or other period rent for all units in the building, both residential and
commercial, on the date that the landlord's appeal is filed, together
with any other income earned from the operation of the building during
the period of twelve (12) consecutive months immediately preceding
the date of the landlord's appeal. In any case where a rental unit is
§ 112-3 VERONA CODE § 112-4
112:286
§ 112-5. Surcharge for improvements; notification.
occupied in whole or in part rent free, the full rental value shall be
considered the legal rent. "Annual operating expenses" means all real
estate taxes and operating costs necessary to the operation and
maintenance of the building but excluding depreciation, mortgage
interest and amortization properly allocated to the twelve-month period
immediately preceding the date on which the appeal is filed.
B. In any hardship application, the Board shall determine the
reasonableness of the landlord's figures and make adjustments
accordingly. Prior to any such appeal to the Board, a landlord shall post
in the lobby of each building, or if no lobby is present, in a conspicuous
place in and about the premises, a notice of such appeal, setting forth
the basis for such appeal. Said notice shall be posted for at least ten
(10) days prior to the date fixed for hearing and appeal; and also, the
landlord shall serve or cause to be served upon the tenants a notice of
the appeal as provided in § 112-11 below at least ten (10) days prior to
the date fixed for hearing and appeal. The Board shall hear the appeal
and, if a determination is made that a hardship does exist which
warrants a rent increase, the Board shall fix the amount of said
increase, which sum shall be charged to the tenants in monthly
installments pro rata, based upon square footage of dwelling space
occupied.
A. Surcharge. The landlord may seek a surcharge for a capital or service
improvement. He must first secure the approval of the Board before
commencing the capital or service improvement project so that the
Board may make a determination of said improvement or service to
distinguish it from a repair or replacement to the premises. In making
such a determination, the Board shall consider a capital or service
improvement as that which enhances the value of the dwelling or
housing space but shall not be bound by the Internal Revenue Service
definition. In any event, the tenant shall not be liable for a capital or
service improvement surcharge exceeding the cost of the capital or
service improvement to the landlord per square feet occupied by the
tenant. The surcharge shall be paid in equal monthly installments for a
period no shorter than the Internal Revenue Service depreciation
period claimed for said capital or service improvement and shall not
exceed ten percent (10%) of the tenant's base monthly rental.
B. Notification of surcharge assessment to tenant. Prior to any appeal to
the Board for surcharge for a capital or service improvement, the
landlord must post in the lobby of each building, or if no lobby is
present, in a conspicuous place in and about the premises, a notice of
said appeal. Said notice must be posted for at least ten (10) days prior
to the date fixed for hearing the appeal, and, also, the landlord must
serve or cause to be served upon the tenants a notice of the appeal as
provided in § 112-11 below at least ten (10) days prior to the date fixed
for hearing the appeal. The notice to the tenant must include the total

submitted and approved by the Planning Board, and no certificate of
occupancy shall be given unless all construction and development
conform to the plans as approved by the Planning Board.
B. Simultaneous review. The Planning Board shall have the power to
review and approve or deny conditional uses or subdivisions
simultaneously with review for site plan approval without the developer
being required to make further application to the Planning Board or the
Planning Board being required to hold further hearings. The longest
time period for action by the Planning Board, whether it be for
subdivision, conditional use or site plan approval, shall apply. Whenever

contained in § 118-17 of this chapter are substantially satisfied and
that no further determination is required.
(2) Site plan approval shall not be required for any detached one- or
two-dwelling-unit buildings or any uses accessory thereto, such as
a private garage or storage shed incidental to residential uses, but
this shall not limit the requirements for submission and approval of
subdivision plats as otherwise required by Township ordinances.121

the cost of the improvement. In the event that other governmental
agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be
installed or the improvements are covered by performance or
maintenance guaranty to another governmental agency, no
performance or maintenance guaranty, as the case may be, shall be
required for such utilities or improvements.
B. The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the
Township Council by resolution when portions of the improvements
have been certified by the Township Engineer to have been completed.
The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the
performance guaranty has been provided may be extended by the
Township Council by resolution.
C. If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if
any, shall be liable thereon to the Township for the reasonable cost of
the improvements not completed or corrected, and the Township may
either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof complete
such improvements.
D. When all of the required improvements have been completed, the
obligor shall notify the Township Council in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Township Clerk, of the completion of said
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Township Engineer.
Thereupon the Township Engineer shall inspect all of the improvements
and shall file a detailed report, in writing, with the Township Council,
indicating either approval, partial approval or rejection of the
improvements with a statement of reasons for any rejection. If partial
approval is indicated, the cost of the improvements rejected shall be set
forth.
E. The Township Council shall either approve, partially approve or reject
the improvements on the basis of the report of the Township Engineer
and shall notify the obligor in writing, by certified mail, of the contents
of said report and the action of the Township Council with relation
thereto not later than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the
obligor of the completion of the improvements. Where partial approval

116:307
§ 118-12. Off-tract improvements.
is granted, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to
its performance guaranty, except for that portion adequately sufficient
to secure provision of the improvements not yet approved. Failure
of the Township Council to send or provide such notification to the
obligor within 65 days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the
improvements and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from
all liability, pursuant to such performance guaranty.
F. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the Township
Council may require the obligor to complete such improvements and,
upon completion, the same procedure of notification as set forth in this
section shall be followed.
G. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
Township Council or the Township Engineer.
H. The obligor shall reimburse the Township for all reasonable inspection
fees paid for the foregoing inspection of improvements.
I. Prior to final acceptance of the improvements, the applicant shall file
with the Township Engineer and Construction Code Official as-built
drawings prepared by the applicant's engineer and/or architect
indicating any approved changes from the final plat plan.
A. As a condition for approval of a site plan, a developer may be required
by the Planning Board to pay his pro rata share of the cost of providing
only reasonable and necessary street improvements and water,
sewerage and drainage facilities, and easements therefor, located
outside the property limits of the development but necessitated or
required by construction or improvements within such development.
B. Requirements for providing off-tract improvements shall be based on
the circulation and utility service plan elements of the Township Master
Plan. The pro rata amount of the cost of such facilities that shall be
home by each developer or owner within a related and common area,
shall be determined by the Planning Board in accordance with the
following standards:
(1) Street improvements. The developer's share shall be based on the
average daily traffic generated by the proposed development, as a
proportion of total estimated average daily traffic on the street
based on complete development under existing zoning.
(2) Water, sewer and drainage improvements. The developer's share
shall be based on capacity required by the development in question
as a proportion of total capacity for the service area in which the
development is located.

§ 118-13. Reservation of public areas.
§ 118-14. Findings of fact by Planning Board.
Prior to site plan approval for a planned development, the Planning Board
shall find the following facts and conclusions:
C. Where a developer pays the amount determined as his pro rata share
under protest, he shall institute legal action within one (1) year of such
payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to
the fairness and reasonableness of such amount.
A. General requirements.
(1) If the Master Plan or the Official Map provides for the reservation
of designated streets, public drainageways, flood control basins or
public areas within the proposed development before approving a
site plan, the Planning Board may require that such streets, ways,
basins or areas be shown on the site plan in locations and sizes
suitable to their intended uses. The Planning Board may reserve
the location and extent of such streets, ways, basins or areas shown
on the plat for a period of one year after the approval of the final
plat or within such further time as may be agreed to by the
applicant.
(2) Unless during such period or extension thereof the Township shall
have entered into a contract to purchase or institute condemnation
proceedings according to law for the fee or a lesser interest in the
land comprising such streets, ways, basins or areas, the applicant
shall not be bound by such reservations shown on the plat and may
proceed to use such and for private use in accordance with
applicable development regulations.
B. Applicability. The provisions of this section shall not apply to streets and
roads, flood control basins or public drainageways necessitated by the
subdivision or land development and required for final approval.
C. Compensation. The applicant shall be entitled to just compensation for
actual loss found to be caused by such temporary reservation and
deprivation of use. In such instance, unless a lesser amount has
previously been mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of an option to purchase the land
reserved for the period of reservation, provided that determination of
such fair market value shall include but not be limited to consideration
of the real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and
prorated for the period of reservation. The applicant shall be
compensated for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering or
other professional services incurred in connection with obtaining site
plan approval caused by the reservation.

Board of Adjustment is reviewing an application for approval of a
variance pursuant to Section 57d of Chapter 291 of the Laws of New
Jersey of 1975123 and appropriate sections of the Zoning Ordinance of
the Township of Verona. All requirements of this chapter with the
exception of time period for approval shall apply to the site plan
application and Board of Adjustment when acting as the reviewing
board for a site plan application.
B. Time period for approval. Whenever an application for development
requests relief pursuant to Subsection A of this section, the Board of
Adjustment shall grant or deny approval of the application within one
hundred twenty (120) days after submission by an applicant of a
complete application to the Secretary of the Board of Adjustment or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Failure of the Board of Adjustment to act within the period prescribed
shall constitute approval of the application, and a certificate of the

§ 123-6. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 123-7.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that provide for disturbance of
land of greater that one or more acres of land that require
preliminary or final site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Township of Verona or by the County of Essex.
D. Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act
or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of
this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law except

A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 123-9. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
(2) The standards in this article apply only to new major development
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new
major development to the extent the alternative design and
performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater
management plan or water quality management plan adopted in
accordance with Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 123-15.
§ 123-7 SOIL REMOVAL § 123-9

muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of § 123-9F and G.
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of § 123-9F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of
an existing public roadway or railroad; or the construction or
enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following
conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 123-9F and G to the maximum
extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 123-9F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
§ 123-9F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 123-9 F and
G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
§ 123-9 VERONA CODE § 123-9
121:334
management strategies set forth at Subsection E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental,
or safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into
the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from
preconstruction to postconstruction. "Time of concentration" is
defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
(f) Minimize soil compaction;
(g) Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages
retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the
use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
(h) Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy Subsection E(3) below;
[2] Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
§ 123-9 SOIL REMOVAL § 123-9
121:335
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 123-9E(2)(i)[2] above shall
comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and
floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this
paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris,
trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. For
exemptions to this standard see § 123-9E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under the grate: the New Jersey
Department of Transportation (NJDOT) bicycle safe grate,
which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle
Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or a different grate, if each individual
clear space in that grate has an area of no more than seven
square inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches across the
smallest dimension. Examples of grates subject to this
standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion (noncurb-
opening portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm
sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open
channels, and stormwater basin floors.
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater
than two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 123-9G(1) are conveyed through any device
(e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
§ 123-9 VERONA CODE § 123-9
121:336
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 123-9G(1);
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register-listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 123-9F and G
shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the Essex County Clerk's office,
or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures that
measure or an equivalent management measure approved by the
reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 123-12, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 123-9, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
§ 123-9 SOIL REMOVAL § 123-9
121:337
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types or stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly and indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
§ 123-9 VERONA CODE § 123-9
121:338
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 123-9, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten-, and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten-, and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten-, and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply to the postconstruction stormwater
runoff that is attributable to the portion of the site on
which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 123-7 shall be submitted to the
appropriate Huson-Essex Soil Conservation District for review and
approval in accordance with the requirements of this section and
any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, agricultural development means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
§ 123-9 SOIL REMOVAL § 123-9
121:339
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the developed site,
expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
§ 123-9 VERONA CODE § 123-9
121:340
address identified in § 123-12, or found on the Department's Web
site at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources
of technical guidance are listed in § 123-12. TSS reduction shall
be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table
2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate of method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A+B-(AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2
TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90
Extended detention basin 40-60
Infiltration structure 80
Manufactured treatment device See § 123-11C
Sand filter 80
Vegetative filter strip 60-80
Wet pond 50-90
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage system, the eightypercent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless
the runoff from the subareas converge on one site, in which case
the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using
a weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
§ 123-9 SOIL REMOVAL § 123-9
121:341
§ 123-10. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 123-9F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practice Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 123-12.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficient and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NCRS methodology at § 123-10A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 123-10A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient
or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if land use
type is cultivation).
§ 123-9 VERONA CODE § 123-10
121:342
§ 123-11. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NCRS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,

water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 123-13D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Land Subdivision
Ordinance of the Borough of Verona."
§ 127-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter shall be to provide rules, regulations and
standards to guide land subdivision in the Borough of Verona in order
to promote the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare of
the borough. It shall be administered to ensure the orderly growth and
development, the conservation, protection and proper use of land and

§ 127-3. Administration.
A. Planning Board.
(1) The approval provisions of this chapter shall be administered by
the Planning Board of the Borough of Verona, in accordance with
Section 28 of Chapter 291 of the Laws of the 1975, N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq.
(2) The Chairman of the Planning Board, with the approval of the
Board, is hereby empowered to appoint a Subdivision Committee
consisting of three (3) members of the Planning Board. Said
Committee shall have the power and duty of classifying any sketch
plat as a minor subdivision if it meets with the conditions set forth
in the definition of a minor subdivision and if said Committee shall
find, unanimously, that there exists no cause for review by the
entire Board or for unfavorable action. In such event, the finding of
said Committee shall be deemed favorable referral by the Board,
and the procedure set forth in § 127-6A shall be followed.
B. Zoning Board of Adjustment.
§ 125-51 VERONA CODE § 127-3
127:370
§ 127-4. Interpretation; variance.
These rules, regulations and standards shall be considered the minimum
requirements for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the Borough of Verona. Any action taken by the Planning
Board under the terms of this chapter shall give primary consideration to
the above-mentioned matters and to the welfare of the entire community.
However, if the subdivider or his agent can clearly demonstrate that,
because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his land, the literal
enforcement of one (1) or more of these regulations is impracticable or
will exact undue hardship, the Planning Board may permit such variance or
variances as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent
of the rules, regulations and standards established by this chapter.
§ 127-5. Definitions and word usage.
(1) The Board of Adjustment shall have the power to grant to the same
extent and subject to the same restrictions as the Planning Board
subdivision approval pursuant to Article 6 of Chapter 291 of the
Laws of 1975148 whenever the Board of Adjustment is reviewing an
application for approval of a variance pursuant to Subsection 57d
of Article 9 of Chapter 291 of the Laws of 1975.149
(2) Whenever an application for development requests relief pursuant
to Subsection B(1) above, the Board of Adjustment shall grant or
deny approval of the application within one hundred twenty (120)
days after submission by a developer of a complete application to
the Borough Clerk or within such further time as may be consented
to by the applicant. Failure of the Board of Adjustment to act within
the period prescribed shall constitute approval of the application
and a certificate of the Borough Clerk as to the failure of the Board
of Adjustment to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and
it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other
evidence of approval herein required and shall be so accepted by
the county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision plats.
(3) Whenever review or approval of the application by the County
Planning Board is required by Section 5 of P.L. 1968, c. 285
(N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3), the Municipal Board of Adjustment shall
condition any approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a
favorable report on the application by the County Planning Board
or approval by the County Planning Board by its failure to report
thereon within the required time.
(4) An application under this section may be referred to any
appropriate person or agency, including the Planning Board, for its
report, provided that such reference shall not extend the period of
time within which the Board of Adjustment shall act.

the Subdivision Committee by a majority vote of all of its members.

Board may accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Act,

layout of improvements proposed by the developer that have been
the subject of a hearing, an amended application shall be submitted
and proceeded upon, as in the case of the original application for
development.
(8) If the Planning Board acts favorably on a preliminary plat, the
Chairman of the Planning Board shall affix his signature to the plat
with a notation that it has received preliminary approval and is
returned to the subdivider for compliance with final approval
requirements.

the final plat shall have incorporated all changes or modifications
required by the Planning Board.
(3) The final plat shall be accompanied by a statement by the Borough
Engineer that he is in receipt of a map showing all utilities in exact
location and elevation, identifying those portions already installed

shall be on the form accepted by the Mayor and Council of
the Borough of Verona and on file and obtainable from the

memorandum of agreement shall be deemed to be a part of
this chapter.
(4) The Planning Board shall grant final approval if the detailed
drawings, specifications and estimates of the application for final
approval conform to the standards established by ordinance for
final approval, the conditions of preliminary approval and, in the
case of a major subdivision, the standards prescribed by the Map
Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c. 141 (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), provided
that, in the case of a planned unit development, the Planning Board
may permit minimal deviations from the conditions of preliminary
approval necessitated by change of conditions beyond the control
of the developer since the date of preliminary approval without the
developer being required to submit another application for
development for preliminary approval.
(5) Final approval shall be granted or denied within forty-five (45) days
after submission of a complete application to the Borough Clerk or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Failure of the Planning Board to act within the period prescribed
shall constitute final approval, and a certificate of the Borough
Clerk as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall be issued
on request of the applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the
written endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required
and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for
purposes of filing subdivision plats.
(6) Whenever review or approval of the application by the County
Planning Board is required by Section 5 of P.L. 1968, c. 285
(N.J.S.A. 40:27-6.3), the Planning Board shall condition any
approval that it grants upon timely receipt of a favorable report on
the application by the Essex County Planning Board or approval by
the Essex County Planning Board by its failure to report thereon
within the required time period.
(7) Upon final approval, copies of the final plat shall be filed by the

recording officer. The Planning Board may, for good cause shown,
extend the period for recording for an additional period not to
exceed one hundred ninety (190) days from the date of the signing

of the Laws of 1975 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.). The signatures of
the Chairman and Secretary of the Planning Board shall not be
affixed until the developer has posted the guaranties required
pursuant to § 127-8 of this chapter.
(10) The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval
first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer
pursuant to Subsection B(10) of this section, whether conditionally
or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two (2) years
after the date of final approval, provided that, in the case of a major
subdivision, the rights conferred by this section shall expire if the
plat has not been duly recorded within the time period provided in
this section. If the developer has followed the standards prescribed
for final approval and has duly recorded the plat as required, the
Planning Board may extend such period of protection for
extensions of one (1) year, but not to exceed three (3) extensions.
Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, the granting
of final approval terminates the time period of preliminary approval
pursuant to Subsection B(10) of this section for the section granted
final approval.
E. Exception in application of subdivision regulations.
(1) The Planning Board, when acting upon applications for preliminary
or minor subdivision approval, shall have the power to grant such
exceptions from the requirements for subdivision approval as may
be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the
provisions for subdivision review and approval of this chapter, if the
§ 127-6 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 127-6
127:381
literal enforcement of one (1) or more provisions of this chapter
is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar
conditions pertaining to the land in question.
(2) The Planning Board shall have the power to review and approve or
deny conditional uses or site plans simultaneously with review for
subdivision approval without the developer's being required to
make further application to the Planning Board or the Planning
Board's being required to hold further hearings. The longest time
period for action by the Planning Board, whether it be for
subdivision, conditional use or site plan approval, shall apply.
Whenever approval of a conditional use is requested by the
developer pursuant to this subsection, notice of the hearing on the
plat shall include reference to the request for such conditional use.
F. Appeal procedure.
(1) Any interested party may appeal to the governing body any final
decision of the Zoning Board of Adjustment or Planning Board.
Such appeal shall be made within ten (10) days of the date of
publication of such final decisions pursuant to Subsection D of this
section. The appeal to the governing body shall be made by serving
the Borough Clerk in person or by certified mail with a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds thereof and the name and address of
the appellant and name and address of his attorney, if represented.
Such appeal shall be decided by the governing body only upon the
record established before the Planning Board or Board of
Adjustment.
(2) Notice of the meeting to review the record below shall be given by
the governing body by personal service or certified mail to the
appellant, to the applicant and to the Board from which the appeal
is taken at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the meeting. The
parties may submit oral and written argument on the record at
such meeting, and the governing body shall provide for verbatim
recording and transcripts of such meeting.
(3) The governing body shall conclude a review of the record below not
later than forty-five (45) days from the date of receipt of the
transcript of the hearing unless the appellant consents in writing to
an extension of such period. The appellant shall arrange for a
transcript for use by the governing body. Failure of the governing
body to hold a hearing and conclude a review of the record below
and to render a decision within such specified period, without such
written consent of the appellant, shall constitute a decision
affirming the action of the Board.
(4) The governing body may reverse, remand or affirm, wholly or in
part, or may modify the final decision of the Planning Board or
Board of Adjustment, as the case may be.
§ 127-6 VERONA CODE § 127-6
127:382
§ 127-7. Plat details.
(5) The affirmative vote of a majority of the full authorized membership
of the governing body shall be necessary to reverse, remand or
modify any final action of either Board.
(6) An appeal to the governing body shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action in respect to which the decision appealed
from was made unless the Board from whose action the appeal is
taken certifies to the governing body, after the notice of appeal
shall have been filed with such Board, that, by reasons of facts
stated in the certificate, a stay would, in its opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall
not be stayed other than by an order of the Superior Court on
application upon notice to the Board from whom the appeal is taken
and on good cause shown.
(7) The governing body shall mail a copy of the decision to the
appellant or, if represented, then to this attorney without separate
charge and for a reasonable charge to any interested party who has
requested it, not later than ten (10) days after the date of the
decision. A brief notice of the decision shall be published in the
official newspaper of the borough. Such publication shall be
arranged by the Borough Clerk, and the Borough Council may
make a reasonable charge for its publication. The period of time in
which an appeal to a court of competent jurisdiction may be made
shall run from the first publication, whether arranged by the
municipality or the application.
(8) Nothing in this section shall be construed to restrict the right of
any party to obtain a review by any court of competent jurisdiction
according to law.

(1) As a condition of final site plan approval, the Planning Board may
require and shall accept in accordance with the standards adopted
by this chapter for the purpose of assuring the installation and
maintenance of on-tract improvements:
(a) The furnishing of a performance guaranty in favor of the
municipality in an amount not to exceed one hundred twenty
percent (120%) of the cost of installation for improvements it
may deem necessary or appropriate, including streets,
grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, streetlighting,
shade trees, surveyors' monuments, as shown on the final map
and required by the Map Filing Law, P.L. 1960, c. 141 (N.J.S.A.
46:23-9.9 et seq.), water mains, culverts, storm sewers,
sanitary sewers or other means of sewage disposal, drainage
structures, erosion control and sedimentation control devices,
public improvements of open space and other on-site
improvements and landscaping, provided that no more than
ten percent (10%) of the total performance guaranty shall be in
cash, and the balance shall be in the form of a bond from a
bonding company approved by the borough. The Borough
Engineer shall review the improvements required by the
Planning Board which are to be bonded and itemize their cost.
Said itemization shall be the basis for determining the amount
of performance guaranty and maintenance guaranty required
by the Planning Board. The Borough Engineer shall forward his
estimate of the cost of improvements to the applicant within
thirty (30) days of the date of receipt of a request sent by
certified mail for said estimate.
(b) The furnishing of a maintenance guaranty to be posted with
the governing body for a period not to exceed two (2) years
after final acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to
exceed fifty percent (50%) of the cost of the improvement. In
the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities
automatically will own the utilities to be installed or the
improvements are covered by a performance or maintenance
guaranty to another governmental agency, no performance or
maintenance guaranty, as the case may be, shall be required
for such utilities or improvements.
(2) The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the
Borough Council, by resolution, when portions of the improvements
have been certified by the Borough Engineer to have been
completed. The time allowed for installation of the improvements
§ 127-8 VERONA CODE § 127-8
127:388
§ 127-9. Off-tract improvements.
for which the performance guaranty has been provided may be
extended by the Borough Council by resolution.
(3) If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety,
if any, shall be liable thereon to the borough for the reasonable cost
of the improvements not completed or corrected, and the borough
may, either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof,
complete such improvements.
(4) When all of the required improvements have been completed, the
obligor shall notify the Borough Council in writing, by certified mail
addressed in care of the Borough Clerk, of the completion of said
improvements and shall send a copy thereof to the Borough
Engineer. Thereupon the Borough Engineer shall inspect all of the
improvements and shall file a detailed report, in writing, with the
Borough Council, indicating either approval, partial approval or
rejection of the improvements with a statement of reasons for any
rejection. If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the
improvements rejected shall be set forth. Prior to final acceptance
of the improvements, the applicant shall file with the Borough
Engineer and Construction Code Official as-built drawings
prepared by the applicant's engineer and/or architect indicating
any approved changes from the final plat plan.
(5) The Borough Council shall either approve, partially approve or
reject the improvements on the basis of the report of the Borough
Engineer and shall notify the obligor in writing, by certified mail, of
the contents of said report and the action of Borough Council with
relation thereto, not later than sixty-five (65) days after receipt of
the notice from the obligor of the completion of the improvements.
Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be released
from all liability pursuant to its performance guaranty, except for
that portion adequately sufficient to secure provision of the
improvements not yet approved. Failure of the Borough Council to
send or provide such notification to the obligor within sixty-five (65)
days shall be deemed to constitute approval of the improvements,
and the obligor and surety, if any, shall be released from all liability,
pursuant to such performance guaranty.
(6) If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the
Borough Council may require the obligor to complete such
improvements, and, upon completion, the same procedure of
notification as set forth in this section shall be followed.
(7) Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the
obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the
Borough Council or the Borough Engineer.
§ 127-8 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 127-9
127:389
§ 127-10. Reservation of public areas.
A. As a condition for approval of a site plan, a developer may be required
by the Planning Board to pay his pro rata share of the cost of providing
only reasonable and necessary street improvements and water,
sewerage and drainage facilities and easements therefor, located
outside the property limits of the development but necessitated or
required by construction or improvement within such development.
B. Requirements for providing off-tract improvements shall be based on
the circulation and utility service plan elements of the Borough Master
Plan. The pro rata amount of the cost of such facilities that shall be
borne by such developer or owner within a related and common area
shall be determined by the Planning Board in accordance with the
following standards:
(1) Street improvements. The developer's share shall be based on the
average daily traffic generated by the proposed development, as a
proportion of total estimated average daily traffic on the street
based on complete development under existing zoning.
(2) Water, sewer and drainage improvements. The developer's share
shall be based on capacity required by the development in question
as a proportion of total capacity for the service area in which the
development is located.
C. Where a developer pays the amount determined as a pro rata share
under protest, he shall institute legal action within one (1) year of such
payment in order to preserve the right to a judicial determination as to
the fairness and reasonableness of such amount.
A. General requirements.
(1) If the Master Plan or the Official Map provides for the reservation
of designated streets, public drainageways, flood control basins or
public areas within the proposed development, before approving a
subdivision, the Planning Board may require that such streets,
ways, basins or areas be shown on the plat in locations and sizes
suitable to their intended uses. The Planning Board may reserve
the location and extent of such streets, ways, basins or areas shown
on the plat for a period of one (1) year after the approval of the final
plat or within such further time as may be agreed to by the
developer.
(2) Unless during such period or extension thereof the municipality
shall have entered into a contract to purchase or institute
condemnation proceedings according to law for the fee or a lesser
interest in the land comprising such streets, ways, basins or areas,
the developer shall not be bound by such reservations shown on the
plat and may proceed to use such land for private use in
accordance with applicable development regulations.
§ 127-9 VERONA CODE § 127-10
127:390
§ 127-11. Design standards.
The subdivider shall observe the following requirements and principles of
land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion thereof.
B. Applicability. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to streets
and roads, flood control basins or public drainageways necessitated by
the subdivision of land development and required for final approval.
C. Compensation. The developer shall be entitled to just compensation for
actual loss found to be caused by such temporary reservation and
deprivation of use. In such instances, unless a lesser amount has
previously been mutually agreed upon, just compensation shall be
deemed to be the fair market value of an option to purchase the land
reserved for the period of reservation, provided that determination of
such fair market value shall include, but not be limited to, consideration
of the real property taxes apportioned to the land reserved and
prorated for the period of reservation. The developer shall be
compensated for the reasonable increased cost of legal, engineering or
other professional services incurred in connection with obtaining
subdivision approval caused by the reservation.
A. General. The subdivision plat shall conform to design standards that
will encourage good development patterns within the borough. The
subdivision shall conform to the proposals and conditions of both the
Official Map and Master Plan as shown thereon. The streets, drainage
rights-of-way, school sites, public parks and playgrounds shown on the
officially adopted Master Plan or Official Map shall be considered in
approval of subdivision plats. Streets and drainage rights-of-way not
shown on the Master Plan or Official Map shall be shown on the final
plat in accordance with Section 38 of Chapter 291 of the laws of New
Jersey of 1975157 and shall be such as to lend themselves to the
harmonious development of the borough and enhance the public
welfare in accordance with the following design standards:
B. Streets.
(1) The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or
Official Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate
extension of existing streets.
(2) Minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage through traffic.
(3) Subdivisions abutting arterial streets shall provide a marginal
service road or reverse frontage with a buffer strip for planting or
some other means of separation of through and local traffic as the
Planning Board may determine appropriate.
(4) The right-of-way width shall be measured from lot line to lot line
and shall be as follows:

ARTICLE XIV
Metered/Permit Parking
§ 140-58. Definitions.
The following words and phrases, which are not defined in Subtitle 1 of
Title 39 of the Revised Statutes of New Jersey, shall have the meanings
respectively ascribed to them in this section for purposes of this article:
PARKING METER  A mechanical device or meter not inconsistent with
this article placed or erected for the regulation of parking by authority of
this article. Each parking meter installed shall indicate by proper legend
the legal parking time established by the Mayor and Council and, when
operated, shall at all times indicate the balance of legal parking time and,
at the expiration of such period, shall indicate illegal or overtime parking.
PARKING METER/PERMIT ZONE  Any restricted on-street or off-street
parking lot upon which parking meters are installed and in operation or in
which appropriate signs designate permit parking. Vehicles weighing over
7,000 pounds will not be permitted in permit parking spaces.
PARKING METER SPACE  Any space within a parking meter zone,
adjacent to a parking meter and which is duly designated for the parking of
a single vehicle by lines painted or otherwise durably marked on the curb
or on the surface of the street or lot adjacent to or adjoining the parking
meters.
PERMIT PARKING SPACE  Any space within a designated municipal
parking zone specifically authorized for the parking of a single vehicle
which displays an authorized permit issued by the municipality.
§ 140-59. Designations of parking spaces.
The Township Engineer is hereby directed and authorized to provide for the
marking off of individual parking spaces in the parking meter/permit zones
designated and described in § 140-68, said parking spaces to be designated
by lines painted or marked on the curbing or surface of the street or lot. At
each space so marked off, it shall be unlawful to park any vehicle in such a
way that said vehicle shall not be entirely within the limits of the space so
designated.
§ 140-60. Installation of parking meters/permit parking signs.
The Township Engineer shall cause parking meters to be installed upon
the curb, sidewalk or area immediately adjacent to the parking spaces
provided for in § 140-68 of this Article. No parking meters shall be installed
in areas where parking is prohibited pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A.
39:4-138. The Chief of Police shall be responsible for the regulation, control,
operation, maintenance and use of such parking meters. Each device shall
be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking upon the deposit of
the appropriate coin, lawful money of the United States of America, for the
period of time prescribed in § 140-69. Each device shall be so arranged that,
§ 140-58 TREES § 140-60
136:483
upon expiration of the lawful time limit, it will indicate by a proper, visible
signal that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such case the right
of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease and the operator, owner,
possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter
provided. Permit parking signs shall be installed adjacent to all designated
permit parking spaces.
§ 140-61. Operation of parking meters.
Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Fire or
Police Department or in compliance with the directions of a police officer
or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any
parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the
operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering said parking meter space,
immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper
coin of the United Sates of America as is required for such parking meter
and as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required
by the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the
deposit of the proper coin, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism
on such meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon,
and failure to deposit such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism
in operation when so required shall constitute a violation of this Article.
Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in
operation when so required), the parking space may be lawfully occupied
by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for
the part of the street in which said parking space is located, provided that
any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to a meter
which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous
occupant of the space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long as
his occupancy of said space does not exceed the indicated unused parking
time. If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space and if
the meter shall indicate such illegal parking, then and in that event such
vehicle shall be considered as parking overtime and beyond the period of
legal parking time, and such parking shall be deemed a violation of this
Article.
§ 140-62. Manner of parking.
When a parking meter space is parallel with the adjacent curb or sidewalk,
no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking
space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle
nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter space is diagonal to
the curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any
vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost
part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter or
permit parking sign shall have been installed at the head of and immediately
adjacent to any parking space on a municipal off-street parking lot, no
person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space
in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to
the parking meter or sign; provided, however, that in municipal off-street
§ 140-60 VERONA CODE § 140-62
136:484
parking lots, signs shall be erected indicating that head-on parking only is
permitted. In any event, a vehicle shall be parked within the lines marked
on the pavement measuring such parking space.
§ 140-63. Violations.
It shall be unlawful and a violation of the provisions of this Article for any
person to:
§ 140-64. Reports of violations; citations.
A. Cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in the name of or

described or to deposit in any parking meter any coin for the purpose of
parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for the particular
parking meter zone.
B. Permit any vehicle to remain or be placed in any parking space adjacent
to any parking meter while said meter is displaying a signal indicating
that the vehicle occupying such parking space has already been parked
beyond the period prescribed for such parking space.
C. Park any vehicle across any line or marking of a parking meter space or
in such position that the vehicle shall not be entirely within the area
designated by such lines or markings.
D. Deface, injure, tamper with, open or willfully break, destroy or impair
the usefulness of any parking meter installed under the provisions of
this Article.
E. Deposit or cause to be deposited in any parking meter any slug, device
or metal substance or other substitute for lawful coins.
F. Park or permit the parking of any vehicle in any parking meter space
where the meter does not register lawful parking.
G. Park or permit the parking of any vehicle in any permit parking space
unless the vehicle displays an authorized permit issued by the
municipality.
A. It shall be the duty of the police officers, acting in accordance with
instructions issued by the Chief of Police, to report:
(1) The number of each parking meter which indicates that the vehicle
occupying the parking space adjacent to such parking meter is or
has been parked in violation of any of the provisions of this Article.
(2) The state license number of such vehicle.
(3) That such vehicle is parked in violation of any of the provisions of
this Article.
§ 140-62 TREES § 140-64
136:485
§ 140-65. Impounding of vehicles.
Any vehicle left parked for a period exceeding two hours succeeding
expiration of the maximum parking time indicated during the hours of
operation specified in the space in which the vehicle is parked shall be
towed, under the direction of the Police Department, to the Township
Garage or any other place designated by the Chief of Police for
impoundment, subject to redemption by the owner upon payment of $50,
for towing charges, and a storage fee of $10, for each day or portion thereof
during which it remains in said garage or other place.
§ 140-66. Purpose of meter deposits/fees.
The coins required to be deposited in parking meters or fees collected for
permit parking as provided herein are levied and assessed as fees to provide
for the proper regulation and control of traffic upon the public streets
and also the cost of supervising and regulating the parking of vehicles
in the parking meter permit zones created thereby and to cover the cost
of the purchase, supervision, protection, inspection, installation, operation,
maintenance, control and use of the parking meters described herein.
§ 140-67. Collection of coins from meters; disposition thereof.
It shall be the duty of the Chief of Police to designate some proper person or
persons to make regular collections of the moneys deposited in said meters
and to deliver such to the Treasurer.
§ 140-68. Parking meter/permit parking zones designated.
(4) Any other facts, a knowledge of which is necessary to a thorough
understanding of the circumstances attending such violation.
B. Each such police officer shall also attach to such vehicle a notice to the
owner thereof that such vehicle has been parked in violation of a
provision of this Article and instructing such owner to report to the
Municipal Court in regard to such violation.
A. On-street parking meter zones. On all days between the hours of 8:00
a.m. and 6:00 p.m., except Saturdays and Sundays, parking or standing
a vehicle in parking meter space in the on-street parking meter zones

commencement of a new license term, the license shall expire at the
conclusion of that particular license term irrespective of the date of
issuance.

for all buildings, structures or premises which shall hereafter be
connected to the Township sanitary sewer system. The amount of
the connection fee for any building, structure or premises shall be
determined by the number of equivalent connections assigned to
the building, structure or premises to be connected, in accordance
with the following standards:
(a) Single-family detached residential buildings: one equivalent
connection.
(b) 183All other buildings: Equivalent connections shall be
determined by the Township Engineer based upon projected
daily sewer use flows by applying design flow standards
promulgated by the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, as amended and supplemented. The projected daily
sewer use flow shall be divided by 220 gallons, and the
resulting quotient shall be the number of equivalent
connections assigned to the building, structure or premises.
(2) The fee for each equivalent connection shall be as set forth in
Chapter A175, Fees, of the Verona Code as may be from time to
time amended by the Verona governing body.
B. Connection fees shall be due and payable to the Township at such time
as a building sewer permit is issued for connection to the sanitary
sewer system. [Amended 7-15-2002 by Ord. No. 7-2002]
C. In the event of a change in the use of any building, structure or
premises resulting in an increase in projected daily sewer use flows, the
Township Engineer shall determine the increase in the equivalent
connections assigned to such building, structure or premises and there
shall be an additional connection fee payable to the Township equal to
the increase in equivalent connections multiplied by the fee for each
sewer connection fee per equivalent connection as set forth in Chapter
A175. [Added 7-15-2002 by Ord. No. 7-2002]
A. Single-family residential users. The annual charge for a single-family
residential user shall be equal to the charge for one equivalent
connection as set forth in Chapter A175, Fees, of the Verona Code.
183. Editor's Note: Former Subsection A(1)(b), regarding other residential buildings, was
repealed 7-15-2002 by Ord. No. 7-2002. This ordinance also provided for the redesignation

fees, sewer user charges, and for services provided pursuant to this chapter
shall be as set forth in Chapter A175, Fees, of the Verona Code. The
Township governing body shall annually review such fees and charges as
provided by law.
B. Institutional users. The annual charge for institutional users of the
Township sanitary sewer shall be an amount equal to the fee for one
equivalent connection as established under Chapter A175, Fees, of the
Verona Code multiplied by the number of equivalent connections
chargeable to the sewer user as determined by the Township Engineer
in accordance with the method prescribed under Subsection D hereof.
[Amended 4-6-1998 by Ord. No. 5-98]
C. All other users. The annual charge for all other users of the Township
sanitary sewer, including but not limited to multifamily residential,
commercial and industrial users, shall be an amount equal to the fee for
one equivalent connection as established under Chapter A175, Fees, of
the Verona Code multiplied by the number of equivalent connections
chargeable to the sewer user as determined by the Township Engineer
in accordance with the method prescribed under Subsection D hereof.
[Added 4-6-1998 by Ord. No. 5-98]
D. For all users of the Township sanitary sewer, except single-family
residential users, the Township Engineer shall determine the average
gallons per day of metered water consumed by the sewer user by using
a base year period as established by the Township Engineer. The base
year shall be reviewed annually and may be changed as necessary to
provide equitable computations of equivalent connections. [Note:
Gallons per day (gpd) for billing purposes is based upon metered
consumption for the previous year.] The Township Engineer shall then
divide averaged gallons per day (user gpd) by 220 gallons per day. The
resulting quotient rounded to the nearest whole number shall
constitute the number of equivalent connections. In no event shall the
number of equivalent connections chargeable to such user be less than
one equivalent connection. [Added 4-6-1998 by Ord. No. 5-98]

ARTICLE XIIX HILLTOP PROPERTY REDEVELOPMENT REQUIREMENTS
150 - 18.1 PREAMBLE
The requirements which follow are intended to govern all development within the Verona Township portion of the Hilltop Property Redevelopment Area. These requirements supersede the zoning and development regulations currently applicable to the area being designated as a Redevelopment Area and will supersede all other requirements of Verona's Zoning Ordinance with respect to the properties encompassed within the Redevelopment Area except as specifically noted and referenced herein or where a specific standard to the contrary is not included herein. The requirements of Verona's Site Plan and Subdivision Ordinances shall, however, remain in full force and effect relative to development within the Redevelopment Area except where a specific requirement of one of these Ordinances is in direct conflict with a requirement or regulation contained herein, in which case, the requirement or regulation contained herein shall be applicable.
The purpose of multifamily housing, within the Hilltop Redevelopment Area, is to permit a procedure for development which will result in improved living environments by encouraging ingenuity and originality in total subdivision and individual site design and which will preserve open space to serve recreational, scenic, and public service purposes, and other purposes related thereto. It is the intention of this ordinance to provide for procedures for development of the district and to assure adequate protection of existing and potential developments adjoining the proposed development. To achieve these goals, this ordinance deviates in some respects from other zoning ordinance provisions and provides for building sizes and types that may not be permitted in other residential zones.
Interior Lot lines: In order to complement the goals that the developmental regulations contained herein achieve, the interior lot lines that are within the district, whether the interior lots are owned by one entity or multiple entities, are not to be utilized in computing set back lines, frontage, or any other bulk requirement contained herein.

This article establishes the standards for the collection, maintenance, and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's rules. Fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used for the sole purpose of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This article shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees.
150-21.2 BASIC REQUIREMENTS
The Township of Verona shall not spend development fees until COAH has approved a plan for spending such fees and the Township of Verona has received third round substantive certification from COAH or a judgment of compliance.
150-21.3 RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT FEES
A. Within all of the Township of Verona Zoning Districts, residential developers shall pay a fee of 1% of the equalized assessed value for residential development, provided no increased density is permitted.
B. When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted, developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be realized.
Example: If an approval allows for four units to be constructed on a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1% of the equalized assessed value on the first two units, and 6% of the equalized assessed value for the additional two units. However, if the zoning on the site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application, the density for the purposes of calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance application.

150-21.4 NON RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT FEES
A. Within all of the Township of Verona's zoning district(s), nonresidential developers shall pay a fee of 2% of the equalized assessed value for nonresidential development.
B. If an increase in floor area ratio is approved pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(4), then the additional floor area realized (above what is permitted by right under the existing zoning) will incur a bonus development fee of 6% of the equalized assessed value for nonresidential development. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application, the base floor area for the purposes of calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest floor area permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance application.
150-21.5 ELIGIBLE EXACTIONS; INELIGIBLE EXACTIONS AND EXEMPTIONS
A. Affordable housing developments shall be exempt from development fees. All other forms of new construction shall be subject to development fees unless exempted below.
B. Developments that have received preliminary or final approval prior to the imposition of a Township development fee shall be exempt from development fees unless the developer seeks a substantial change in the approval.
C. Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure is expanded or undergoes a change to a more intense use. The development fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed value of the improved structure.
D. Developers of tax-exempt or not-for-profit projects shall be subject to a reduced development fee of 1%.
E. Developers of existing single family residential dwellings shall be exempt from development fees, including additions, renovations, rebuilding or replacement of an existing single family dwelling and the construction of accessory buildings or other structures on the same lot as the principal dwelling, provided no increase in density is permitted.
Page 205
150-21.6 COLLECTION OF FEES
Fifty percent of the development fee will be collected at the time of issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion will be collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The developer shall be responsible for paying the difference between the fee calculated at building permit and that determined at issuance of certificate of occupancy.
150-21.7 CONTESTED FEES
Imposed and collected development fees that are challenged shall be placed in an interest-bearing escrow account by Township of Verona. If all or a portion of the contested fees are returned to the developer, the accrued interest on the returned amount shall also be returned.
150-21.8 AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRUST FUND
A. There is hereby created a separate, interest-bearing housing trust fund in JPMorgan Chase Bank for the purpose of depositing development fees collected from residential and nonresidential developers and proceeds from the sale of units with extinguished controls. All development fees paid by developers pursuant to this article shall be deposited into this fund.
B. Within seven days from the opening of the trust fund account, Township of Verona shall provide COAH with written authorization, in the form of a three-party escrow agreement between the Township, JPMorgan Chase Bank, and COAH to permit COAH to direct the disbursement of the funds as provided for in N.J.A.C. 5:94-6.16(b).
C. No funds shall be expended from the affordable housing trust fund unless the expenditure conforms to a spending plan approved by COAH. All interest accrued in the housing trust fund shall only be used on eligible affordable housing activities approved by COAH.
Page 206
150-21.9 USE OF FUNDS
A. Funds deposited in the housing trust fund may be used for any activity approved by COAH to address the Township's fair share. Such activities include, but are not limited to: rehabilitation, new construction, RCAs subject to the provisions of N.J.A.C. 5:94-4.4(d), ECHO housing, purchase of land for affordable housing, improvement of land to be used for affordable housing, purchase of housing, extensions or improvements of roads and infrastructure to affordable housing sites, financial assistance designed to increase affordability, or administration necessary for implementation of the housing element and fair share plan. The expenditure of all funds shall conform to a spending plan approved by COAH.
B. Funds shall not be expended to reimburse Township of Verona for past housing activities.
C. After subtracting development fees collected to finance an RCA, a rehabilitation program or a new construction project that are necessary to address the Township of Verona's affordable housing obligation, at least 30% of the balance remaining shall be used to provide affordability assistance to low- and moderate-income households in affordable units included in the municipal fair share plan. One-third of the affordability assistance portion of development fees collected shall be used to provide affordability assistance to those households earning 30% or less of median income by region.
1. Affordability assistance programs may include down payment assistance, security deposit assistance, low interest loans, and rental assistance.
2. Affordability assistance to households earning 30% or less of median income may include buying down the cost of low- or moderate-income units in the third round municipal fair share plan to make them affordable to households earning 30% or less of median income. The use of development fees in this manner shall entitle Township of Verona to bonus credits pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:94-4.22.
3. Payments in lieu of constructing affordable units on site and funds from the sale of units with extinguished controls shall be exempt from the affordability assistance requirement.
D. Township of Verona may contract with a private or public entity to administer any part of its housing element and fair share plan, including the requirement for affordability assistance, in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:94-7.
Page 207
E. No more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees each year, exclusive of the fees used to fund an RCA, shall be expended on administration, including but not limited to salaries and benefits for municipal employees or consultant fees necessary to develop or implement a new construction program, a housing element and fair share plan, and/or an affirmative marketing program. In the case of a rehabilitation program, no more than 20% of the revenues collected from development fees shall be expended for such administrative expenses. Administrative funds may be used for income qualification of households, monitoring the turnover of sale and rental units, and compliance with COAH's monitoring requirements. Development fee administrative costs are calculated and may be expended at the end of each year or upon receipt of the fees.
150-21.10 ONGOING COLLECTION OF FEES
The ability for the Township of Verona to impose, collect and expend development fees shall expire with its substantive certification or not later than December 21, 2013, unless the Township of Verona has filed an adopted housing element and fair share plan with COAH, has petitioned for substantive certification, and has received COAH's approval of its development fee ordinance. If the Township of Verona fails to renew its ability to impose and collect development fees prior to December 31, 2013, it may resume the imposition and collection of development fees only by complying with the requirements of N.J.A.C. 5:94-6. The Township of Verona shall not impose a development fee on a development that receives preliminary or final approval after the expiration of its substantive certification or not later than December 31, 2013, nor will the Township of Verona retroactively impose a development fee on such a development. The Township of Verona will not expend development fees after the expiration of its substantive certification and not later than December 31, 2013.
