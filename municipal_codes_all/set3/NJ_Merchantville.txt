ABANDONED PROPERTIES
§ 2-1. Abandoned property criteria.
A. Except as provided in N.J.S.A. 55:19-83, any property that has not been
legally occupied for a period of six months and which meets any one of
the following additional criteria may be deemed to be abandoned
property upon a determination by the Compliance Officer, or such other
public officer designated or appointed by the Borough Council pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, that:
(1) The property is in need of rehabilitation, in the reasonable
judgment of the Compliance Officer, or such other public officer
designated or appointed by the Borough Council pursuant to
N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, and no rehabilitation has taken place during that
same six-month period;
(2) Construction was initiated on the property and was discontinued
prior to completion, leaving the building unsuitable for occupancy,
and no construction has taken place for at least six months as of the
date of a determination by the Compliance Officer, or such other
public officer designated or appointed by the Borough Council
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5;
(3) At least one installment of property tax remains unpaid and
delinquent on that property as of the date of a determination by the
Compliance Officer, or such other public officer designated or
appointed by the Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5;
or
(4) The property has been determined to be a nuisance by the
Compliance Officer, or such other public officer designated or
appointed by the Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 55:19-82 for one or more of the following
reasons:
(a) The property has been found to be unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3;
(b) The condition and vacancy of the property materially increases
the risk of fire to the property and adjacent properties;
(c) The property is subject to unauthorized entry, leading to
potential health and safety hazards; the owner has failed to
take reasonable and necessary measures to secure the
property; or the municipality has secured the property in order
to prevent such hazards after the owner has failed to do so;
(d) The presence of vermin or the accumulation of debris or uncut
vegetation or physical deterioration of the structure or
§ 1-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-1
1:7
§ 2-2. Establishment; abandoned properties list.
grounds has created potential health and safety hazards, and
the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary
measures to remove the hazards; or
(e) The dilapidated appearance or other condition of the property
materially affects the welfare, including the economic welfare,
of the residents of the area in close proximity to the property,
and the owner has failed to take reasonable and necessary
measures to remedy the conditions.
B. A property which contains both residential and nonresidential space
may be considered abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. so
long as 2/3 or more of the total net square footage of the building was
previously legally occupied as residential space and none of the
residential space has been legally occupied for at least six months at
the time of the determination of abandonment by the Compliance
Officer, or such other public officer designated or appointed by the
Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5.
A. The Compliance Officer, or such other public officer designated or
appointed by the Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, shall
identify abandoned property within the Borough of Merchantville for
the purpose of establishing an abandoned property list. The abandoned
property list shall include, for each abandoned property identified, the
tax block and lot number, the name of the owner of record, if known,
and the street address of the lot. The Compliance Officer, or such other
public officer designated or appointed by the Borough Council pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, may add properties to the abandoned property list
at any time and may delete properties at any time when he or she finds
that the property no longer meets the definition of an abandoned
property.
B. An abandoned property shall not be included on the abandoned
property list if rehabilitation is being performed in a timely manner, as
evidenced by building permits issued and diligent pursuit of
rehabilitation work authorized by those permits. A property on which
an entity other than the Borough of Merchantville has purchased or
taken assignment from the Borough of a tax sale certificate which has
been placed on the abandoned property list may be removed if the
owner of the certificate pays all municipal taxes and liens due on the
property within 30 days after the property is placed on the list;
provided, however, that if the owner of the certificate fails to initiate
foreclosure proceedings within six months after the property was first
placed on the list, the property shall be restored to the abandoned
property list in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-2.
C. The Compliance Officer, or such other public officer designated or
appointed by the Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, shall
establish the abandoned property list and any additions or deletions
§ 2-1 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 2-2
1:8
thereto by authorizing the publication of the list in the official
newspaper of the Borough of Merchantville, which publication shall
constitute public notice, and, within 10 days after publication, shall
send a notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by
regular mail, to the owner of record of every property included on
the list. The published and mailed notices shall identify property
determined to be abandoned, setting forth the owner of record, if
known, the tax lot and block number, and the street address. The
Compliance Officer, or such other public officer designated or
appointed by the Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, in
consultation with the Tax Collector, shall also send out a notice, by
regular mail, to any mortgagee, servicing organization, or property
tax processing organization that receives a duplicate copy of the tax
bill pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:4-64d. When the owner of record is not
known for a particular property and cannot be ascertained by the
exercise of reasonable diligence by the Tax Collector, notice shall not
be mailed but instead shall be posted on the property in the manner
as provided in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.7. The mailed notice shall indicate the
factual basis for the finding of the Compliance Officer, or such other
public officer designated or appointed by the Borough Council pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, that the property is abandoned property, as that
term is defined herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54, and shall specify the
information relied upon in making such finding. In all cases, a copy
of the mailed or posted notice shall also be filed by the Compliance
Officer, or such other public officer designated or appointed by the
Borough Council pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, in the office of the
Camden County Clerk. This filing shall have the same force and effect
as a formal notice under N.J.S.A. 2A:15-6. The notice shall be captioned
with the name of the Borough of Merchantville as "plaintiff" and the
name of the property owner as "defendant," as though an action had
been commenced by the Borough against the owner.
D. An owner or lienholder may challenge the inclusion of his property on
the abandoned property list by appealing that determination to the
Borough Council within 30 days of the owner's receipt of the certified
notice or 40 days from the date upon which the notice was sent. An
owner whose identity was not known to the Compliance Officer, or such
other public officer designated or appointed by the Borough Council
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5, shall have 40 days from the date upon
which notice was published or posted, whichever is later, to challenge
the inclusion of a property on the abandoned property list. For good
cause shown, the Borough Council shall accept a late filing of an appeal.
Within 30 days of receipt of a request for an appeal of the findings
contained in the notice, the Borough Council shall schedule a hearing
for redetermination of the matter. Any property included on the list
shall be presumed to be abandoned property unless the owner, through
the submission of an affidavit or certification asserting that the
property is not an abandoned property, can demonstrate that the
property was erroneously included on the list. The affidavit or
certification shall be accompanied by supporting documentation, such
§ 2-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-2
1:9
§ 2-3. Interested parties may request additions to the abandoned
properties list.
as, but not limited to, photographs, repair invoices, bills and
construction contracts. The sole ground for appeal shall be that the
property in question is not abandoned property as that term is defined
herein and in N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The Borough Council shall decide any
timely filed appeal within 10 days of the hearing on the appeal and shall
promptly, by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by regular
mail, notify the property owner of the decision and the reasons therefor.
E. The property owner may challenge an adverse determination of an
appeal with the Borough Council pursuant to Subsection D of this
section by instituting, in accordance with the New Jersey Court Rules, a
summary trial proceeding in the Superior Court, Camden County. Such
action shall be instituted within 20 days of the date of the notice of
decision mailed by the Borough Council. The sole ground for appeal and
new hearing before the Superior Court shall be that the property in
question is not an abandoned property, as that term is defined in
N.J.S.A. 55:19-54. The failure to institute an action of appeal on a timely
basis shall constitute a jurisdictional bar to challenging the adverse
determination, except that, for good cause shown, the court may extend
the deadline for instituting the action.
F. The Borough shall promptly remove any property from the abandoned
property list that has been determined by the Governing Body or on
appeal not to be abandoned and may, in its discretion, remove
properties from said list whenever the Governing Body deems such
removal appropriate under the circumstances.
G. The abandoned property list shall become effective, and the Borough of
Merchantville shall have the right to pursue any legal remedy with
respect to properties on the list, at any time after at least one property
has been placed on the list and following the expiration of the period for
appeal with respect to that first property or upon the denial of an
appeal brought by the property owner of that first property.
A. Any interested party may submit a written request to the Borough
Council asserting that any property within the Borough of
Merchantville should be included on the abandoned property list. The
written request must specify the street address and block and lot
number of the property to be included and the grounds for its inclusion.
Within 30 days of receipt of any such request, the Borough Council shall
provide a written response to the party, either indicating that the
property will be added to the list or, if not, the reasons for not adding
the property. For the purposes of this section, the term "interested
parties" shall include any resident of the Borough of Merchantville, any
owner or operator of a business within the Borough of Merchantville or
any organization representing the interests of residents, business
owners or otherwise engaged in furthering the revitalization and
improvement of the neighborhood in which the property is located.
§ 2-2 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 2-3
1:10
§ 2-4. Removal of property from abandoned properties list.
B. Any interested party may participate in a redetermination hearing
regarding the inclusion of a property on the abandoned property list.
Upon written request by any interested party, the Borough Council shall
provide that party with at least 20 days' notice of any such hearing. The
party shall provide the Borough Council with notice at least 10 days
before the hearing of its intention to participate and the nature of the
testimony or other information that it proposes to submit at the
hearing.
A. An owner may request removal of his/her/its property from the
abandoned properties list prior to sale of the tax sale certificate by
paying all taxes and Borough liens due, including interest and penalties,
and:
(1) By posting cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating all
conditions because of which the property has been determined to
be abandoned pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55 and by posting cash or
a bond to cover the cost of any environmental cleanup required on
the property, evidenced by a certification by a licensed engineer
retained by the owner and reviewed and approved by the Borough
Council, stating that the cash or bond adequately covers the cost of
the cleanup; or
(2) By demonstrating to the satisfaction of the Borough Council that
the conditions rendering the property abandoned have been
remediated in full; provided, however, that where the Borough
Council finds that the owner is actively engaged in remediating the
conditions because of which the property was determined to be
abandoned, as evidenced by significant rehabilitation activity on
the property, the Borough Council may grant an extension of time
of not more than 120 days for the owner to complete all work,
during which time no further proceedings will be taken against the
owner or the property.
B. If the owner has posted cash or a bond in order to have a property
removed from the abandoned property list and the conditions because
of which the property was determined to be abandoned have not been
fully remediated within one year of the date of posting the cash or bond,
or, in the case of a property which requires a remediation of any known,
suspected or threatened release of contaminants, if the owner has
failed to enter into a memorandum of agreement with the New Jersey
Department of Environmental Protection or an administrative consent
order, as the case may be, or if an agreement or order is in effect but the
owner has failed to perform the remediation in conformance with the
agreement or order, then the cash or bond shall be forfeited to the
Borough, which shall use the cash or bond and any interest which has
accrued thereon for the purpose of demolishing or rehabilitating the
property or performing the environmental remediation. Any funds
§ 2-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-4
1:11
§ 2-5. Sale of restricted tax liens.
remaining after the property has been demolished, rehabilitated or
cleaned up shall be returned to the owner.
A. Notwithstanding the provisions of N.J.S.A. 54:5-19, or the provisions of
any other law to the contrary, if a property is included on the abandoned
property list and the property taxes or other Borough liens due on the
property are delinquent for six or more quarters as of the date of
expiration of the right to appeal the property's inclusion on the list or, if
an appeal has been filed, as of the date that all opportunities for appeal
of inclusion on the list have been exhausted, then the tax lien on the
property may be sold in accordance with the procedures of the Tax Sale
Law, N.J.S.A. 54:5-1 et seq., on or after the 90th day following the
expiration of that time of appeal or final determination on an appeal.
B. The Borough of Merchantville may, at its option, require that the sale of
the tax sale certificate or any subsequent assignment or transfer of a
tax sale certificate held by the Borough be subject to the express
condition that the purchaser or assignee shall be obliged to perform
and conclude any rehabilitation or repairs necessary to remove the
property from the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55
and to post a bond in favor of the Borough to guarantee the
rehabilitation or repair of the property. The Borough Council may waive
a requirement to post a bond imposed by the Borough for any
purchaser, assignee or transferee of a tax sale certificate that provides
documentation acceptable to the Borough Council that the purchaser,
assignee or transferee is a qualified rehabilitation entity as defined in
N.J.S.A. 55:19-80. The cost of rehabilitation and repairs and the cost of
the bond shall be added to the amount required to be paid by the owner
for redemption of the property. The purchaser, assignee or transferee of
the tax sale certificate who is required to rehabilitate and repair the
property shall be required to file the appropriate affidavits with the Tax
Collector, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-62, representing the amounts of
moneys expended periodically toward the rehabilitation or repair of the
property. A purchaser, assignee or transferee shall be entitled to
interest on the amounts expended, as set forth in the affidavits, at the
delinquent rate of interest for delinquencies in excess of $1,500 in
effect for the time period when the amounts were expended, pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 54:4-67. The tax sale certificate purchaser, assignee or
transferee, with the authority of the Borough of Merchantville, shall be
permitted to enter in and upon the property for the purposes of
appraising the costs of rehabilitation and repair and to perform all
other acts required to guarantee the completion of the rehabilitation or
repair of the property. No rehabilitation or repair work shall be
commenced, however, until proof of adequate liability insurance and an
indemnification agreement, holding the Borough of Merchantville
harmless, has been filed with the Borough Clerk.
§ 2-4 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 2-5
1:12
§ 2-6. Special tax sale and criteria for bidders.
C. If the Borough of Merchantville acquires the tax sale certificate for a
property on the abandoned property list, then, upon 10 days' written
notice to the property owner and any mortgagee as of the date of the
filing of the notice pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-55, the Borough shall be
permitted to enter upon the property and remediate any conditions that
caused the property to be included on the abandoned property list. No
remediation shall be commenced, however, if, within that ten day
period, the owner or mortgagee shall have notified the Borough, in
writing, that the owner or mortgagee has elected to perform the
remediation itself. When the owner or mortgagee elects to perform the
remediation itself, it shall be required to post bond in favor of the
Borough of Merchantville in order to ensure performance. The amount
and conditions of the bond shall be determined by the Borough Council.
D. The cost of remediation incurred by the Borough of Merchantville, as so
certified by the entity incurring the cost upon completion of the
remediation, shall constitute a lien upon the property first in time and
right to any other lien, whether the other lien was filed prior to or after
the filing of any lien by the Borough, except for Borough taxes, liens and
assessments and any lien imposed pursuant to the Spill Compensation
and Control Act, N.J.S.A. 58:10-23.11 et seq., together with any interest
thereon. The certification of cost shall be filed and recorded as a lien by
the entity incurring the cost with the Camden County Clerk.
E. The clearance, development, redevelopment, or repair of property
being maintained as an abandoned property pursuant to this chapter
shall be considered a public purpose and public use, for which the
power of eminent domain may be lawfully exercised.
A. The Borough of Merchantville may hold special tax sales with respect to
those properties eligible for tax sale pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-19 which
are also on the abandoned property list.
B. The Borough Council shall establish criteria for eligibility to bid on
properties at the sale, which may include, but need not be limited to:
(1) Documentation of the bidder's ability to rehabilitate or otherwise
reuse the property consistent with Borough plans and regulations;
commitments by the bidder to rehabilitate or otherwise reuse the
property, consistent with Borough plans and regulations;
(2) Commitments by the bidder to take action to foreclose on the tax
lien by a date certain; and
(3) Such other criteria as the Borough Council may determine are
necessary to ensure that the properties to be sold will be
rehabilitated or otherwise reused in a manner consistent with the
public interest.
§ 2-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-6
1:13
§ 2-7. Expedited action to foreclose right of redemption.
C. The Borough Council may establish minimum bid requirements for a
special tax sale that are less than the full amount of the taxes, interest
and penalties due, to help ensure that the properties will be
rehabilitated or otherwise utilized in a manner consistent with the
public interest.
D. The Borough Council may combine properties in said special tax sale
into bid packages and require that bidders place a single bid on each
package, rejecting any and all bids on individual properties that are
submitted.
E. The Borough Council may sell said properties subject to the provision
that, if the purchaser fails to carry out any commitment that has been
set forth as a condition of sale or misrepresents any material
qualification that has been established as a condition of eligibility to bid
pursuant thereto, then the properties and any interest thereto acquired
by the purchaser shall revert to the Borough, and any amount paid by
the purchaser at the special tax sale shall be forfeit to the Borough.
F. In the event there are two or more qualified bidders for any property or
bid package in a special tax sale, the Borough may designate the
unsuccessful qualified bidder whose bid was closest to the successful
bid as an eligible purchaser. In the event that the selected purchaser of
that property or bid package fails to meet any of the conditions of sale
established by the Borough pursuant to this section and his/her/its
interest in the property or properties reverts to the Borough, the
Borough may subsequently designate the entity previously designated
as an eligible purchaser as the winning bidder for the property or
properties and assign the tax sale certificates to that entity on the basis
of that entity's bid at the special tax sale, subject to the terms and
conditions of the special tax sale.
G. The Borough of Merchantville shall provide notice of a special tax sale
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-26. The notice shall include any special terms
of sale established by the Borough pursuant to this section. Nothing
shall prohibit the Borough from holding a special tax sale on the same
day as a standard or accelerated tax sale.
A. When a person or entity other than the Borough of Merchantville
acquires a tax sale certificate for a property on the abandoned property
list at tax sale, the purchaser may institute an action to foreclose the
right of redemption at any time after the expiration of just six months
following the date of the sale of the tax sale certificate.
B. When the Borough of Merchantville is the purchaser at tax sale of any
property on the abandoned property list pursuant to N.J.S.A. 54:5-34, an
action to foreclose the right of redemption may be instituted in
accordance with the provisions of Subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-77.
§ 2-6 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 2-7
1:14
§ 2-8. Abandoned property status during expedited foreclosure.
§ 2-9. Summary action for control and possession of abandoned
property.
C. After the foreclosure action is instituted, the right to redeem shall exist
and continue to exist until barred by the judgment of the Superior
Court; provided, however, that no redemption shall be permitted except
where the owner:
(1) Posts cash or a bond equal to the cost of remediating the conditions
because of which the property was determined to be abandoned
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-56, as determined by the court; or
(2) Demonstrates to the court that the conditions because of which the
property was determined to be abandoned have been remedied in
full.
A. If an entity other than the Borough of Merchantville has purchased or
taken assignment from the Borough of a tax sale certificate on a
property that has not been legally occupied for a period of six months,
that property shall not be added to the abandoned property list under
the following limited circumstances:
(1) The owner of the certificate has continued to pay all Borough taxes
and liens on the property in the tax year when due; and
(2) The owner of the certificate takes action to initiate foreclosure
proceedings within six months after the property is eligible for
foreclosure pursuant to either Subsection a or Subsection b of
N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, as appropriate, and diligently pursues foreclosure
proceedings in a timely fashion thereafter.
B. A property used on a seasonal basis shall be deemed abandoned only if
it meets any two of the additional criteria set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81.
C. A determination that a property is abandoned property under the
provisions of this chapter and N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq. shall not
constitute a finding that the use of the property has been abandoned for
purposes of municipal zoning or land use regulation.
D. Upon the request of a purchaser or assignee of a tax sale certificate
seeking to bar the right of redemption on an abandoned property
pursuant to Subsection b of N.J.S.A. 54:5-86, the Borough Council or the
Tax Collector shall, in a timely fashion, provide the requester with a
certification that the property fulfills the definition of an "abandoned
property" according to the criteria established in N.J.S.A. 55:19-81 and
N.J.S.A. 55:19- 82.
A. A summary action or other action to transfer possession and control of
abandoned property in need of rehabilitation to the Borough of
Merchantville may be brought by the Borough in the Superior Court,
§ 2-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-9
1:15
Camden County. If the court shall find that the property is abandoned
and that the owner or party in interest has failed to submit and initiate
a rehabilitation plan, then the court may authorize the Borough to
take possession and control of the property and to develop its own
rehabilitation plan for the property.
B. Where the Borough has been granted possession and control, the
Borough may commence and maintain further proceedings for the
conservation, protection or disposal of the property, or any part thereof,
that are required to rehabilitate the property, recoup the cost and
expenses of rehabilitation, and for the sale of the property; provided,
however, that the court shall not direct the sale of the property if the
owner applies to the court for reinstatement of control and possession
of the property as permitted by N.J.S.A. 55:19-92.
C. Failure by the owner, mortgage holder or lienholder to submit a plan for
rehabilitation to the Borough, obtain appropriate construction permits
or, in the alternative, submit formal applications for funding the cost of
rehabilitation to local, state or federal agencies providing such funding,
within the initial six-month period, shall be deemed clear evidence that
the owner has failed to take any action to further the rehabilitation of
the property.
D. An owner may defend against a complaint filed pursuant to N.J.S.A.
55:19-84 by submitting a plan for the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property which is the subject of the complaint and by posting a bond
equal to 125% of the amount determined by the Borough Council or the
court to be the projected cost of rehabilitation.
E. Any plan submitted by an owner to defend against a complaint shall be
submitted within 60 days after the complaint has been filed, unless the
court provides the owner with an extension of time for good cause
shown. A plan submitted by an owner pursuant to this section shall
include, but not be limited to:
(1) A detailed financial feasibility analysis, including documentation of
the economic feasibility of the proposed reuse, including operating
budgets or resale prices, or both, as appropriate;
(2) A budget for the rehabilitation of the property, including sources
and uses of funds, based on the terms and conditions of realistically
available financing, including grants and loans;
(3) A timetable for the completion of rehabilitation and reuse of the
property, including milestones for performance of major steps
leading to and encompassing the rehabilitation and reuse of the
property; and
(4) Documentation of the qualifications of the individuals and firms
that will be engaged to carry out the planning, design, financial
packaging, construction, and marketing or rental of the property.
§ 2-9 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 2-9
1:16
§ 2-10. Borough rehabilitation or designation of qualified
rehabilitation entity.
F. Where the court approves the rehabilitation plan of the owner or other
party in interest, then it may appoint the Borough Council to act as
monitor of compliance and progress. If the owner fails to carry out any
step in the approved plan, then the Borough may apply to the court to
have the posted bond forfeited, to transfer possession of the building to
the Borough to complete the rehabilitation plan, and to grant
authorization to use the bond proceeds for the rehabilitation. The
owner or other party in interest shall provide bimonthly reports to the
Borough Council on its activities and progress toward rehabilitation
and reuse of the property.
G. If an owner is unsuccessful in defending against a complaint filed
pursuant to N.J.S.A. 55:19-84, the mortgage holder or lienholder may
seek to be designated in possession of the property by submitting a plan
and posting a bond meeting the same conditions as set forth in N.J.S.A.
55:19-87. His/her/its plan must be submitted within 60 days following
the court's rejection of the owner's plan, unless the court provides the
mortgage holder or lienholder with an extension of time for good cause
shown. If the court approves any such mortgage holder or lienholder's
plan, it shall designate that party to be in possession of the property for
purposes of ensuring its rehabilitation.
H. The mortgage holder or lienholder, as the case may be, shall provide
bimonthly reports to the court and the Borough Council on its activities
and progress toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. If the
mortgage holder or lienholder fails to carry out any material step in the
approved plan, then the Borough Council shall notify the court, which
may order the posted bond forfeit, grant the Borough possession of the
property, and authorize the Borough to use the proceeds of the bond for
rehabilitation of the property.
I. Any sums incurred or advanced for the purpose of rehabilitating the
property by a mortgage holder or lienholder granted possession of a
property, including court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees, may be
added to the unpaid balance due to that mortgage holder or lienholder,
with interest calculated at the same rate set forth in the note or security
agreement or, in the case of a tax lienholder, at the statutory interest
rate for subsequent liens.
J. If no mortgage holder or lienholder meets the conditions of N.J.S.A.
55:19-88, then the Borough may submit a plan to the court which
conforms with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-87. Such plan shall
designate whether the Borough or a qualified rehabilitation entity shall
undertake the rehabilitation plan in accordance with the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 55:19- 90.
A. The Borough Council may designate a qualified rehabilitation entity for
the purpose of exercising the Borough's rights, where that designation
§ 2-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 2-10
1:17
will further the rehabilitation and reuse of the property consistent with
Borough plans and objectives.
B. Regardless of whether the Borough exercises its rights directly or the
Borough Council designates a qualified rehabilitation entity pursuant to
this section, the Borough shall maintain, safeguard, and maintain
insurance on the property while in possession of such property.
Notwithstanding the Borough's possession of the property, the owner of
the property shall not be relieved of any civil or criminal liability or any
duty imposed by reason of acts or omissions of the owner.
C. The court may approve the borrowing of funds by the Borough to
rehabilitate the property and may grant a lien or security interests with
priority over all other liens or mortgages other than municipal liens.
Prior to granting this lien priority, the court must find as follows:
(1) The Borough sought to obtain the necessary financing from the
senior lienholder, which declined to provide such financing on
reasonable terms;
(2) The Borough sought to obtain a voluntary subordination from the
senior lienholder, which refused to provide such subordination; and
(3) Lien priority is necessary in order to induce another lender to
provide financing on reasonable terms. No lien authorized by the
court shall take effect unless recorded with the Clerk of Camden
County.
D. Where the Borough has designated a qualified rehabilitation entity to
act on its behalf, the qualified rehabilitation entity shall provide
bimonthly reports to the Borough Council on its activities and progress
toward rehabilitation and reuse of the property. The Borough or
qualified rehabilitation entity, as the case may be, shall provide such
reports to the court as the court determines to be necessary. If the court
finds that the Borough or its designee has failed to take diligent action
toward rehabilitation of the property within one year from the grant of
possession, then the court may request that the Borough designate
another qualified rehabilitation entity to exercise its rights or, if the
Borough fails to do so, may terminate the order of possession and
return possession and control of the property to its owner.
E. The Borough of Merchantville shall file a notice of completion with the
court, and shall also serve a copy on the owner and any mortgage
holder or lienholder, at such time as the Borough has determined that
no more than six months remain to the anticipated date on which
rehabilitation will be complete. This notice shall include an affidavit of
the Borough Council, attesting that the rehabilitation is anticipated to
be completed within six months, and a statement setting forth the
actions as it plans to undertake consistent with the plan.

§ 2-11. Petition for reinstatement of control and possession of
owner.
§ 2-12. Procedure for Borough of place liens, obtain title and sell
property.
A. An owner may petition for reinstatement of the owner's control and
possession of the property at any time after one year from the court's
removal of possession, but no later than 30 days after the Borough of
Merchantville has filed a notice of completion with the court or, in the
event the notice of completion is filed within less than one year of the
grant of possession, within 30 days after the Borough has filed said
notice.
B. The court may allow additional time for good cause if that additional
time does not materially delay completion of the rehabilitation, place
undue hardship on the Borough or affect any of the terms or conditions
under which the Borough has applied for or received financing for the
rehabilitation of the property.
C. If the owner fails to petition for the reinstatement of control and
possession of the property within 30 days after the Borough has filed a
notice of completion or, in any event, within two years after the initial
grant of possession, or if the owner fails to meet any conditions that
may be set by the court in granting a reinstatement petition, the court
may grant the Borough title or authorize the Borough to sell the
property, subject to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 55:19-96.
A. The Borough Council, with the approval of the court, may place a lien
on the property to cover any costs of the Borough in connection with
any proceeding under N.J.S.A. 55:19-78 et seq., incurred prior to the
grant by the court of an order of possession, which may include costs
incurred to stabilize or secure the property to ensure that it can be
rehabilitated in a cost-effective manner. Any such lien shall be
considered a Borough lien for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 54:5-9, with the
rights and status of a Borough lien pursuant thereto.
B. Where the Borough seeks to gain title to the property, it shall purchase
the property for fair market value on such terms as the court shall
approve and may place the proceeds of sale in escrow with the court.
C. The court may authorize the Borough of Merchantville to sell the
building free and clear of liens, claims and encumbrances, in which
event all such liens, claims and encumbrances shall be transferred to
the proceeds of sale with the same priority as existed prior to resale in
accordance with the provisions of this section, except that municipal
liens shall be paid at settlement. The proceeds of the purchase of the
property shall be distributed as set forth in N.J.S.A. 55:19-97.
D. Upon approval by the court, the Borough shall sell the property on such
terms and at such price as the court shall approve and may place the

protect the cat and public health, before taking further action. In the
case of an emergency, the animal control officer or police officer may
remove the cat, but within 24 hours the municipality must provide the
sponsor with notice of the cat's whereabouts and allow the sponsor an
opportunity to retrieve the cat for treatment, return, or relocation.

§ 18A-8 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 19-1
1:90
JUVENILE OR MINOR  Juvenile or minor is any person under the age of
eighteen (18) years of age.
PARENT  Parent is any person having legal custody of a juvenile (i) as
a natural or adoptive parent, (ii) as a legal guardian, (iii) as a person who
stands in loco parentis or (iv) as a person to whom legal custody has been
given by order of court.
PUBLIC PLACE  Public place means any place to which the public has
access, including but not limited to a public street, road, thoroughfare,
sidewalk, bridge, alley, plaza, park, recreation or shopping area, public
transportation facility, vehicle used for public transportation, parking lot or
any other public building, structure or area.
REMAIN  Remain means to stay behind, to tarry and to stay unnecessarily
upon any public place, including the congregating of groups (or of
interacting minors) totaling four or more persons in which any juvenile
involved would not be using the public places for ordinary or serious
purposes such as mere passage or going home or shopping or engaging
in specific Borough, school or church sponsored activities. To implement
that thought with additional precision and precaution, numerous exceptions
are expressly defined in this chapter so that this is not a mere prohibit
or presence type curfew ordinance. More and more exceptions become
available with increasing years and advancing maturity as appropriate in
the interest of reasonable regulation.
TIME OF NIGHT  Time of night referred to herein is based upon the
prevailing standard of time, whether Eastern Standard Time or Eastern
Daylight Savings Time, generally observed at that hour by the public in the
Borough, prima facie the time then observed in the Borough Administrative
Offices and police station.
YEARS OF AGE  Years of age continues from one birthday, such as
the seventeenth to (but not including the day of) the next, such as the
eighteenth birthday, making it clear that seventeen or less years treated as
equivalent to the phrase "under eighteen years of age."
§ 19-2. Curfew for Juveniles.
It shall be unlawful for any person under eighteen (18) years of age to be or
remain in or upon the public places within the Borough of Merchantville at
night during the period ending at 6:00 a.m. and beginning:
§ 19-3. Exceptions.
In the following exceptional cases, a minor located upon a public place
during the nocturnal hours for minors, their parents and their fellowcitizens
shall not, however, be considered in violation of this chapter.
A. At 11:00 p.m. Friday and Saturday nights, and
B. At 10:00 p.m. on all other nights.
§ 19-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 19-3
1:91
§ 19-4. Parental Responsibility.
It shall be unlawful for a parent having legal custody of a juvenile knowingly
to permit or by inefficient control to allow the juvenile to be or remain upon
any public place under circumstances not constituting an exception to, or
otherwise beyond the scope of, this chapter. The term "knowingly" includes
knowledge that a parent should reasonably be expected to have concerning
the whereabouts of a juvenile in that parent's legal custody. It is intended
to continue to keep neglectful or careless parents up to a reasonable
community standard of parental responsibility through an objective test. It
A. When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
B. When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take said parent's place in accompanying said minor for a designated
period of time and purpose within a specified area.
C. In case of reasonable necessity for the juvenile remaining upon the
public places but only after the juvenile's parent has communicated to
the Chief of Police or the person designated by the Chief of Police to
receive such notifications the facts establishing the reasonable
necessity relating to specified public places at a designated time for a
described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of
the communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the
Police Department to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the
time it was received and of the names and addresses of the parent and
juvenile, shall be admissible evidence.
D. When the juvenile is on the sidewalk or property where the juvenile
resides, or on either side of or across the street from the place where
the juvenile resides and the adult owner or resident of that property has
given permission for the juvenile to be there.
E. When returning home from and within one (1) hour after the
termination of a school or Borough sponsored activity, or an activity of a
religious or other voluntary association.
F. When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel. It is the intention of this provision to
clearly exempt bona fide interstate movements along major routes
through Merchantville Borough and interstate travel beginning or
ending in Merchantville Borough.
G. Each of the foregoing exceptions, and their several limitations such as
provisions for notification, are severable, as hereinafter provided but
here reemphasized will be considered by Borough Council as warranted
by future experience illuminated by the views of student government
associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, parents, officers
and person in authority concerned positively with juveniles as well as
with juvenile delinquency.
§ 19-3 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 19-4
1:92
shall, therefore, be no defense that a parent was completely indifferent to
the activities or conduct or whereabouts of such juvenile.
§ 19-5. Enforcement Procedure.
A. Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of experience
and may provide that the police officer may deliver to a parent, or
guardian thereof a juvenile under appropriate circumstances, for
example, a juvenile of tender age near home whose identity and address
may readily be ascertained or are known.
B. In any event the police officer shall, within 24 hours, file a written
report with the Chief of Police or shall participate to the extent of the
information for which he is responsible in the preparation of a report on
the curfew violation. It is not the intention of this section to require
incident reports that will prevent police officers from performing their
primary police duties. The reports shall be as simple as is reasonably
possible and may be completed by police departmental personnel other
than sworn police officers.
C. When a parent or guardian, immediately called, has come to take
charge of the juvenile, and the appropriate information has been
recorded, the juvenile shall be released to the custody of such parent. If
the parent cannot be located or fails to take charge of the juvenile, then
the juvenile shall be released to the juvenile authorities, except to the
extent that in accordance with police regulations, approved in advance
by juvenile authorities, the juvenile may temporarily be entrusted to an
adult, neighbor or other person who will on behalf of a parent or
guardian assume the responsibility for caring for the juvenile pending
the availability or arrival of a parent or guardian.
D. In the case of a first violation by a juvenile, the Chief of Police shall by
certified mail, send to a parent or guardian, written notice of the
violation with a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full
enforcement of this chapter, including enforcement of parental
responsibility and of applicable penalties.
A. If a police officer reasonably believes that a juvenile is upon the public
place in violation of this chapter, the officer shall notify the juvenile that
he or she is in violation of this chapter and shall require the juvenile to
provide his or her name, address and telephone number and how to
contact his or parent or guardian.
B. In determining the age of the juvenile and in the absence of convicting
evidence such as a birth certificate, a police officer shall, in the first
instance, use his or her best judgment in determining age.
C. The normal procedure shall then be to take the juvenile to the police
station where a parent or guardian shall immediately be notified to
come for the juvenile whereupon they shall be questioned. This is
intended to permit ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of
§ 19-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 19-5
1:93
§ 19-6. Halloween.
Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, it shall
be unlawful for any child under the age of eighteen (18) years to be upon the

31st day of October, until 6:00 a.m. the following morning, unless exempted
from this section under Section 19-3 of this chapter.
§ 19-7. Notice.
Notice of the existence of this chapter and the curfew regulations
established by it shall be posted in, on or at such public and quasi-public
places as may be determined by the Chief of Police, in order that the
public may be constantly informed of the existence of this chapter and its
regulations.
§ 19-8. Penalties.
Any person, as defined in Section 19-1, convicted of a violation of any
provision of this chapter shall be subject to a fine of up to $1,000.00, and
may be required to perform community service of up to 10 days. As provided
in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.52, whenever both a juvenile and the juvenile's parent or
guardian violate this chapter, they may be required to perform community
service together.

EMERGENCY WATER REGULATIONS
§ 22-1. Purpose; intent.
Protracted periods of high temperatures and limited rainfall may cause
excessive demands upon the water system of the Merchantville-Pennsauken
Water Commission, and a temporary lack of sufficient water capacity may
result in a lowering of the normal water levels of the sources of water supply
to the Merchantville-Pennsauken Water Commission, and the excessive use
of water during the spring, summer and fall months caused by the
sprinkling of lawns, filling of swimming pools, car washing and other similar
uses not related to the use of water for domestic and sanitary purposes
and fire protection may cause a serious reduction in adequate pressure in
the water distribution systems of the franchise area of the Merchantville-
Pennsauken Water Commission, which includes residents of this
(3) That such school property is and continues to be used for school
purposes.
(4) The location and boundaries of areas which are on or within one
thousand (1,000) feet of such school property.
B. Except as is otherwise expressly noted on the face of the approved and
adopted map, all of the property depicted on the map approved and
adopted herein as school property was owned by a school or School
Board and was being used for school purposes as of July 9, 1987, that
being the effective date of P.L. 1987, c. 101 (N.J.S.A. 2C:35-7).
C. Pursuant to the provisions of P.L. 1988, c. 44,11 a prosecutor is not
precluded from introducing or relying upon any other evidence or
testimony to establish a violation of the offense defined in that statute,
including use of a map or diagram other than the one approved and
adopted pursuant to § 21A-1 of this chapter. The failure of the map
approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any property
which is owned by or leased to any elementary or secondary school or
School Board, whether the absence of such depiction is the result of
inadvertent omission or the result of any changes in the location and
boundaries of such property which have not yet been incorporated into
a revised approved map, shall not be deemed to be an official finding
and record that such property is not owned by or leased to a school or
School Board or that such property is not used for school purposes.
D. All of the requirements set forth in P.L. 1988, c. 44,12 concerning the
preparation, approval and adoption of the Drug-Free School Zone Map
have been complied with.

general purpose making government records more available to the public
than they have been in the past. In certain instances, the production of

extraordinary time and effort, special equipment or special formatting.
§ 25-2. Ordinary requests for information.
The statutory fee schedule shall apply to routine requests under the Open

herein as such fee schedule presently exists or as such fees might appear
in future modifications or amendments of the statute. At present time, fees
under N.J.S.A. 47:1A-5 for routine copies of municipal documents are:

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 33A-1. Statutory authorization, findings of fact and statement of
purpose.
A. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Council of the Borough of
Merchantville of Camden County, New Jersey does ordain as follows:
B. Findings of Fact:
(1) The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Merchantville are subject
to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which
adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood
heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes
damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed,
§ 33-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 33A-1
1:143
elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute
to the flood loss.
C. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Protect human life and health;
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public;
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas;
(7) Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area
of special flood hazard; and
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
D. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which
result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or
channel flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase flood damage; and,
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood
hazards in other areas.

needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a
conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions).
The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a
reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in
Section 33A-4D.
D. Variance procedure.
(1) Appeal board.
(a) The Joint Land Use Board as established by Borough Council
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from
the requirements of this chapter.
(b) The Joint Land Use Board shall hear and decide appeals when
it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the Borough Clerk in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
(c) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Joint Land Use Board,
or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Superior
Court of New Jersey, as provided by statute.
(d) In passing upon such applications, the Joint Land Use Board,
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
[1] The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others;
[2] The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
[3] The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the
individual owner;
[4] The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
[5] The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
[6] The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
§ 33A-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 33A-4
1:151
[7] The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
[8] The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
[9] The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
[10] The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of
wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and,
[11] The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of
public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems, and streets and bridges.
(e) Upon consideration of the factors of Section 33A-4D(1)(d) and
the purposes of this chapter, the Joint Land Use Board may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
(f) The Borough Clerk shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any
variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon
request.
(2) Conditions for variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half
acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with
existing structures constructed below the base flood level,
providing Section 33A-4D(1)(d) has been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon a determination that the proposed
repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's
continued designation as a historic structure and the variance
is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character
and design of the structure.
(c) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
(d) Variances shall only be issued upon:
[1] A showing of good and sufficient cause;
§ 33A-4 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 33A-4
1:152
§ 33A-5. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
[2] A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and,
[3] A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as
identified Section 33A-4D(1)(d), or conflict with existing
local laws or ordinances.
(e) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built
with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the
increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
A. In all areas of special flood hazards, compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Uniform Construction Code (N.J.A.C. 5:23) and the
following standards, whichever is more restrictive, is required:

(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of
the structure.
(b) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to
be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground
anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable State
and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.
(2) Construction materials and methods.
(a) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to
flood damage.
(b) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood

located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating
within the components during conditions of flooding.
(4) Subdivision proposals.
(a) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(b) All subdivision proposals and other proposed new development
shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,

§ 60A-1. Application; fee; inability to pay.
In order to obtain the services of the Municipal Public Defender or a courtapproved
counsel, an application must be filed with the Municipal Court on
a form provided by the borough. The application form shall be consistent
with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-1 et seq.
§ 60A-2. Use of fees.

PROPERTY MAINTENANCE
A. The Municipal Court Judge shall make the decision as to which
defendants are indigent after reviewing the defendant's application.
This determination shall be based upon whether the applicant fits
within the definition of "indigent defendant" found within N.J.S.A.
2A:158A-2.
B. The Municipal Court Administrator shall assess a nonwaiveable
application fee of $200.00 upon each person from whom an application
for services under this chapter is made. This fee shall be chargeable
regardless of whether the applicant is found to require the services of
the Municipal Public Defender or court-approved counsel. The
Municipal Court Judge may waive any application fee, in whole or in
part, only if the Court determines, in its discretion, upon a clear and
convincing showing by the applicant that the application fee represents
an unreasonable burden upon the applicant.
C. The defendant's inability to pay the application fee shall in no way affect
or reduce the rendering of services under this chapter. In the case of a
defendant who is unable or unwilling to pay the application fee, the fee
shall become a lien and the borough may collect the fee consistent with
N.J.S.A. 40:6A-1 and N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-19.
D. In all cases where it appears that the defendant has, or reasonably
expects to have, means to meet some part, though not all, of the cost of
the services rendered to him, he shall be required to reimburse the
borough, either by single payment or in installments, in such amounts
as the applicant can reasonably be expected to pay over a time period
not to exceed four months. No default or failure in the making of such
payment shall affect or reduce the rendering of services under this
chapter.

Registration of Defaulted Mortgage Property.
[Added 12-12-16 by Ord. No. 2016-17]
§ 60B-24. Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of the Borough Council to establish a process to
address the deterioration, crime and decline in value of the neighborhoods

mortgages located within the Borough, and to identify, regulate, limit and
reduce the number of these properties located within the Borough. It is
the Borough Council's further intent to establish a registration requirement
as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from the negative impact and

§ 71A-27. Scope and purpose.
A. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant reduction through
nonstructural or low impact techniques shall be explored before relying
on structural Best Management Practices (BMPs). Structural BMPs
should be integrated with nonstructural stormwater management
strategies and proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies
include both environmentally sensitive site design and source controls
that prevent pollutants from being placed on the site or from being
exposed to stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based
upon physical site conditions and the origin, nature, and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity, and groundwater
recharge.
B. It is the purpose of this article to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls for "major development," as
defined in Section 71A-28 of this article.
C. Applicability.
(1) This article shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions for
the following major developments that require preliminary or final
site plan or subdivision review:
(a) Nonresidential major developments; and
(b) Aspects of residential major developments that are not
preempted by the Residential Site Improvement Standards at
N.J.A.C. 5:21.
(2) This article shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Merchantville.
D. Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this article are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this article shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This article
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except
that, where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different

(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two (2) or more clear spaces) shall have
an area of no more than seven (7.0) square inches, or be no
greater than two (2.0) inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1), below, are conveyed through
any device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured
treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed,
at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space four and five-eighths (4 5/8)
inches long and one and one-half (1 1/2) inches wide
(this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one (1) inch spacing between the bars,
to the elevation of the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1)below; or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F. and
G. of this section shall be dedicated to a government agency,
subjected to a conservation restriction filed with the appropriate
County Clerk's office, or subject to an approved equivalent
restriction that ensures that measure or an equivalent stormwater
management measure approved by the reviewing agency is
maintained in perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
§ 71A-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71A-30
1:309
address identified in Section 71A-33 of this article, or found on the
Department's website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at Section 71A-31, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100 percent of the average annual
pre-construction groundwater recharge volume for
the site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from pre-construction to post-construction for the
2-year storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to
projects subject to [3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
§ 71A-30 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 71A-30
1:310
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing, or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels; and lubricants, solvents, and detergents
that are related to process, manufacturing, or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at Section 71A-31 of this
article, complete one of the following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that, for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the 2-, 10-, and 100-year storm
events do not exceed, at any point in time, the preconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the 2-, 10, and 100-year
storm events and that the increased volume or change in
timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage
at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the
analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected
land uses assuming full development under existing zoning
and land use ordinances in the drainage area;
§ 71A-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71A-30
1:311
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the 2-, 10-, and 100
year storm events are 50, 75, and 80 percent, respectively,
of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The percentages
apply only to the post-construction stormwater runoff that
is attributable to the portion of the site on which the
proposed development or project is to be constructed. The
percentages shall not be applied to post-construction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard areas, if the
increased volume of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with [1], [2], and [3] above shall
only be applied if the increased volume of stormwater
runoff could increase flood damages below the point of
discharge.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by (80%) percent of the anticipated load from
the developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is one and one-quarter (1.25) inches of rainfall in two (2)
hours. Water quality calculations shall take into account the
distribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as
reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of runoff may
take into account the implementation of nonstructural and
structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2, below,
presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual, and TSS reduction shall be calculated based on
the removal rates listed for the BMPs in Table 2. The BMP Manual
may be obtained from the address identified in Section 71A-33 of
this article, or found on the Department's website at
www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in Section 71A-33 of this article.
Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates
may be used if the design engineer provides documentation
demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and
methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved alternative
rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be provided to
the Department at the following address: Division of Watershed
Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80 percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs, and
A = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = The TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty percent
(80%) TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless
the runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal, while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F. and G. of
this section.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in Section 71A-33 of this
article.
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
§ 71A-30 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 71A-30
1:314
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A 300-foot special water resource protection area shall be
provided on each side of the waterway, measured
perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank
outwards or from the center line of the waterway where
the bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or
vegetation allowed to follow natural succession is
provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under paragraph [1] above shall
only be allowed where previous development or
disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural
use, parking area, or maintained lawn area). The
encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as
measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subparagraph shall be subject to review and approval by
the Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards For
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard For Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within one
hundred fifty (150) feet of the Category One waterway;
§ 71A-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71A-30
1:315
§ 71A-31. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
discharge.
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five (95%) percent TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, then the
provisions of the plan shall be the applicable special water
resource protection area requirements for that waterway. A
stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to
Subsection G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current
functional value and overall condition of the special water
resource protection area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow
the reduction of the Special Water Resource Protection Area to
less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as measured
perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
§ 71A-30 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 71A-31
1:316
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds; or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction
condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a), above, and the
Rational and Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b),
above. A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover
for an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site,
if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has
existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five (5) years
without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than
one land cover has existed on the site during the five (5) years
immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the
lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In
addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good
hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park),
with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good
hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use
type is cultivation).
(3) In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods, may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation, as
defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account
the effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
§ 71A-31 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 71A-31

Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, PO Box 427 Trenton, New Jersey
08625-0427; (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one (1) inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of
the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the
water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure
shall be spaced no greater than one-third (1/3) the width of the
diameter of the orifice or one-third (1/3) the width of the weir, with
a minimum spacing between bars of one (1) inch and a maximum
spacing between bars of six (6) inches. In addition, the design of
trash racks must comply with the requirements of Section 71A-36D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half (2 1/2)
inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
Section 71A-34 of this article.

§ 71A-34. Safety standards for stormwater management basins.
Committee, PO Box 330, Trenton, New Jersey, 08625 (609)
292-5540.
A. This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through
the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins.
This section applies to any new stormwater management basin.
However, the provisions of this section are not intended to preempt
more stringent municipal or county safety requirements for new or
existing stormwater management basins. Municipal and county
stormwater management plans and ordinances may, pursuant to their
authority, require existing stormwater management basins to be
retrofitted to meet one or more of the safety standards in Subsections
B1, B2, and B3 below for trash racks, overflow grates, and escape
provisions at outlet structures.
B. Requirements for trash racks, overflow grates and escape provisions.
(1) A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and
prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be
installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater
management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin
outlets in accordance with the following:
(a) The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than six
(6) inch spacing between the bars.
(b) The trash rack shall be designed so as not to adversely affect
the hydraulic performance of the outlet pipe or structure.
(c) The average velocity of flow through a clean trash rack is not to
exceed two and one-half (2.5) feet per second under the full
range of stage and discharge. Velocity is to be computed on the
basis of the net area of opening through the rack.
(d) The trash rack shall be constructed and installed to be rigid,
durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
withstand a perpendicular live loading of three hundred (300)
PSI.
(2) An overflow grate is designed to prevent obstruction of the
overflow structure. If an outlet structure has an overflow grate,
such grate shall meet the following requirements:
(a) The overflow grate shall be secured to the outlet structure but
removable for emergencies and maintenance.
(b) The overflow grate spacing shall be no less than two (2) inches
across the smallest dimension.
(c) The overflow grate shall be constructed and installed to be
rigid, durable, and corrosion resistant, and shall be designed to
§ 71A-33 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 71A-34
1:320
withstand a perpendicular live loading of three hundred (300)
PSI.
(3) For purposes of this paragraph (3), escape provisions means the
permanent installation of ladders, steps, rungs, or other features
that provide easily accessible means of egress from stormwater
management basins. Stormwater management basins shall include
escape provisions as follows:
(a) If a stormwater management basin has an outlet structure,
escape provisions shall be incorporated in or on the structure.
With the prior approval of the reviewing agency identified in
Section 8C, below, a freestanding outlet structure may be
exempted from this requirement.
(b) Safety ledges shall be constructed on the slopes of all new
stormwater management basins having a permanent pool of
water deeper than two and one-half (2 1/2) feet. Such safety
ledges shall be comprised of two steps. Each step shall be four
to six (4-6) feet in width. One step shall be located
approximately two and one-half (2 1/2) feet below the
permanent water surface, and the second step shall be located
one to one and one-half (1-1 1/2) feet above the permanent
water surface. See Subsection 8D, below, for an illustration of
safety ledges in a stormwater management basin.
(c) In new stormwater management basins, the maximum interior
slope for an earthen dam, embankment, or berm shall not be
steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical.
C. Variance or exemption from safety standards.
(1) A variance or exemption from the safety standards for stormwater
management basins may be granted only upon a written finding by
the appropriate reviewing agency (municipality, county, or
Department) that the variance or exemption will not constitute a
threat to public safety.
D. Illustration of safety ledges in a new stormwater management basin:

§ 71A-35. Requirements for a site development stormwater plan.
A. Submission of site development stormwater plan.
(1) Whenever an applicant seeks municipal approval of a development
subject to this ordinance, the applicant shall submit all of the
required components of the Checklist for the Site Development
Stormwater Plan at Section 71A-35C, below, as part of the
submission of the applicant's application for subdivision or site plan

Such sidewalk assessment shall bear interest from the time of confirmation
at the maximum rate then permissible by law and with the same penalties
for nonpayment as assessments for local improvements in the municipality,
and from confirmation thereof shall be a first and paramount lien upon the
real estate assessed to the same extent and be collected and enforced in
the same manner as assessments for local improvements. The governing
body may provide for the payment and collection of such assessment in
installments in the same manner and at the same rate of interest as
assessments for local improvements are payable in installments in the
municipality. No such assessments shall be invalid by reason or error in the
statement or omission of the name of any owner or owners of real estate
assessed, or for any other informality, where such real estate has actually
been improved. In addition thereto, the borough may have an action to
recover the said amount against the owner of said lands in any court having
competent jurisdiction thereof; a certified copy of the aforesaid certificate
of assessment shall in such action be prima facie evidence of the existence
of a debt due from the said owner or owners to the borough.

A. Any owner of land within or partly within the Borough of Merchantville
shall, prior to subdividing or resubdividing such land, secure approval
of the same by the Merchantville Planning Board before the subdivision
may be recorded in the Office of the Clerk of the County of Camden,
New Jersey. In certain cases involving use variances which are granted
in conjunction with the application for the subdivision, the Zoning
Board of Adjustment shall have jurisdiction for subdivision review and
approval in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-37a. All
references herein to the Planning Board shall apply to the Zoning Board
of Adjustment when it has jurisdiction to hear subdivision applications.
B. Approval of final plans by the Planning Board shall constitute an
acceptance of dedication of land for streets, parks and public purpose
or use. However, such acceptance shall not constitute an acceptance of
physical improvements on such land and shall not impose upon the
borough any obligation for maintenance of or jurisdiction over the
improvements until the improvements have been specifically accepted
by the borough according to law.

approval submitted to the Planning Board or to the Zoning Board of
Adjustment shall be accompanied by proof that no taxes or
assessments for local improvements are due or delinquent on the
property which is the subject of such application; or, if it is shown
that taxes or assessments are delinquent on said property, any
approvals or other relief granted by either Board shall be
conditioned upon either the prompt payment of such taxes or
assessments or the making of adequate provisions for the payment
thereof in such manner that the municipality will be adequately
protected.
A. Applications for minor subdivisions will be submitted with a complete
application form and plat, meeting the following requirements:

apply.
C. Review and approval procedure. If it is determined by the Planning
Board that the application meets all of the zoning requirements and all
of the standards set forth in this chapter or if variances and/or waivers
are granted for specific requirements and/or standards, the Planning
Board shall grant approval of the plat, with any conditions determined
to be appropriate to the granting of such approval. Minor subdivision
approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days of the date of
submission of a complete application to the administrative officer, or
within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant.
Failure of the Planning Board to act within the period prescribed shall
constitute minor subdivision approval, and a certificate of the
administrative officer as to the failure of the Planning Board to act shall
be issued on request of the applicant; and it shall be sufficient in lieu of
the written endorsement or other evidence of approval, as required
under the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., and shall be so
accepted by the County Recording officer for purposes of filing
subdivision plats.
D. Requirements for recording with Register of Deeds.
(1) Approval of a minor subdivision shall expire 190 days from the date
on which the resolution of municipal approval is adopted unless
within such period a plat in conformity with such approval and the
provisions of the Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), or a
deed clearly describing the approved minor subdivision, is filed by
the developer with the County Recording Officer, the Municipal
Engineer and the Municipal Tax Assessor. Any such plat or deed
accepted for such filing shall have been signed by the Chairman
and Secretary of the Planning Board. In reviewing the application
for development for a proposed minor subdivision, the Planning
Board may accept a plat not in conformity with the Map Filing Law
(N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), provided that if the developer chooses
to file minor subdivision as provided herein by plat rather than
deed, such plat shall conform with the provisions of said law.
(2) The Planning Board may extend the one-hundred-ninety-day period
for filing a minor subdivision plat or deed pursuant to Subsection
D(1) above if the developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of
the Planning Board that the developer was barred or prevented,
§ 73A-5 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 73A-5
1:348
§ 73A-6. Major subdivision.
Where an application has been classified as a major subdivision, the
subdivider shall submit to the Zoning Official the following material for
review and approval of applicant's plat:
directly or indirectly, from filing because of delays in obtaining
legally required approvals from other governmental or quasigovernmental
entities, and that the developer applied promptly for
and diligently pursued the required approvals. The length of the
extension shall be equal to the period of delay caused by the wait
for the required approvals, as determined by the Planning Board.
The developer may apply for the extension either before or after
what would otherwise be the expiration date.
E. Effect of approval.
(1) The zoning requirements and general terms and conditions,
whether conditional or otherwise, upon which minor subdivision
approval was granted, shall not be changed for a period of two
years after the date on which the resolution was adopted, provided
that the approved minor subdivision shall be duly recorded as
provided herein.
(2) The Planning Board shall grant an extension of minor subdivision
approval for a period determined by the Board, but not exceeding
one year from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the
developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
proceeding with the development because of delays in obtaining
legally required approvals from other governmental entities and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the
required approvals. A developer shall apply for the extension
before what would otherwise be the expiration date of a minor
subdivision approval, or the 91st day after the developer receives
the last legally required approval from other governmental entities,
whichever occurs later.
A. Preliminary plats.
(1) Plat requirements. Original linen or Mylar tracing and 16 copies of
the subdivision plat in the form of a map or a series of maps drawn
to scale not smaller than 50 feet to the inch, and showing, in
addition to the requirements of the minor subdivision plat, the
following:
(a) The limits and dimensions of the tract to be subdivided and its
identifying numbers on the Borough Tax Map, showing also the
location of the proposed subdivision in relation to the nearby
properties and also the names and addresses of property
owners within 200 feet of the tract boundary.

1:349
(b) Existing and proposed streets, including names and widths of
the right-of-way and cartway.
(c) The location and dimensions, where applicable, of existing
buildings, easements, rights-of-way, public lands, tree masses,
streams and other such features, and monuments.
(d) The location and dimensions of proposed easements, rights-ofway,
and lands reserved for public purposes.
(e) Existing topographic contours at not more than two-foot
intervals. The plat shall also show proposed final contours.
(f) The name of the subdivider and the name, seal and signature of
the licensed professional engineer or surveyor qualified to
practice in New Jersey who prepared the plot.
(g) A summary table of the number and type (i.e., single-family,
two-family, etc.) of structures and dwelling units proposed,
which shall be included on the plat.
(h) Proposed improvements, including streets, curbs, gutters,
sidewalks and stormwater management systems.
(i) A summary table showing conformity with zoning standards.
Each lot shall show minimum setback lines.
(2) Review procedure.
(a) The Zoning Official shall notify the Chairman of the Planning
Board within five business days of the submittal of applications
and shall transmit them as the Chairman may direct. At its next
regular meeting, as advised by the Zoning Official, the
Planning Board may docket the application for hearing.
(b) Following a determination of completeness of the application
and before public hearing thereon, the applicant shall cause
lawful notice and advertisement of the hearing to be made and
shall, at least 10 days before the hearing, file the plats and
pertinent papers and reports in the office of the Borough Clerk
for public inspection upon request. Publication and notice shall
be made pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-12. Proof
of notification and advertising shall be furnished to the
Planning Board at the time of the hearing. Before the hearing,
the Planning Board shall circulate copies of the plans among
the officials of the borough charged with enforcement of
building, zoning, engineering, sanitation, and other pertinent
regulations, including Police and Fire Departments.
(c) Upon the submission to the administrative officer of a complete
application for a subdivision of 10 or fewer lots, the Planning
Board shall grant or deny preliminary approval within 45 days
of the date of such submission or within such further time as
§ 73A-6 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 73A-6
1:350
may be consented to by the developer. Upon the submission of
a complete application for a subdivision of more than 10 lots,
the Planning Board shall grant or deny preliminary approval
within 95 days of the date of such submission or within such
further time as may be consented to by the developer.
Otherwise, the Planning Board shall be deemed to have
granted preliminary approval to the subdivision.
(d) After or at the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning
Board shall approve the plans, subject to the conditions
specified at the hearing, included but not limited to the
requirements of §§ 73A-4, 73A-7 and 73A-8 of this chapter, or
disapprove them. If the Planning Board requires any
substantial amendment to the layout of improvements
proposed by the developer that have been subject of a hearing,
an amended application shall be submitted and proceeded
upon, as in the case of the original application for
development. The Planning Board shall, if the proposed
subdivision complies with this chapter and the provisions of
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq., grant preliminary approval to the
subdivision. If the Board wishes to impose conditions not
specified at a previous public hearing, a new hearing shall be
held to discuss said conditions. The Planning Board's action
shall be noted or stamped on all copies of the subdivision plat,
together with a statement of any conditions or required
changes and modifications. Such statement of conditions shall
be deemed to be as much part of the plat as if they had been
originally submitted by the subdivider.
(e) Preliminary approval of a major subdivision shall, except as
provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49d, confer upon the applicant the
following rights for a three-year period from the date on which
the resolution of preliminary approval is adopted:
[1] That the general terms and conditions on which the
preliminary approval was granted shall not be changed,
including but not limited to use requirements; layout and
design standards for streets, curbs and sidewalks; lot size;
yard dimensions and off-tract improvements; except that
nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the borough
from modifying by ordinance such general terms and
conditions of preliminary approval as relate to public
health and safety.
[2] That the applicant may submit for final approval on or
before the expiration date of preliminary approval the
whole or a section or sections of the preliminary
subdivision plat.
[3] That the applicant may apply for and the Planning Board
may grant extensions on such preliminary approval for
§ 73A-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 73A-6
1:351
additional periods of at least one year but not to exceed
a total extension of two years, provided that if the design
standards have been revised by the ordinance, such
revised standards may govern.
[4] Whenever the Planning Board grants an extension of
preliminary approval pursuant to Subsection A(2)(e)[3]
above and preliminary approval has expired before the
date on which the extension is granted, the extension shall
begin on what would otherwise be the expiration date. The
developer may apply for the extension either before or
after what would otherwise be the extension date.
[5] The Planning Board shall grant an extension of preliminary
approval for a period determined by the Board but not
exceeding one year from what would otherwise be the
expiration date, if the developer proves to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the
development because of delays in obtaining legally
required approvals from other governmental entities and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently
pursued the required approvals. A developer shall apply
for the extension before what would otherwise be the
expiration date of preliminary approval or the 91st day
after the developer receives the last legally required
approval from other governmental entities, whichever
occurs later. An extension granted pursuant to this
subsection shall not preclude the Planning Board from
granting an extension pursuant to Subsection A(2)(c)[3]
herein.
(f) After action by the Planning Board, the following distribution
of the subdivision plat copies and supporting materials shall be
made: one copy of each of the materials, including the
statement of conformity to other regulations, shall be retained
by the Planning Board; one copy of each of the remaining
materials shall be returned to the subdivider; and one copy of
these materials shall be transmitted to the Borough Council for
its information and also to serve as a basis upon which the
subdivider shall make necessary arrangements. One additional
copy of these materials is provided for work and miscellaneous
purposes.
B. Final plats.
(1) Plan requirements. The applicant shall submit final subdivision
plans and supporting materials to the Zoning Official with the
application for approval of the final plats. Final plats shall conform
in all important details with preliminary plats as approved by the
Planning Board and must be submitted within three years of the
§ 73A-6 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 73A-6
1:352
date of approval of the preliminary plats, or such other period that
shall be extended by the Board pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49. If
final approval is requested for a portion of an approved preliminary
subdivision plat, the applicant may proceed with the development
in stages, provided that adequate proofs are submitted to the
Planning Board that at each stage of development the project
can function effectively and conform to the requirements of this
chapter and Chapter 94, Zoning, if no further development takes
place. Where substantial changes have been made in the final plats
not conforming to the preliminary plats as approved, such revised
plats shall be treated as preliminary plats submitted for the first
time. Final plats shall be approved by the Borough Planning Board
and its engineers before the subdivider may record the plats in
the office of the County Clerk of Camden County. Any conditions
specified in the approval of preliminary plans shall be incorporated
into the final plans. The following materials shall be submitted by
the subdivider:
(a) Original linen or Mylar tracing, cloth duplicate, and 13 paper
prints of the subdivision plat in the form of a map or a series of
maps drawn to scale not smaller than 50 feet to the inch. Such
map or maps shall be made on permanent materials. One copy
shall be made on translucent tracing cloth with permanent
black ink and one copy shall be a cloth print duplicate thereof;
both of these copies shall be suitable for recordation according
to the provisions of the laws of the State of New Jersey. Of the
remaining copies, one shall be a cloth-print duplicate and 12
shall be black-and-white paper prints. The error of closure
shall not be more than one part in 5,000. The final subdivision
plats not for recordation shall show:
[1] The items required to be shown in preliminary subdivision
plats, as specified in § 73A-6A(1).
[2] Final topographic contours at not more than two-foot
intervals.
[3] The location of all proposed monuments and street signs.
(b) Two copies of utility map or maps showing tract boundaries,
existing and proposed streets, lot lines, sanitary and storm
water sewer facilities, water pipes, curbs, sidewalks, fire
hydrants and manholes.
(c) Two copies of profile and cross-section maps or diagrams of
streets showing proposed grades of curbs, sanitary and
stormwater sewers, water pipes and any other underground
utilities.
(d) One copy of any deed restrictions affecting the subdivision of
the property or a written statement by the subdivider that
there are no such restrictions.
§ 73A-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 73A-6
1:353
(e) One copy of a statement of the type or types of structures to be
erected, and a summary table of the number of structures and
dwelling units proposed.
(f) A certification by the Borough Engineer that any required
improvements which may have been installed before final plan
approval have been installed in accordance with borough
procedures, specifications and standards.
(g) Evidence that the subdivider has furnished to the borough:
[1] A written agreement, concerning improvements not yet
completed or not yet adequately installed in a form
provided by the borough, that the subdivider will lay out
and improve roads and streets and construct all of the
improvements, including necessary grading of the entire
street rights-of- way, paving, curbs, gutters and other
improvements, including sidewalks, sewers, street trees,
street name signs, monuments, crosswalks, fire hydrants
and all other related improvements and facilities which
may be required as a condition of the approval of the plan
by the Borough Planning Board, within the time or times
herein specified.
[2] A bond in such amount, under such conditions and form
and with surety as shall be approved by the governing
body to guarantee the performance of the subdivider's
undertaking in Subsection B(1)(g)[1] above, and secure
the completion of the improvements within the time
therein specified, and a written agreement that, upon
acceptance of any streets or improvements, whether
installed before or after final plan approval, the subdivider
shall provide a maintenance bond not exceeding 15% of
the full cost of all improvements under such conditions, in
form and with surety as shall be approved by the
governing body to guarantee the maintenance of the
streets and public improvements, including grading,
paving, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street lights, street
signs, sewers and crosswalks, for a period of up to two
years from the date of acceptance of said improvements by
the borough. In lieu of a bond, the subdivider may deposit
cash or securities with the borough or with a bank or trust
company to guarantee performance of said contract and to
secure completion of the improvements under an escrow
agreement provided by the Borough Solicitor and the
governing body. The escrow agent for the deposits of such
cash or securities shall be designated by the governing
body.
§ 73A-6 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 73A-6
1:354
[3] An agreement that the subdivider will install curbs and
underground facilities before paving streets and
constructing sidewalks.
[4] The developer shall reimburse the municipality for all
reasonable inspection fees paid to the Municipal Engineer
for the inspection of improvements required as part of the
subdivision approval; provided that the borough may
require of the developer a deposit for all or a portion of the
reasonably anticipated fees to be paid to the municipal
engineer for such inspection. For those developments for
which reasonably anticipated fees are $10,000.00 or
greater, fees may, at the option of the developer, be paid in
four installments. The initial amount deposited by a
developer shall be 25% of the reasonably anticipated fees.
When the balance on deposit drops to 10% of the
reasonably anticipated fees because the amount deposited
by the developer has been reduced by the amount paid to
the Municipal Engineer for inspection, the developer shall
make additional deposits of 25% of the reasonably
anticipated fees. The Municipal Engineer shall not perform
any inspection if sufficient funds to pay for those
inspections are not on deposit. In the event that final
approval is by stages or sections of development pursuant
to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-38, the provisions of this section shall
be applied by stage or section.
(2) Review procedure.
(a) One copy of each subdivision plat and one copy of utility maps
and street profiles received by the Secretary of the Planning
Board shall be transmitted to the Borough Engineer for his
review and report to the Planning Board. Nine copies of the
subdivision plats and one copy of all supporting materials shall
be sent directly to the Planning Board for its review.
(b) The Borough Engineer shall, within two weeks, review plans
and transmit such plans with a report, in writing, to the
Planning Board.
(c) Approval by the Planning Board shall be noted or stamped on
all copies of the subdivision plat. If the Planning Board
disapproves the plat, the findings and reasons for such
disapproval shall be stated upon the records of the Planning
Board, and the applicant shall be given a copy.
(d) Final approval shall be granted or denied within 45 days after
submission of a complete application to the administrative
officer, or within such further time as may be consented to by
the applicant. Failure of the Planning Board to act within the
period prescribed shall constitute final approval, and a
§ 73A-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 73A-6
1:355
certificate of the administrative officer as to the failure of
the Planning Board to act shall be issued on request of the
applicant, and it shall be sufficient in lieu of the written
endorsement or other evidence of approval herein required,
and shall be so accepted by the County Recording Officer
for purposes of filing subdivision plats. Whenever review or
approval of the application by the County Planning Board is
required, the Merchantville Planning Board shall condition any
approval that it grants upon a timely receipt of a favorable
report on the application by the County Planning Board or
approval by the County Planning Board by its failure to report
thereon within the required time period.
(e) Effect of final approval of a major subdivision.
[1] The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary
approval first granted and all other rights conferred upon
the developer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49, whether
conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a
period of two years after the date on which the resolution
of final approval is adopted; provided that in the case of a
major subdivision, the rights conferred by this section
shall expire if the plat has not been duly recorded within
the time period provided in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-54. If the
developer has followed the standards prescribed for final
approval, and has duly recorded the plat as required in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-54, the Planning Board may extend such
period of protection of extensions of one year, but not to
exceed three extensions. Notwithstanding other provisions
of this act, the granting of final approval terminates the
time period of preliminary approval pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-49 for the section granted final approval.
[2] Whenever the Planning Board grants an extension of final
approval pursuant to Subsection B(2)(e)[1] of this section
and final approval has expired before the date on which
the extension is granted, the extension shall begin on what
would otherwise be the expiration date. The developer
may apply for the extension either before or after what
would otherwise be the expiration date.
[3] The Planning Board shall grant an extension of final
approval for a period determined by the Board, but not
exceeding one year from what would otherwise be the
expiration date, if the developer proves to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or
prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the
development because of delays in obtaining legally
required approvals from other governmental entities and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently
pursued these approvals. A developer shall apply for the
§ 73A-6 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 73A-6
1:356
extension before what would otherwise be the expiration
date of final approval, or the 91st day after the developer
receives the last legally required approval from other
governmental entities, whichever occurs later. An
extension granted pursuant to this subsection shall not
preclude the Planning Board from granting an extension
pursuant to Subsection B(2)(e)[1] of this section.
(f) Distribution of copies of the subdivision plat, as finally
approved, shall be as follows: one to the Planning Board, one to
the Borough Engineer, one to be retained by the Borough Clerk
for borough files, one to the Assessor, one to the Zoning Official
and one to the subdivider. One copy of all supporting materials
shall be retained in the borough files.
(g) The Borough Engineer shall not make his certification on the
final plats for filing at the County Clerk's office until the
Planning Board shall have granted approval.
(3) Requirements for recording with Register of Deeds.
(a) Final approval of a major subdivision shall expire 95 days from
the date of signing of the plat unless within such period the
plat shall have been duly filed by the developer with the County
Recording Officer. The Planning Board may, for good cause
shown, extend the period for recording for an additional period
not to extend 190 days from the date of the signing of the plat.
The Planning Board may extend the ninety-five-day or onehundred-
ninety-day period if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Planning Board that the
developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
filing because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals
from other governmental or quasi-governmental entities, and
that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued
the required approvals. The length of the extension shall be
equal to the period of delay caused by the wait for the required
approvals, and determined by the Planning Board. The
developer may apply for an extension either before or after the
original expiration date.
(b) No subdivision plat shall be accepted for filing by the County
Recording Officer until it has been approved by the Planning
Board as indicated on the instrument by the signature of the
Chairman and the Secretary of the Planning Board or a
certificate has been issued pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-47,
40:55D-50, 40:55D-56, 40:55D-61, 40:55D-67 or 40:55D-76.
The signatures of the Chairman and Secretary of the Planning
Board shall not be affixed until the developer has posted the
guaranties required pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. If the
County Recording Officer records any plat without such
approval, such recording shall be deemed null and void, and

preliminary or minor subdivision approval, shall have the power to grant
such exceptions from the requirements for subdivision approval as may
be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the provisions

(10) Such other pertinent information as the Borough Council may
require.
C. Exemptions and abatements on residential dwellings.
(1) Exemptions. With regard to the exemption from taxation of
improvements to dwellings, in determining the value of real
property, the Borough shall regard the first $25,000 in Assessor's
full and true value of improvements for each dwelling unit primarily
and directly affected by the improvement in any dwelling more than
20 years old as not increasing the value of the property for a period
of five years, notwithstanding that the value of the property to
which the improvements are made is increased thereby. During the
exemption period, the assessment on the property shall not be less
than the assessment thereon existing immediately prior to the
improvements, unless an abatement is granted pursuant to
Subsection C(2) of this section, or there is damage to the dwelling
through action of the elements sufficient to warrant a reduction.
(2) Abatements for improvements. The Borough Council may abate
some portion of the assessed value of property receiving the
abatement as it existed immediately prior to the improvement. An
abatement for a dwelling may be granted with respect to that
property for a total of up to five years, but the annual amount of the
abatement granted to any single property shall not exceed 30% of
the annual amount of the abatement granted under this article. The
abatement period and the annual percentage of the abatement to
be granted shall be set forth in the specific ordinance, which may
§ 77-1 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 77-1
1:368
include a schedule providing for a different percentage of
abatement up to 30% for each year of the abatement period.
(3) Abatement for new construction and/or conversions. The Borough
Council may abate some portion of the assessed valuation of
construction of new dwellings or of conversions of other buildings
and structures, including unutilized public buildings, to dwelling
use, or both. In determining the value of real property, the
municipality shall regard a percentage, not to exceed 30% of the
Assessor's full and true value of the dwelling constructed, or
conversion alterations made, as not increasing the value of the
property for a total up to five years, notwithstanding that the value
of the property upon which the construction or conversion occurs is
increased thereby. The abatement period and the annual
percentage of the abatement to be granted shall be set forth in the
specific ordinance, which may include a schedule providing for a
different percentage of abatement, up to 30%, for each year of the
abatement period.
(4) Joint abatement and exemption. A project-specific ordinance
providing for exemption may also provide for the abatement of
some portion of the assessed value of property receiving the
abatement of 30% as it existed immediately prior to the
improvement or conversion alteration. The annual amount of the
abatement shall not exceed 30% of the total cost of the
improvement or conversion alteration, and the total amount of
abatement and exemption granted to any single property shall not
exceed the total cost of the improvement or conversion alteration.
The abatement period and the annual percentage of the abatement
to be granted shall be set forth in the specific ordinance, which may
include a schedule providing for a different percentage or
abatement, up to 30%, for each year of the abatement period.
D. Exemptions and abatements on commercial and industrial structures.
(1) With regard to the exemption from taxation of improvements to
commercial or industrial structures, in determining the value of
real property, the municipality shall regard up to the Assessor's full
and true value of the improvements as not increasing the value of
the property for a period of five years, notwithstanding that the
value of the property to which the improvements are made is
increased thereby. During the exemption period, the assessment on
the property shall not be less than the assessment thereon existing
immediately prior to the improvements, unless there is damage to
the structure through action of the elements sufficient to warrant a
reduction.
(2) With regard to exemptions and/or abatements for any
improvements other than single-family residential property, the
Borough shall authorize exemption for improvements on an
§ 77-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 77-1
1:369
§ 77-2. Additional improvements, conversion and/or construction;
eligibility for exemption and abatement. [Amended 3-25-2019 by
Ord. No. 19-02]
An additional improvement, conversion or construction completed on a
property granted a previous exemption or abatement pursuant to this
article during the period in which such previous exemption or abatement is
in effect shall be qualified for an exemption, or exemption and abatement,
just as if such property had not received a previous exemption or
abatement. In such a case, the additional improvement, conversion or
construction shall be considered as separate for the purposes of calculating
exemptions and abatements pursuant to this article, except that the
assessed value of any previous improvement, conversion or construction
shall be added to the assessed valuation as it was prior to that improvement,
conversion, alteration or construction for the purpose of determining the
assessed valuation of the property from which any additional abatement is
to be subtracted.
§ 77-3. Long-term tax exemption. [Amended 3-25-2019 by Ord. No.

A. It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor or utility wishing
to conduct work on, under or above the roadway to contact the
Merchantville Police Department in order to arrange a preconstruction
meeting to submit plans for the safe movement of traffic during such

violation of this section.
B. The person, contractor or utility shall provide the Merchantville Police
Department with at least two emergency contact phone numbers to be
called in case of emergency problems at the construction or
maintenance site prior to the start of any work. If, for any reason,

safety or health hazard, the work shall then be permitted only between
9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m.

§ 94-51.5 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 94-51.7
1:512
§ 94-51.7. Standards for review by Historic Preservation
Commission.
A. In regard to all applications, the Commission shall be guided by the
following standards:
(1) Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building,
structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its
originally intended purpose.
(2) The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The
removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive
architectural features should be avoided when possible.
(3) All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products
of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and
which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
(4) Changes which may have taken place in the course of time are
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or
site and its environment. These changes may have acquired
significance in their own right, and this significance shall be
recognized and respected.
(5) Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship
which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
(6) Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible. In the event that replacement is
necessary, the new material should match the material being
replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual
qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features
should be based on accurate duplication of features, substantiated
by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on
conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural
elements from other buildings or structures.
(7) The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods
that will damage the historic building materials shall not be
undertaken.
(8) Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any project.
(9) Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and
additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or
cultural materials and when such design is compatible with the
§ 94-51.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 94-51.7
1:513
size, scale, color, material and character of the property,
neighborhood or environment.
(10) Wherever possible, new additions and alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations
were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity
of the structure would be unimpaired.
B. In regard to applications for new construction, additions and
alterations, the following visual compatibility factors shall be
considered:
(1) Height. The height of the proposed building shall be visually
compatible with adjacent buildings.
(2) The proportion of a building's front facade. The relationship of the
width of the building to the height of the front elevation shall be
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(3) The proportion of openings within the facility. The relationship of
the width of the windows to the height of the windows in a building
shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which
it is visually related.
(4) The rhythm of solids to voids in front facades. The relationship of
solids to voids in the front facade of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(5) The rhythm of spacing and buildings on streets. The relationship of
the building to the open space between it and adjoining buildings
shall be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which
it is visually related.
(6) The rhythm of entrance and/or porch projections. The relationship
of the entrance and porch projections to the street shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and places to which it is visually
related.
(7) The relationship of materials, texture and color. The relationship of
the materials, texture and color of the facade and roof of a building
shall be visually compatible with the predominant materials used in
the buildings to which it is visually related.
(8) Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building shall be visually
compatible with the buildings to which it is visually related.
(9) Walls of continuity. Appurtenances of a building such as walls,
open-type fencing and evergreen landscape masses shall form
cohesive walls of enclosure along a street to the extent necessary
to maintain visual compatibility of the building with the buildings
and places to which it is visually related.
§ 94-51.7 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 94-51.7
1:514
(10) The scale of a building. The size of a building, the mass of a
building in relation to open spaces, the windows, door openings,
porches and balconies shall be visually compatible with the
buildings and places to which it is visually related.
(11) The directional expression of the front elevation. A building shall
be visually compatible with the buildings and places to which it is
visually related in its directional character, whether this be vertical
character, horizontal character or nondirectional character.
(12) Exterior features. A structure's related exterior features, such as
lighting, fences, signs, sidewalks, driveways and parking areas,
shall be compatible with the features of those structures to which it
is visually related and shall be appropriate for the historic period
for which the structure is significant.
C. In regard to applications for demolition, the following matters shall be
considered:
(1) Its historic, architectural, cultural or scenic significance in relation
to the criteria established in this article.
(2) If it is within an Historic District, its significance to the Historic
District and the probable impact of its demolition on the character
and ambience of the Historic District and the criteria which were
the basis of the designation of the Historic District.
(3) Its potential for use for those purposes currently permitted by the
Zoning Ordinance.
(4) Its structural condition and the economic feasibility of alternatives
to the proposal.
(5) Its importance to the Borough and the extent to which its historical
or architectural value is such that its demolition would be
detrimental to the public interest.
(6) The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design,
craftsmanship, texture or material that it would not be reproduced
or could be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense.
(7) The extent to which its retention would promote the general
welfare by maintaining and increasing the real estate values,
generating business, attracting tourists, attracting new residents,
stimulating interest and study in architecture and design or making
the Borough an attractive and desirable place in which to live.
(8) Whether the property can be put to reasonable beneficial use
without the approval of the demolition application. The
Commission may ask applicants for additional information to be
used in making this determination.

1:515
§ 94-51.8. Effect of approval or denial by Historic Preservation
Commission; appeals.
D. In regard to applications for removal, the following matters shall be
considered:
(1) The historic loss to the site of the original location and, if the
present location is within an Historic District, to the Historic
District as a whole.
(2) The reasons for not retaining the landmark or structure at its
present site.
(3) The compatibility, nature and character of the current and of the
proposed surrounding areas as they relate to the protection of the
interest and values referred to in this article.
(4) If the proposed new location is within an Historic District, visual
compatibility factors as set forth in Subsection B of this section.
(5) The probability of significant damage to the landmark or structure
itself.
(6) If it is to be removed from the Borough, the proximity of the
proposed new location to the Borough, including the accessibility
to the residents of the Borough and other citizens.
A. Approval: Issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be deemed
to be final approval pursuant to this Article VIIIB. Such approval shall
neither cause nor prevent the filing of any collateral application or
other proceeding required by any other Borough ordinance to be made
prior to undertaking the Regulated Activity concerning the Historic Site
or the structure in an Historic District or the demolition.
B. Denial: Denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be deemed to
preclude the applicant from undertaking the Regulated Activity or
demolition applied for.
C. Postponement of demolition: In its review of applications for demolition,
the Commission may recommend the postponement of demolition for a
period not to exceed one (1) year. The Commission shall utilize this time
period to consult with the governing body, the New Jersey Department
of Environmental Protection and Energy or other similarly qualified
organizations to ascertain how the Borough may preserve the site or
improvement to be demolished. The Commission shall be empowered to
assist the owner in developing plans to preserve the site or
improvement when moving or demolition would be a great loss to the
Borough.
D. Appeals: The granting or the denial of a Certificate of Appropriateness
and/or the action of the Zoning Officer and/or Construction Official in
reliance upon same may be appealed to the Planning Board in the same
§ 94-51.7 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 94-51.8
1:516
§ 94-51.9. Enforcement; violation; notice; failure to comply.
manner as an appeal is taken pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-72. Nothing
herein shall be deemed to limit the right of judicial review of the
Borough action after an appeal is concluded by the Planning Board.
A. Any person who shall undertake any Regulated Activity which affects an
Historic Site or an improvement within an Historic District or removes
or demolishes a building or structure which requires a Certificate of
Appropriateness, without obtaining the approval of the Commission,
shall be deemed to be in violation of this article.
B. Upon learning of the violation, the Zoning Officer and/or Construction
Official shall personally serve upon the owner of the property whereon
the violation is occurring a notice describing the violation in detail and
giving the owner ten (10) days to abate the violation by restoring the
site or improvement to the condition it was in prior to the violation. If
the owner cannot be personally served within the Borough with said
notice, a copy shall be posted on the site and a copy sent to the owner at
his last known address as it appears on the Borough tax rolls.
C. In the event that the violation is not abated within ten (10) days of
service or posting on site, whichever is earlier, the Zoning Officer and/
or Construction Official shall cause to be instituted any appropriate
action or proceeding to prevent such unlawful activity; to restrain,
correct or abate such violation; to prevent the occupancy of said site or
improvement; or to prevent any illegal act, conduct, business or use in
or about such site or improvement.
D. If any person shall undertake any Regulated Activity or shall remove or
demolish a building or structure requiring a Certificate of
Appropriateness without first having obtained approval, he or she shall
be required to immediately stop the activity, apply for approval and take
any necessary measures to preserve the site or improvement affected,
pending a decision. If the Certificate of Appropriateness is denied, he or
she shall immediately restore the site or improvement to its pre-activity
status. The Zoning Officer and/or Construction Official is hereby
authorized to seek injunctive relief regarding a stop action on
restoration in the Superior Court, Chancery Division, not less than ten
(10) days after the delivery of notice pursuant to Subsection B hereof.
E. In the event that any regulated activity or demolition or removal of a
building or structure that requires a Certificate of Appropriateness
which would permanently and adversely change a property is about to
occur without approval having been issued, the Zoning Officer and/or
Construction Official is empowered to apply to the Superior Court of
New Jersey for injunctive relief as is necessary to prevent such actions.

B. General regulations.
(1) Allowed signs. Overhanging signs, building face signs, window and
door glass signs, freestanding signs, temporary signs, directional
signs and traffic control signs are allowed as specifically provided
herein.
(2) Restrictions applying to all allowed signs.
(a) Signs may be placed only on the principal frontage of a
building facing a public street or public parking lot having a
principal entrance used by the public. The use of allowable
signs by first floor uses and by those uses which lie above or
below the first floor are limited as specifically set forth herein.
A first floor use located at the intersection of two (2) public
§ 94-56.2 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 94-57
1:528
streets shall be allowed to place signs on each of the two
(2) street frontages, with each street frontage regulated
separately.
(b) Total area. The total area of all signs on each street frontage
shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the width of the street
facade of the building multiplied by twelve (12) feet. [e.g., a
building which is twenty-five (25) feet in width at the street
frontage is multiplied by ten percent (10%), resulting in two
and one-half (2 1/2) feet, which is then multiplied by twelve
(12) feet, yielding a total allowable sign area of thirty (30)
square feet.] Where there are multiple tenants on the first floor
of a building, the sign area limitation shall apply to that portion
of the first floor street frontage which is occupied by the use
which proposes the sign. Directional signs which are less than
three (3) square feet and traffic control signs which conform to
New Jersey Department of Transportation requirements shall
be permitted but shall not be included in the calculation of
total sign area.
[1] The area of a sign shall be calculated by multiplying its
greatest width by its greatest height, including any frame
but exclusive of any device solely providing support. For
signs which consist of letters or other graphics applied
directly to a building surface, the area shall be calculated
by enclosing the letters or other graphics with the smallest
rectangle which can contain all the letters or other
graphics and calculating the area of the rectangle by
multiplying its width by its height.
[2] A registered trademark, logo or iconographic sign shall be
a part of the sign or separate from the principal sign as a
second sign. The area of this type of display shall be
considered as a part of total sign area allowed and shall be
determined by enclosing it with the smallest rectangle
which can contain the display and calculating the area of
the rectangle by multiplying its width by its height. This
separate calculation of sign area for a trademark, logo or
iconographic sign can be applied even if the display item is
an integral part of a single sign with other information.
[3] Two-sided signs shall be measured by using the surface of
one (1) side only. Signs with more than two (2) sides shall
be measured by using the surface of the greatest number
of sides which is visible at one (1) time.
(c) Professionally made signs only. Only signs created and built by
professional sign fabricators are allowed.
§ 94-57 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 94-57
1:529
(d) Illumination of signs. Signs with internal illumination are not
allowed. Only external illumination of signs by incandescent
flood lamps is allowed.
(e) Sign content. The sign copy or message allowed on signs is
limited to the following:
[1] Primary copy:
[a] The registered name of the business.
[b] The names of the owners or proprietors.
[c] An identification of the trade or type of business.
[2] Secondary copy at a smaller size, such as:

[b] The telephone number.
(f) Lettering style and sign graphics. Lettering for primary copy
shall be of a serif, script or other decorative lettering style.
Lettering for secondary copy may be of any lettering style.
(g) Materials for signs. Signs shall be made of durable materials
such as steel, bronze, copper, aluminum, painted or preserved
wood or other material which can be shown to be durable.
Plastic may be used for incidental components of signs,
including applied letters and graphics or as a facing applied to
a panel of a durable material. Plastic may be used for
structural components of signs or for panels forming or
supporting the sign's display area, provided that the plastic is
shown to be durable, suited for the intended use and
compatible in appearance and intent with the durable
materials listed in the first sentence of this subsection.
(h) Structural requirements. All signs shall be of sound
construction and shall be permanently affixed to either the
ground or building, as defined for each particular allowable
sign, in a manner conforming with the New Jersey Uniform
Construction Code.
(i) Maintenance. All signs shall be periodically maintained by the
owner of said signs in order to assure that the signs are not
dangerous to the safety of others. If a sign is determined to be
unsafe by an enforcement official of the Borough of
Merchantville, it shall be repaired by the owner of said sign
within fourteen (14) days of a notice requiring said repair.
Otherwise, said unsafe sign shall be immediately removed by
the owner. If said unsafe sign is not removed by the owner, the
borough shall be empowered to remove said sign and to assess
the owner of said sign an administrative fee of one hundred
§ 94-57 MERCHANTVILLE CODE § 94-57
1:530
dollars ($100.), a sign removal fee of an additional one hundred
dollars ($100) and those fines which are otherwise authorized
by this chapter. Signs which do not conform with the
requirements of this chapter and which are in an unsafe
condition and cannot be repaired or which have been displaced
from their structural supports shall not be permitted to be
restored or replaced unless they are brought into compliance
with the standards of this chapter.
(j) Abandoned uses. All signs and their related supporting
structures which pertain to a use or business which is no
longer in existence or operation at that location shall be
removed within thirty (30) days from the date said use or
business ceases to exist or operate. If said signs are not
removed by the owner, the borough shall be empowered to
remove said signs and to assess the owner of said signs an
administrative fee of one hundred dollars ($100.), a sign
removal fee of an additional one hundred dollars ($100) and
those fines which are otherwise authorized by this chapter.
Subsequent uses or businesses shall make an application for a
new sign. All variances granted from this code, or
nonconforming characteristics of the preexisting sign, shall not
be allowed to continue or apply to any new signs. This shall
apply whether or not a prior owner has complied with this
regulation by removing the preexisting sign.
(k) Real estate signs. Real estate signs are permitted in the B-1 or
B-2 District in accordance with the following requirements:
[1] They shall not be illuminated.
[2] They shall not pertain to any property other than the one

or moving signs of any type or signs which present an illusion
of movement are prohibited. Signs which incorporate a clock
with conventionally moving hands and signs which incorporate
digital time and temperature displays are permitted as part of
an otherwise allowable sign as set forth herein, and the sign
area for the portion of the sign which includes such an item
shall be computed in the same manner as a sign that
incorporates a logo.

§ 94-101. Standards for review.
In addition to the requirements of this chapter and of the Merchantville
Master Plan, as amended, the following standards shall be used by the
Planning Board as guidelines in reviewing site plan applications:
A. The existing landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as
possible and tree and soil removal kept to a minimum. Grade changes
shall be made in keeping with the general appearance of neighboring
developed areas. New landscaping and grass and ground cover areas
shall be developed as screening and environmental protection for the
site.
B. Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to the terrain and to
existing buildings and structures in the vicinity that have a visual
relationship to the proposed development. Provision shall be made for
screening of all parking, service and loading areas, playgrounds,
equipment and storage areas from adjacent properties.
C. Adequate provision shall be made for vehicular and pedestrian
circulation, including walkways, interior drives and parking. Special
attention shall be given to location and number of access points to the
public streets, width of interior drives, general interior circulation,
separation of pedestrian and vehicular traffic and arrangement of
parking areas that are safe and convenient and do not detract from the
design of proposed structures and the neighboring properties.
D. Provision shall be made for the proper location and adequate intensity
and direction of outdoor lighting, so that lighting shall be reflected
away from adjoining premises and public rights-of-way. The size,
location, design, color, texture, lighting and materials of all signs shall
not detract from the design of the proposed buildings and structures
and the surrounding properties and streets or create confusion with
other signs or for drivers of vehicles or pedestrians, and shall conform
to the provisions of Article X.
E. There shall be a careful review by the Borough Engineer, at the
applicant's expense, of the anticipated average and maximum rates of
sewage flow from any proposed structure, and a determination shall be
made, to the satisfaction of the Planning Board, that existing sewerage
and sewage treatment capacity are sufficiently adequate to convey and
treat such anticipated sewage flow.
F. The Planning Board, after consultation with the Borough Engineer, shall
determine that there is adequate provision for drainage from the
proposed site, such drainage to be so arranged that no deleterious
effect can reasonably be expected in this regard upon adjacent
properties or upon the general health and welfare of the community.
G. The Planning Board shall be assured that the proposed development
will not interfere with the ecological balance of the community or the
surrounding properties.
§ 94-101 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 94-101
1:555
§ 94-102. Miscellaneous regulations.
H. Adequate provision shall be made for the collection, disposition and
recycling of recyclable materials consistent with the goals of the State
Recycling Plan.
A. Performance assurances. In approving a site plan, the Planning Board
may require that the applicant first furnish to the borough a surety
performance bond, guaranty or other form of security, acceptable in
form and content to the Borough Solicitor, for the purpose of assuring
the completion and maintenance of such off-site and on-site
improvements included in the site plan as will affect the public health,
safety or general welfare, such as but not limited to drainage, streets,
curbs, gutters, curb cuts, fire hydrants, recreational areas, shade trees,
shrubbery, other landscaping, trash disposal, off-street parking, loading
and unloading zones, artificial lighting and sidewalks. Such surety
performance bond, guaranty or other form of security shall be required
for no more than two (2) years after issuance of the certificate of
occupancy.
B. Failure to act deemed approval. The failure of the Planning Board to act
within the time periods prescribed by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. shall
constitute final approval; provided, however, that the time periods
prescribed herein may be extended by mutual agreement between the
Planning Board and the applicant.
C. Effect of County Planning Board approval.
(1) In the event that Camden County Planning Board approval of the
site plan is required, a building permit shall not be issued following
Merchantville Planning Board approval until the Merchantville
Planning Board is notified by the Camden County Planning Board.
(2) In the event that County Planning Board review and approval
results in any changes in the site plan, a building permit shall not
be issued until such changes are reviewed and approved by the
Merchantville Planning Board in accordance with § 94-100B.

to in violation of this chapter or any building, structure or land used or
maintained in violation of this chapter, any person, firm or corporation so
offending shall be subject to a fine of not more than five hundred dollars

manner provided by law.
§ 94-108. Fees.
A. The fees set forth in this section are identified either as application fees
or escrow fees. The application fee is payable to the Borough of
Merchantville and is a flat fee to cover direct administrative expenses
and is nonrefundable. The escrow fee shall be placed in an escrow fund
with the Borough Treasurer. Said fund shall be used to pay the fees of
any professional personnel employed to process, review, inspect and
make recommendations on said application, together with any costs or
expense, such as preparation of a transcript of the concerned hearing
or hearings or a duplication of the respective tape recordings.
Application fees and escrow fees are to be made commensurate with or
prior to the filing of the application. In the event that the escrow
deposited by the applicant exceeds the actual costs incurred, the
balance of moneys on deposit with the Borough Treasurer shall be
returned to the applicant. If at any time it becomes evident that the
escrow fund is or will be insufficient to cover the expenses as set forth
above, said funds shall be increased as required by the Planning Board
or Zoning Board of Adjustment or Historic Preservation Commission by
notification to the applicant. The applicant shall submit a cashier's
check in the amount of such additional charges, payable to the Borough
of Merchantville, to the Zoning Officer who shall then notify the
appropriate board of the availability of such funds. All costs incurred by
the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment or Historic
Preservation Commission in obtaining engineering, stenographic, legal,
planning or other professional services relating to and arising out of the
application review shall be payable by the applicant and shall be
deducted from the applicant's deposit. Any unexpended funds
remaining in this deposit shall be returned to the applicant following
disposition of the application. Escrow deposits shall be administered in
accordance with the requirements of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2. If the escrow
account is depleted or in arrears, no further action shall be taken on
such application until the applicant has satisfied its obligations to fund
the escrow account. In the event approval has been secured from either
the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment or Historic
Preservation Commission and it becomes apparent that the account will
be insufficient to cover all professional expenses, the account shall be
funded to cover such expenses, and in the event that the applicant is

1:559
