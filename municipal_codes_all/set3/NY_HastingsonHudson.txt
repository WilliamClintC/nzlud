taken while in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities.

of its officers and employees and further finds that such security is also
required for local personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Board of
Trustees does not intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right
or responsibility of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson or its employees
with regard to indemnification or legal defense. It is solely the intent of

judicial proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines,
based upon his or her investigation and review of the facts and
circumstances of the case, that representation by the Village
Attorney would be inappropriate or whenever a court of competent
jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or by special proceeding,
determines that a conflict of interest exists and that the employee
is entitled to be represented by private counsel of his or her choice.
The Village Attorney shall notify the employee, in writing, of such
determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel of his or her choice.

representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or the
amount of litigation expenses or the reasonableness of attorney's
fees shall be resolved by the court upon motion or by way of a
special proceeding.
C. Duty of Village Attorney. Where the employee delivers process and a
request for a defense to the Village Attorney as required by § 14-5 of
this chapter, the Attorney shall take the necessary steps, including the

settlement, and submit such settlement and certification to the Village
Attorney. The Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as to
form and amount and shall give his or her approval if, in his or her
judgment, the settlement is in the best interest of the village. Nothing in
this subsection shall be construed to authorize the village to indemnify
or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement not so
reviewed and approved by the Village Attorney.

against the employee or upon the settlement of the claim, the employee

ADULT BOOKSTORE  An establishment having as a substantial or
significant portion of its stock-in-trade books, magazines, periodicals,
A. The Board of Trustees hereby finds that adult entertainment uses of
property, by their very nature, have serious objectionable
characteristics that can have a significant impact on the neighborhood
and community in which they are located. The Board of Trustees further
finds that:
(1) The uncontrolled proliferation of such uses would be inconsistent
with the nature of the village as a primarily residential, familyoriented
community.
(2) Such uses can contribute to the blighting or downgrading of
neighborhoods in which they are located as a result of their related
potential for an increase in crime and the undermining of the
economic, moral and social welfare of the community.
(3) Such uses can adversely impact the general health, safety and
economic well-being of the entire community and, in particular, the
children of the community.
(4) The location of such uses in areas where children reside or may
regularly assemble is of great concern to the Village of Hastingson-
Hudson.
B. Therefore, it is the purpose of this chapter to prevent a concentration of
these uses in any one area and to specifically reduce their potential
accessibility to children.

A. The Board of Trustees hereby finds that appropriate design and good
quality materials for the exteriors of buildings, signs and other
structures favorably affects the desirability of the immediate area and
neighboring areas and, by so doing, enhances the benefits of occupancy
and value of real property in such areas; improves conditions affecting
the health, safety, comfort and general welfare of the community;
promotes appropriate land use; and creates a favorable relationship
between the taxable value of real property and the cost of municipal
services required.
B. It is therefore the purpose of this article to prevent the harmful effects
of inappropriate design and poor quality materials for the exteriors of
buildings, signs and other structures erected in the village, and thus to
conserve the value of real property; to encourage appropriate land use;
and to promote and protect the health, safety, comfort and general
welfare of the community.
A. There is hereby created an Architectural Review Board, which shall
serve in an advisory capacity to the Building Inspector and Planning
Board and, upon request, shall consult with the Board of Trustees, the
Zoning Board of Appeals and other Village boards and commissions. In
addition, the Architectural Review Board shall have the authority to
approve changes to any facade or roof in the Central Commercial (CC)
District that do not require building permits, as provided in § 295-76 of
this Code. [Amended 11-16-2010 by L.L. No. 7-2010]
B. The Architectural Review Board shall consist of five members, who shall
serve without compensation and shall be residents of the Village. All
members of the Board shall be specifically qualified by reason of
training in architecture, architectural engineering, interior design,
community planning, landscape architecture or other relevant business
or professional experience to judge the effects of a proposed building
upon the desirability, property values and development of surrounding
areas; and at least one and preferably three members of such Board
shall be registered architects of the State of New York.
C. The Village Board shall appoint an alternate member of the
Architectural Review Board to serve for a period of three years. The
alternate member shall substitute for a member of the Architectural
Review Board in the absence of a member or in the event that a member
is unable to participate because of a conflict of interest. All provisions of

or at such times as the Chairman of the Board may determine for the
purpose of reviewing any application for permit referred to it. Three
members of the Board shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of
business. The Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings showing the
vote of each member upon each question, or, if absent or failing to vote,
indicating such fact, and shall also keep records of its examinations and
other official actions.
A. The Building Inspector shall promptly refer to the Board any
application for a permit for the construction, reconstruction or
alteration of any building, sign or other structure, but not for interior
work that would not be visible from the street and not for detached
single-family residential structures except those which are developed
as part of a subdivision. The application shall be accompanied by such
drawings and material samples as may be required to clearly indicate
the design intent. [Amended 12-17-1996 by L.L. No. 4-1996;
11-16-2010 by L.L. No. 7-2010]
B. The Architectural Review Board shall advise the Building Inspector
within 30 days of its receipt of the application, drawings and material
samples. The Building Inspector may attend meetings of the
Architectural Review Board in order to be fully informed of its
deliberations and recommendations.

C. If an application for permit requires action by the Planning Board, the
Architectural Review Board shall consult with and advise the Planning
Board regarding said application prior to such action by the Planning
Board.
D. In advising the Building Inspector and Planning Board, the
Architectural Review Board shall consider the following:
(1) Adjacent use of excessively similar or excessively dissimilar
facades or structures arranged without respect to natural features
of terrain or other existing structures.
(2) Appropriateness of a structure or land development in relation to
any other structure or land development existing or for which a
permit has been issued, or to any other structure or land
development included in the same application in respect to one or
more of the following features:
(a) Cubic contents.
(b) Gross floor area.
(c) Height of building or height of roof.
(3) Appropriateness of other significant design features, such as
material or quality of architectural design, roof structures,
chimneys, exposed mechanical equipment and service and storage
enclosures, signs, landscaping, retaining walls, fences, lighting
posts and standards.
E. A finding of inappropriateness shall state not only that such
inappropriateness exists, but also that such finding is not based on
personal preference as to taste or architectural style, and further that
the inappropriateness is of such a nature as to be expected to provoke
beyond reasonable doubt one or more of the following harmful effects:
(1) Impairment of conditions affecting the health, safety, comfort or
general welfare of inhabitants of the immediate area or
neighboring areas.
(2) Impairment of the benefits of occupancy or value of improved or
unimproved real property in the immediate area or neighboring
areas.
(3) Conflict with most appropriate use of land in the immediate area or
neighboring areas.

real property and the cost of municipal services required to be
provided therefor.
F. Except by mutual agreement of the applicant and the Architectural
Review Board, the Board must render a decision on an application

decision on an application within such time frame, or within such
extended period agreed to by mutual consent, approval shall be deemed
to have been given. [Amended 11-16-2010 by L.L. No. 7-2010]

BUILDINGS, NUMBERING OF
GENERAL REFERENCES
Building construction  See Ch. 101.
§ 104-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter shall be to require the clear display of house
numbers from public streets for all properties that contain principal
buildings within the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson in order to assist the
general public or the authorities in identifying any property in case of an
emergency, as well as for the welfare of the general public in conducting its
normal affairs.
§ 104-2. Scope; display of numbers required.
This chapter shall apply to all properties within the Village of Hastingson-
Hudson that contain a principal building thereon, whether or not said
building is occupied. Such premises shall bear and display at least one
set of house numbers, which shall be assigned by the Building Inspector.
Buildings facing two or more public roadways shall be required to display
auxiliary numbers, if necessary, to pass the visibility test (as hereinafter
set forth) when viewed from those points in the center line of the public
roadway opposite those points where regularly used pedestrian or vehicular
passageways enter the public roadway.
§ 104-3. Display specifications.
In order to comply with this chapter, house numbers shall be Arabic in
design, shall have a minimum height of three inches and shall be mounted
in a secure fashion to the building's front wall or to a porch or other fixed
appurtenance in front of the building in the general vicinity of the main
entryway or main path of travel which leads to the main entrance from a
public street, or otherwise separately mounted in an approved manner upon
the face of a wall or upon a post in the front yard of the premises. Auxiliary
numbers shall be mounted at a height between four feet and 10 feet above
the adjacent grade or exterior landing directly beneath but never higher
than 15 feet above the adjoining grade. They shall be sufficiently legible
as to contrasting background, arrangement, spacing, size and uniformity of
integers so that the numbers may be read with ease during the daylight
hours by a person possessing at least 20/40 vision as he views the numbers
from the center line of the facing street and at an elevation of five feet above
the finished surface thereof. The numbers shall be so placed that trees,
shrubs or other obstructions do not block the line of the numbers from the
center of the street to any appreciable degree.
§ 101-13 BUILDINGS, NUMBERING OF § 104-4
104:83
§ 104-4. Existing numbers.
Existing numbers used or premises which essentially comply with numbers
officially assigned by the Building Inspector, at least to the extent that such
number or numbers are in logical sequence with the number or numbers
assigned to properties on either side which are located on the same side of
the street, shall be considered as bearing the correct number or numbers
for the purposes of this chapter. Existing installations which essentially
meet the requirements and/or spirit of these regulations, including numbers
presently on or attached to a mailbox, may be granted approval by the
Building Inspector without further alteration.
§ 104-5. Failure to comply; assessment of costs.
The absence of house numbers or the insecure fastening or absence of
any integer thereof, or the use of any number out of logical sequence for
the street toward which it faces, or the failure of a number to meet the
elevation requirement or the visibility requirements shall be considered as
a violation of this chapter. Failure on the part of the property owner to
comply with the provisions of this chapter within a period of 15 days from
the date of issuance of a notice of violation shall be sufficient cause for the
Village Building Inspector to proceed with carrying out the provisions of
this chapter and assess any costs incurred to the property owner concerned,
with a minimum charge of $20 for each property in violation.
§ 104-6. Building Inspector to be final authority.
The final authority for determining and assigning the number or numbers to
be used upon any particular property shall be the Building Inspector of the
Village of Hastings-on-Hudson.

building or part thereof, staging or structure, or his representative,
when it shall be satisfied that such change shall secure equally well the
safety of such building or part thereof, staging or structure.
B. Interference prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person, whether

receipt of said accounting, render a bill for said expenses, together with
interest thereon at the rate of 6%, to the owner of said property.
C. In case the owner of the property shall fail, within a reasonable time, to
pay to the village the amount of said bill, the Board of Trustees shall
cause to be entered upon the next succeeding tax roll prepared for the
village an assessment against such property equal to the amount of said
bill, which assessment shall become due at the same time and shall be
collected in the same manner as the real estate taxes for the village,

A. It is the policy of both the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson and the State
of New York to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose
of economic development, to promote deeper penetration of energy
efficiency and renewable energy resources, such as wind and solar, and
wider deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine
the retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for
residential and small commercial customers in those markets. Among
the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is
community choice aggregation (CCA), which allows local governments
to determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on
behalf of its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments, including the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, to procure
energy supply service for their residential and small commercial
customers, who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement,
while maintaining transmission and distribution service from the

existing distribution utility. This chapter establishes a program that
will allow the Village to put out for bid the total amount of natural
gas and/or electricity being purchased by local residential and small
commercial customers. Bundled customers will have the opportunity to
have more control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean
energy innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and
value, and to protect the environment, thereby, fulfilling the purposes
of this chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.

§ 110-4. Procedures for eligibility; customer data sharing.
A. A Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program is hereby
established by the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, whereby the Village
shall work together with Sustainable Westchester to implement the
CCA Program to the full extent permitted by the Order, as set forth
more fully herein. The Village's role under the CCA Program involves
the aggregating of the electric and/or natural gas supply of its residents
and the entering into a contract with one or more suppliers for supply
and services. Under the CCA Program, the operation and ownership of
the utility service shall remain with the distribution utility.
B. The Village's participation in a CCA Program constitutes neither the
purchase of a public utility system, nor the furnishing of utility service.
The Village will not take over any part of the electric or gas

Part 1
[Adopted 7-6C-C1H98-11 DBiystLr.iLc.t No. 6-1981]
ARTICLE I
Purpose
§ 112-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees has inspected Parcels 76, 76A and 76B of § 10
("parcels") of the Village Tax Map and has reviewed topographic surveys
showing proposed developments of said parcels under a clustered
subdivision plan and a conventional subdivision plan. The Board of Trustees
has determined that the property contains an especially desirable
abundance of cultivated stands of tall pine trees, hemlocks and other
healthy and venerable trees and open land areas, some of which are
attractive and visible to the general public along Broadway and from the
Aqueduct. The Board of Trustees further finds that the views, terrain and
elevations are such that a clustered housing development is likely to be
less visible from surrounding areas than a conventional one-family home
development.
§ 112-2. Intent.
The Board of Trustees finds that the creation of a clustered housing district
confined to the parcels will result in a substantially diminished impact upon
the community or change in the general appearance of the village and
neighboring properties and is less likely to be seen by persons passing
by or on Broadway and will substantially promote the conservation and
enhancement of natural beauty and resources on land not topographically
suitable for the construction of a conventional one-family home subdivision.
§ 112-1 CONSERVATION OR CLUSTERED HOUSING § 112-2
112:93

ARTICLE II
Creation; General Provisions
§ 112-3. Establishment.
A conservation or clustered housing district, "CCH," is hereby created by
amending the Village Zoning Map to create such a district to be known
as "CCH-1" on the Zoning Map, which district shall be confined to Parcels
76, 76A and 76B of § 10 of the Village Tax Map, ("parcels"). Such parcels
may be developed pursuant to a site plan subject to this Part 1 and to the
requirements of the district of which they were previously designated on
the Village Tax Map.
§ 112-4. Permitted dwelling units.
On such site, notwithstanding front, rear and side yard restrictions
otherwise contained in Chapter 295, Zoning, and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Part 1 and in § 7-738 of the Village Law of the State of New
York, dwelling units may be in attached, semidetached, detached, grouped
or clustered form.
§ 112-5. Grouping of houses.
The design of such a site plan shall provide for the grouping or clustering
of houses so that each cluster is set off from the others and from adjacent
property by intervening open space with the intention of permanently
preserving the undeveloped land and of permanently preserving as much
of the existing foliage as possible, particularly around the perimeter of the
site.
§ 112-6. Preservation of open space.
CCH District subdivisions shall result in the preservation of open space
areas having meaningful scenic, ecological, environmental and/or
recreational characteristics, with such access, shape, size and location as
determined to be appropriate by the Planning Board and acceptable to
the Board of Trustees to satisfy the intended purpose. The permanent
preservation of such open space areas shall be legally assured in
accordance with the provisions of this Part 1 by the filing of appropriate
covenants, deed restrictions, easements or other agreements in recordable
form acceptable to the Village Attorney to accomplish the restriction of any
and all subsequent residential or other development and/or the modification
of the minimum density or other requirements of this Part 1.

site plan that each such deed or lease will be recorded at the Westchester
County Clerk's office within 10 days after its execution and the form of
such consent or provision must be approved by the Village Attorney prior to
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.
§ 112-35. Division of ownership; property owners' association.
A. The ownership of conserved land areas shall be divided among all
owners of building lots within the conservation subdivision, except
where all or an appropriate portion of the conserved land areas are
deeded to a recognized conservation organization dedicated to the
preservation of open space and such dedication is acceptable to the
conservation organization and to the Planning Board and the Board of
Trustees in order to provide that all residents in a clustered residential
development shall have access at all times onto land in the development
on which no structures are erected, except for any private lots in single
ownership with individual dwelling units, and except that the roads or
other open lands in the development may, with the approval of the
Planning Board and the Board of Trustees, be dedicated to the village.
Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy, the subdivider shall
execute and file with the Planning Board such documents as, in the
opinion of the Village Attorney, will be sufficient to create a property
owners' association responsible for the continued ownership, use and
maintenance of all conserved land areas in accordance with the
following requirements:
(1) Membership in the association must be mandatory for each
property owner within the subdivision and for any successive
property owners.

use of such areas shall be limited to appropriate conservation, open space
and recreation purposes as determined by the Planning Board subject
to the limitations in § 112-22. A portion of the conserved land area(s)
may be designated "active recreation area" on the subdivision plat, in
a location approved by the Planning Board. Such active recreation area
shall not exceed 5% of the total area of the proposed subdivision. Within
such area, structures and facilities for active recreation purposes, including
playground equipment, swimming pools, tennis courts and so forth, may be
constructed and operated for the use of the property owners in the CCH
subdivision and their guests. Where determined appropriate, the Planning
Board may specify a phased construction schedule for such structures and
facilities. Enlargement of such structures and facilities not shown on the
filed plat shall be subject to approval of the Planning Board.
§ 112-37. Access.
It is the specific intention to maximize the open space available for use
and access to the residents of the cluster development. All residents in
a clustered residential development shall have access at all times onto
and use of land in the development on which no structures are erected.
Privately owned lots which were not included in determining the maximum
density of a clustered development may be excluded from the provisions of
this section. Roads or other open lands in the development may, upon the
(3) The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local
taxes and the maintenance of the conserved land areas, including
any active recreation areas and related facilities.
(4) Each lot owner within the subdivision shall be made responsible for
paying his proportionate share of the association's costs, and the
assessment levied by the association shall become a lien on the
property if not paid.
(5) The association shall have the power to adjust assessments to meet
changing needs.
B. In the event that the maintenance, preservation and/or use of the
conserved land area(s) ceases to be in compliance with any of the above
requirements or any other requirements specified by the Planning
Board when approving the subdivision plat, the village shall be granted
the right to take all necessary action to assure such compliance and to
assess against the association and/or each individual property owner
within the subdivision all costs incurred by the village for such
purposes.
C. The establishment of such an association shall be required prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

Part 2
[Adopted 7-2C3C-1H9-826 DBisytLri.cLt. No. 6-1986]
ARTICLE VI
Purpose
§ 112-55. Findings.
The Board of Trustees has inspected Parcels 13, 25 and 28 of Sheet 1
and Lot 3, Block 601, of Sheet 1 ("parcels") of the Village Tax Map and
has reviewed topographic surveys showing proposed developments of said
parcels under a clustered subdivision plan and a conventional subdivision
plan. The Board of Trustees has determined that the parcels form a unique
shape with a long, narrow, private access, that the parcels contain and
abut open land areas, including the Old Croton Aqueduct and county open
space property (Lenore Preserve), and that the parcels abut a residential
institution (Graham-Windham School) and an apartment house. The Board
of Trustees further finds that the views, terrain and elevations are such that
a clustered housing development is likely to be less visible from surrounding
areas than a conventional one-family home development.
§ 112-56. Intent.
The Board of Trustees finds that the creation of a clustered housing district
confined to the parcels will result in a substantially diminished impact upon
the community or change in the general appearance of the village and
neighboring properties and is less likely to be seen by persons passing
by or on Broadway, and will substantially promote the conservation and
enhancement of natural beauty and resources on land not topographically
suitable for the construction of a conventional one-family home subdivision.

Creation; General Provisions
§ 112-57. Establishment. [Amended 10-4-1988 by L.L. No. 3-1988;
3-7-1989 by L.L. No. 2-1989]
A conservation or clustered housing district, "CCH-2," is hereby created by
amending the Village Zoning Map to create such a district to be known as
"CCH-2" on the Zoning Map, which district shall be confined to Parcels 13,
25 and 28 of Sheet 1 and Lot 3, Block 601, of Sheet 1 of the Village Tax Map
("parcels"). Such parcels may be developed pursuant to a site plan dated
November 23, 1987, subject to this Part 2 and to the requirements of the
district of which they were previously designated on the Village Tax Map.
§ 112-58. Permitted dwelling units.
On such site, notwithstanding front, rear and side yard restrictions
otherwise contained in Chapter 295, Zoning, and subject to the conditions
set forth in this Part 2 and in § 7-738 of the Village Law of the State of New
York, dwelling units may be in attached, semidetached, detached, grouped
or clustered form.
§ 112-59. Grouping of houses.
The design of such a site plan shall provide for the grouping or clustering
of houses so that each cluster is set off from the others and from adjacent
property by intervening open space with the intention of permanently
preserving the undeveloped land and of permanently preserving as much
of the existing foliage as possible, particularly around the perimeter of the
site.
§ 112-60. Preservation of open space.
CCH-2 District subdivisions shall result in the preservation of open space
areas having meaningful scenic, ecological, environmental and/or
recreational characteristics and in the creation of recreational facilities,
with access, shape, size and location as determined to be appropriate by
the Planning Board and acceptable to the Board of Trustees to satisfy the
intended purpose. The permanent preservation of such open space areas
shall be legally assured in accordance with the provisions of this Part
2 by the filing of appropriate covenants, deed restrictions, easements or
other agreements in recordable form acceptable to the Village Attorney to
accomplish the restriction of any and all subsequent residential or other
development and/or the modifications of the minimum density or other
requirements of this Part 2.
§ 112-57 CONSERVATION OR CLUSTERED HOUSING § 112-60
112:115

which the site is located. Each structure shall comply with the lot area and
building standards of the district or districts in which it is originally located
and with all other requirements of this Part 2, except with respect to front,
rear and side yard restrictions, and houses may be clustered or attached
or semidetached. The side, front and rear yard setbacks of attached or
semiattached dwelling units shall also comply with the standards of the
district or districts in which the site is located, except as expressly modified
by the Board of Trustees when approving the site plan, but if the dwellings
are detached, such setbacks may be reduced by not more than 50%.

party walls that will satisfactorily limit sound transmission between
adjoining dwelling units.
A. Determination of density. The number of building lots permitted in a
CCH-2 subdivision shall in no case exceed the number which could be
permitted, in the Planning Board's judgment, if the land were
subdivided into lots conforming to all normally applicable requirements
of Chapter 295, Zoning, the Westchester County Health Department
Regulations and all other applicable requirements. The basis for this
determination by the Planning Board shall be a conventional
preliminary subdivision plot for the subject property, plus such other
information as may be required by said Board.
B. Type and arrangement of buildings. The type of residential dwelling
units permitted within a CCH-2 subdivision shall be, at the discretion of
the Planning Board and subject to the conditions set forth herein, in
detached, semidetached and/or attached buildings. The minimum
distance between any two clustered structures shall be equal to at least

Ownership of Open Space
§ 112-83. Conserved land areas to be defined in site plan;
development restricted.
As a condition of final approval, the open space or undeveloped land area

documents as, in the opinion of the Village Attorney, will be sufficient to
create a property owners' association responsible for the continued
ownership, use and maintenance of all conserved land areas, in
accordance with the following requirements:
(1) Membership in the association must be mandatory for each
property owner within the subdivision and for any successive
property owners.

use of such areas shall be limited to appropriate conservation, open space
and recreation purposes, as determined by the Planning Board subject to
the limitations in § 112-75. A portion of the conserved land area(s) may be
designated "active recreation area" on the subdivision plat, in a location
approved by the Planning Board. Such active recreation area shall not
exceed 10% of the total area of the proposed subdivision. Within such
area, structures and facilities for active recreation purposes, including
playground equipment, swimming pools, tennis courts and so forth, may be
constructed and operated for the use of the property owners in the CCH-2
subdivision and their guests. Where determined appropriate, the Planning
Board may specify a phased construction schedule for such structures and
facilities. Enlargement of such structures and facilities not shown on the
filed plat shall be subject to approval of the Planning Board.
§ 112-87. Access.
It is the specific intention to maximize the open space available for use
and access by the residents of the cluster development. All residents in
a clustered residential development shall have access at all times onto
and use of land in the development on which no structures are erected.
Privately owned lots which were not included in determining the maximum
density of a clustered development may be excluded from the provisions
of this section. Roads or other open lands in the development may, upon
(3) The association must be responsible for liability insurance, local
taxes and the maintenance of the conserved land areas, including
any active recreation areas and related facilities.
(4) Each lot owner within the subdivision shall be made responsible for
paying his proportionate share of the association's costs, and the
assessment levied by the association shall become a lien on the
property if not paid.
(5) The association shall have the power to adjust assessments to meet
changing needs.
B. In the event that the maintenance, preservation and/or use of the
conserved land area(s) ceases to be in compliance with any of the above
requirements or any other requirements specified by the Planning
Board when approving the subdivision plat, the village shall be granted
the right to take all necessary action to assure such compliance and to
assess against the association and/or each individual property owner
within the subdivision all costs incurred by the village for such
purposes.
C. The establishment of such an association shall be required prior to the
issuance of a certificate of occupancy.

Building construction  See Ch. 101.
Stormwater management  See Ch. 250.
Zoning  See Ch. 295.
§ 146-1. Findings.
The Village of Hastings-on-Hudson finds that the potential and/or actual
damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents
of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson and that such damages may include
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 146-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 146-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
A. Regulate uses that are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to
water or erosion hazards or that result in damaging increases in erosion
or in flood heights or velocities.
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities that serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction.
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers that are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters.
D. Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development that may
increase erosion or flood damages.
E. Regulate the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or that may increase flood hazards to other lands.
F. Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance
Program.
§ 143-23 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 146-3
141:182
§ 146-4. Definitions; word usage.
A. Protect human life and health.
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood-control projects.
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard.
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas.
G. Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a waiver.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone
on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent
or greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of
one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable, and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE,
AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred
to as the "base floodplain" or "l00-year floodplain." For purposes of this
chapter, the term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in
meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.

of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete, or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces that would be experienced during periods of
flooding.

unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other
structures, mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling
operations or storage of equipment or materials.
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building built, in the case
of a building in Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to
have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones
V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow
of the water; and adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural
integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the
base flood. In the case of Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C,
X, or D, elevated building also includes a building elevated by means
of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones

Westchester County, New York, All Jurisdictions" dated September
28, 2007.
B. The above documents are hereby adopted and declared to be a part of
this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and/or maps are on file at:
Village of Hastings-on-Hudson Building Department, 7 Maple Avenue,
Hastings-on-Hudson, New York 10706.
A. This chapter includes all revisions to the National Flood Insurance
Program through March 20, 1997, and shall supersede all previous laws
adopted for the purpose of flood damage prevention.
B. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter
shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the promotion
of the public health, safety, and welfare. Whenever the requirements of
this chapter are at variance with the requirements of any other lawfully
§ 146-4 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 146-7
141:188
§ 146-8. Warning and disclaimer of responsibility.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by human-made or natural
causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special
flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of
the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
under it.
§ 146-9. Designation of local administrator.
The Village Building Inspector is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 146-10. Floodplain development permit.
adopted rules, regulations, ordinances, or local laws, the most
restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards, shall govern.
A. Requirement of permit. A floodplain development permit is hereby
required for all construction and other development to be undertaken in
areas of special flood hazard in the Village for the purpose of protecting
its citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 146-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing: the nature, location,
dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed
structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location
of the foregoing.
B. Application for permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information where applicable.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
§ 146-7 FIREARMS, FIREWORKS AND EXPLOSIVES § 146-10
141:189
§ 146-11. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 146-12C(3).
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 146-12E.
(5) A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered
or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 146-6, when notified by
the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the local administrator, which shows whether proposed
development to be located in an area of special flood hazard may
result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments that are greater than either 50 lots or five acres.
C. Fees. All applications for floodplain development permits shall be
accompanied by an application fee to be determined by the Village
Board of Trustees by resolution and set in the fee schedule. In addition,
the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village, in
accordance with the provisions of Chapter 223, Professional Fees, of
the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson Code for any additional costs
necessary for the review, inspection, and approval of the project.
A. Permit application reviews. The local administrator shall:
§ 146-10 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 146-11
141:190
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 146-10, and for compliance with the provisions
and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development to
determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe
from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in an area of
special flood hazard, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall meet the applicable standards of § 146-12.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., streambank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§ 146-12, no permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
New York State or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the Village's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation data
(these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor identified
a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review, and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, New York State, or other source, including
data developed pursuant to § 146-10B(7), as criteria for requiring
that new construction, substantial improvements, or other
proposed development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. With respect to the alteration of any
watercourse, the local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
§ 146-11 FIREARMS, FIREWORKS AND EXPLOSIVES § 146-11
141:191
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, the local administrator shall obtain from the permit
holder a certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The certificate
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed
land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. A
certificate of elevation must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any waiver provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 146-14 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 146-14 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.
(1) The local administrator shall issue a certificate of compliance upon
satisfactory completion of all development in areas of special flood
hazard in conformance with the requirements of this chapter.
Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted, as prescribed in § 146-11E, and/or any certified
elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing, anchoring requirements,

A. Procedure.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson
is hereby authorized to hear and decide appeals and requests for
waivers from the requirements of this chapter.
(2) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it
is alleged that there is an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
(3) In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage;
§ 146-12 FIREARMS, FIREWORKS AND EXPLOSIVES § 146-13
141:197
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community;
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development;
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program of that area;
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(j) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated
with conducting search and rescue operations during periods
of flooding;
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
(l) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
(4) Waivers shall be issued only upon receiving written justification of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the waiver would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a waiver will not result in
increased flood heights, pose additional threats to public
safety, engender extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(5) Waivers shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
§ 146-13 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 146-13
141:198
(6) Waivers shall be issued only upon a determination that the waiver
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
(7) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection A(3) above and the
purposes of this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach
such conditions to the granting of waivers as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(8) Any applicant to whom a waiver is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that: the issuance
of a waiver to construct a structure below the base flood level will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to
amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and such
construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and
property. Such notification shall be maintained with the record of
all waiver actions as required in § 146-11H of this chapter.
(9) The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any waivers to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.
(10) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals
may appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article
78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
B. Conditions for waivers.
(1) Generally, waivers may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in § 146-13A(3)(a) through (l) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the waiver increases.
(2) Waivers may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(b) The waiver is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
(3) Waivers may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for
the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(a) The criteria of § 146-13A(4), (6), (7) and § 146-13B(1) are met.

No structure in an area of special flood hazard shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered and no land shall be
excavated or filled without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and any other applicable regulations. Any infraction of the provisions of
this chapter by failure to comply with any of its requirements, including
infractions of conditions and safeguards established in connection with
conditions of the permit, shall constitute a violation. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall,
upon conviction thereof, be fined no more than $250 or imprisoned for not
more than 15 days, or both. Each day of noncompliance shall be considered
a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Village
from taking such other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy
an infraction. Any structure found not compliant with the requirements of
this chapter for which the developer and/or owner has not applied for and
received an approved waiver under § 146-13 will be declared noncompliant
and notification sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

§ 156-8 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 190-1
166:218
§ 190-1. Purpose.
§ 190-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADMINISTRATOR  The head of the Department.
BENCHMARKING INFORMATION  Information generated by Portfolio
Manager, as herein defined, including descriptive information about the
physical building and its operational characteristics.
BUILDING ENERGY BENCHMARKING  The process of measuring a
building's energy use, tracking that use over time, and comparing
performance to similar buildings.
COVERED MUNICIPAL BUILDING  A building or facility that is owned or
occupied by the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson that is 1,000 square feet or
larger in size.
DEPARTMENT  The Building Department of the Village of Hastings-on-
Hudson.
ENERGY  Electricity, natural gas, steam, hot or chilled water, fuel oil,

The poorest performing buildings typically use several times the energy
of the highest performing buildings for the exact same building use. As
such, this chapter will use building energy benchmarking to promote
the public health, safety, and welfare by making available good,
actionable information on municipal building energy use to help
identify opportunities to cut costs and reduce pollution in the Village of
Hastings-on-Hudson.
B. Collecting, reporting, and sharing building energy benchmarking data
on a regular basis allows municipal officials and the public to
understand the energy performance of municipal buildings relative to
similar buildings nationwide. Equipped with this information, the
Village of Hastings-on-Hudson is able to make smarter, more costeffective
operational and capital investment decisions, reward
efficiency, and drive widespread, continuous improvement.
§ 190-1 HOUSING STANDARDS § 190-2

Environmental Protection Agency to track and assess the relative energy
performance of buildings nationwide, or successor.
UTILITY  An entity that distributes and sells energy to covered municipal
buildings.
WEATHER NORMALIZED SITE EUI  The amount of energy that would
have been used by a property under thirty-year average temperatures,
accounting for the difference between average temperatures and yearly
fluctuations.

(2) For each covered municipal building individually:
(a) The status of compliance with the requirements of this
chapter; and
(b) The building address, primary use type, and gross floor area;
and
(c) Annual summary statistics, including site EUI, weather
normalized source EUI, annual GHG emissions, and an energy
performance score where available; and
(d) A comparison of the annual summary statistics (as required
above) across calendar years for all years since annual
reporting under this chapter has been required for said
building.
A. The Administrator or his or her designee from the Department shall be
the Chief Enforcement Officer of this chapter.
B. The Chief Enforcement Officer designated hereunder may promulgate
regulations necessary for the administration of the requirements of this
chapter.
C. Within 30 days after each anniversary date of the effective date of this

by the Planning Board, due to the nature of such use and the type and
number of vehicle trips which it will generate, particularly in relation to the
capacity of the street system serving the lot upon which it is to be located,
that the result will be unusual traffic hazards or congestion or noise and
well-being of persons or damage to property. No use shall be permitted
which will cause any dissemination whatsoever of toxic or noxious
matter outside the building in which the use is conducted.
C. Nothing herein shall prohibit the normal and usual use of any stove,
fireplace or other outdoor cooking devices, provided that the emission
therefrom shall not endanger the public health, safety, comfort or other
aspects of the general welfare or cause to be a potential source of
damage or injury to property.
A. Radiation. The handling, storage or disposal of radioactive material or
waste by-products, whether or not licensed by the Atomic Energy
Commission, shall be conducted only in accordance with the standards
established in Title 10, Chapter 1, Part 30, Code of Federal Regulations,
Standards for Protection Against Radiation, as amended, and in
accordance with any other applicable laws or regulations.

air pollution conditions that are inconsistent with provisions of this chapter.
If, however, a limit is placed upon such use, either in terms of employees
or other appropriate measure, which, in the opinion of the Planning Board,
would be adequate to ensure that the potential traffic generation from such
use will be properly related to the capacity of the street system serving it,
the approving authority may approve such use with such limitation to which
the owners are required to adhere.
§ 217-15. Evidence of conformance.
In the case of any application for the establishment of a use which, in
the opinion of the Planning Board, may violate any preceding performance
standards contained in this chapter, the Planning Board may require the
applicant, at his own expense, to provide such evidence as is necessary to
determine whether or not the proposed use will conform. If the Planning
Board determines it necessary, expert advice may be obtained, with the cost
of such advice paid for in advance by the applicant as a condition of further
consideration of the application. Any permitted use, once established, shall
be maintained in strict accordance with the standards and requirements
contained herein as a condition of its continuance.
§ 217-16. Enforcement; notice of violation; noncompliance.
[Amended 2-1-2005 by L.L. No. 2-2005; 3-4-2008 by L.L. No. 1-2008]

performance standards contained in this chapter, other than of §§ 217-6 or
217-7, the following procedures shall be followed:
A. The Building Inspector shall give written notice, by certified mail,
return receipt requested, or any other method of delivery providing
proof of delivery, to the owner and tenants of the property upon which

believes there is a violation in fact and shall require an answer or
correction of the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the Building
Inspector within a reasonable time limit set by said Building Inspector,
but in no event to exceed 30 days. The notice shall state that failure to
reply or to correct the alleged violation to the satisfaction of the
Building Inspector shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The notice
shall further state that, upon request of those to whom it is directed,
technical determinations of the nature and extent of the violation as
alleged will be made and that, if violation as alleged is found, costs of
the determinations will be charged against those responsible, in
addition to such other penalties as provided by law.
B. If, within the time limit set, there is no reply but the alleged violation is
corrected to the satisfaction of the Building Inspector, he shall note

full notice to every person concerned that the amount of the statement,
plus interest, constitutes a charge against the property designated and
described in the statement and that the same is due and collectible as
provided by law.

STEEP SLOPES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Building construction  See Ch. 101.
Environmental quality review  See Ch. 131.
Zoning  See Ch. 295.
§ 249-1. Purpose and intent.
A. A fundamental responsibility of the Planning Board is protection of the
people and the land within the borders of the Village. The topography of
Hastings-on-Hudson is hilly and characterized by steep slopes and
rocky outcroppings. Construction on such terrain has the inherent risk
of causing damage to the ecology.
B. In the past, the inability to build on such sites created a natural form of
protection. Recent developments in the technology of construction have
now exposed more sensitive sites to development and, consequently,
potential risk to the environment. In addition, the scarcity of buildable
land has made these sites more desirable.
C. Steep slopes are environmentally sensitive areas and a valued natural
resource. The Planning Board recognizes the need to protect these
areas from any adverse effects of disturbance in order to ensure the
public health, safety and general welfare. At the same time, the
Planning Board recognizes the need to achieve a balance between
protecting the public interest and safeguarding the rights of property
owners regarding the use of their land.
D. Steep slopes, including vegetation and rock outcroppings located on
them, are important environmental features that contribute
significantly to the visual impression one forms when traveling through
Hastings-on-Hudson. Areas that are highly visible from roadways, other
public places and adjacent and nearby properties are particularly
important in maintaining Hastings-on-Hudson's character.
Overdevelopment of or improperly managed disturbance to these areas
are detrimental to the visual character of Hastings-on-Hudson.
E. It is in the public interest to regulate, preserve, protect and conserve
steep slopes so as to maintain and protect the natural terrain and its
vegetative features, preserve wetlands, water bodies and watercourses,
prevent flooding, protect important scenic views and vistas, preserve
areas of wildlife habitat, provide safe building sites and protect the
subject property and adjoining properties by preventing erosion, creep
and sudden slope failure.
§ 244-22 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 249-1
224:299
§ 249-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SLOPE  The ratio of vertical to horizontal distance, measured in a
minimum area of 1,000 square feet.[Amended 12-20-2011 by L.L. No.
1-2012]
STEEP SLOPE(S)  Ground area(s) of at least 1,000 square feet with a
slope of 15% or more, as measured in accordance with § 249-3.
§ 249-3. Determination of steep slopes.
Slope is to be determined from on-site topographic surveys prepared with a
two-foot contour interval. The vertical rise is to be measured, on the basis
of two-foot contours, in a ten-foot horizontal length.
§ 249-4. Applicability. [Amended 12-20-2011 by L.L. No. 1-2012]
Any construction, development, paving, regrading, or stripping of
vegetation that might affect or create a steep slope requires steep slope
approval granted in accordance with this chapter.
§ 249-5. Restrictions on steep slope disturbances.
F. The intent of this chapter is twofold: to preserve steep slopes to the
greatest extent practicable and to regulate their use by minimizing the
deleterious effects of development on slopes both to adjacent and
nearby properties.
G. The MR-C and the CC Districts are excluded from the application of
§ 249-5 because of the existing development and the desired density in
these downtown districts and other provisions in the Zoning Code to
control the height of buildings in these districts.61
A. For any lot that contains a slope in excess of 15% but not greater than
25%, not more than a total of 35% of such steep slope shall be:
(1) Developed;
(2) Paved;
(3) Regraded; or
(4) Stripped of vegetation without appropriate measures to prevent
erosion.
B. For any lot that contains a slope in excess of 25%, not more than a total
of 25% of such steep slope shall be:
(1) Developed;

ARTICLE I
Stormwater Management and Erosion Control
§ 250-1. Legislative findings.
The Board of Trustees hereby determines:
§ 250-2. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing within the Village of Hastings-on-
Hudson and to address the legislative findings in § 250-1 above. This article
seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species.
C. Clearing, grading, excavating, soil disturbance, or placement of fill
during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of
native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the Village.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion, and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 250-1 PROPERTY MAINTENANCE § 250-2
224:305
§ 250-3. Applicability.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as
amended or revised.
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
General Permit for Construction Activities, GP-02-01, or as amended or
revised.
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels.
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities that would otherwise degrade local water
quality.
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff that flows from
any specific site during and following development to the maximum
extent practicable.
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices and ensure that these management practices
are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
G. Encourage the use of green infrastructure practices to control
stormwater runoff, such as protecting natural areas, reducing
impervious cover, and using runoff reduction techniques, to the
maximum extent practicable. [Added 1-18-2011 by L.L. No. 2-2011]

including but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible
violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higherthan-
typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants;
inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higherthan-
usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type that are more likely than the typical discharge to cause
violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the
SPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may
include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair
records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and

beneficiary. The security shall be in an amount to be determined by
the Village based on submission of final design plans, with reference to
actual construction and landscaping costs. The performance guarantee
shall remain in force until the surety is released from liability by the
Village, provided that such period shall not be less than one year
from the date of final acceptance or such other certification that the
facility(ies) have been constructed in accordance with the approved
plans and specifications and that a one-year inspection has been
conducted and the facilities have been found to be acceptable to the
Village. Per annum interest on cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested
in the account until the surety is released from liability.
B. Maintenance guarantee. Where stormwater management and erosion
and sediment control facilities are to be operated and maintained by the
developer or by a corporation that owns or manages a commercial or
industrial facility, the developer, prior to construction, may be required
to provide the Village with an irrevocable letter of credit from an
approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper operation and
maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion control
facilities, both during and after construction, and until the facilities are
removed from operation. If the developer or landowner fails to properly
operate and maintain stormwater management and erosion and
sediment control facilities, the Village may draw upon the account to
cover the costs of proper operation and maintenance, including
engineering and inspection costs.
A. Notice of violation. When the Village determines that a land
development activity is not being carried out in accordance with the
requirements of this article, it may issue a written notice of violation to
the landowner, applicant, contractor, subcontractor, and/or developer.
The notice of violation shall contain:

violations of this article. Persons receiving a stop-work order shall be
required to halt all land development activities and other construction
activities, except those activities approved by the Village that address
the violations leading to the stop-work order. The stop-work order shall
be in effect until the Village confirms that the land development activity
is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed.
Failure to address a stop-work order in a timely manner may result in
civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the
enforcement measures authorized in this article.

jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this
article shall be deemed misdemeanors, and for such purpose only all
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such
violations. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a separate
additional violation.
E. Withholding certificate of occupancy. If any building or land
development activity is installed or conducted in violation of this article,
the Stormwater Management Officer may prevent the occupancy of
said building or land.
F. Restoration of lands. In addition to any penalty provided herein, any
person in violation of this article may be required to restore land to its
undisturbed condition and/or mitigate on-site and off-site damage from
stormwater runoff, sediment, or pollutants resulting from the violator's
activities. In the event that restoration or mitigation is not undertaken
within a reasonable time after notice, the Village may take necessary
corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the

authorization of the SMO, the owner of the property will be notified of
the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property
owner may file a written protest with the Village Board of Trustees
objecting to the amount of the assessment within 10 days of receipt of
the notice. If the amount due is not paid within 30 days after the
disposition of any protests or the expiration of the time to file an appeal,
whichever is earlier, the charges shall become a lien on the property for
the amount of the assessment, to be collected in the same manner as
real estate taxes.
E. Penalties. In addition to any penalty provided herein or by other law,
any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a
violation punishable by a fine not less than $500 nor more than $1,000

to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt
or dust nuisance, the Superintendent may require the permittee to
provide toe boards or bins; and if the excavated area is muddy and
causes inconveniences to pedestrians, temporary wooden plank walks
shall be installed by the permittee as directed by the Superintendent. If

using part of the adjacent sidewalk, the permittee shall keep a
passageway, at least 1/2 the sidewalk width, open along such sidewalk
line.
L. Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of
7:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday, unless the

in case of an emergency.
M. In granting any permit, the Building Inspector or Superintendent may
attach such other conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to
prevent damage to public or private property or to prevent the
operation from being conducted in a manner hazardous to life or

may include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed;
(2) Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment;

Inspector, the Superintendent or a designated village inspector is
present.
D. The work of the permanent restoration, including both paving surface
and paving base, shall be performed by the permittee according to
village specifications.
E. If the Building Inspector finds that paving surfaces adjacent to the
street opening may be damaged where trenches are made parallel to
the street, or where a number of cross trenches are laid in close
proximity to one another, or where the equipment used may cause such
damage, the Village Manager may require a negotiated payment from
the permittee for the resurfacing in place of patching of such street if,
in his opinion, the damage will be so excessive it will require the
complete resurfacing of the street area involved. Such negotiations
shall be carried on and payment agreed upon prior to issuance of a
permit.
F. After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted and completed with due diligence.
G. The Building Inspector shall make daily inspections of all work
authorized by a permit.
H. Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of the
permit, the permittee shall notify the Building Inspector in writing. A
certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the Building Inspector
to each permittee no sooner than one year after the permanent
restoration of the excavation has been made, provided the work
authorized by the permit has been performed according to village
specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Building
Inspector shall make a final inspection of the restoration to determine
whether village specifications have been adhered to.

I. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one year
from the date of completion of the permanent restoration, any expense
incurred by the village in correcting such settlement shall be paid by
the permittee or recovered from his bond, unless the permittee submits
proof satisfactory to the Building Inspector that the settlement was not
due to defective backfilling.
J. In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in the
charge or care of the village or any of its officers or employees, and no
officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume any
jurisdiction over any such opening, except in the exercise of police
power, when it is necessary to protect life and property.
K. If any restoration completed by a permittee is not satisfactory to the
Superintendent, and the permittee shall fail to correct the work to the
satisfaction of the Superintendent, the Superintendent may cause such
work to be done to his satisfaction. All expenses incurred by the Village
shall be recovered from the deposit or bond provided by the permittee
under this article. [Added 6-16-2015 by L.L. No. 3-2015]
L. If any excavation for which a permit has been issued hereunder exceeds
25 feet in length, the permittee shall be responsible for resurfacing the
street from curb to curb over the entire area in a manner and with

A. Computation of deposits. The Building Inspector, upon receipt of a
properly completed application, shall determine the amount of the
deposit to be made by the permittee; provided, however, that the
deposit shall not be less than an amount to be determined by the Village
Board by resolution and set in the fee schedule.67 The deposit shall be
paid at the time the permit is received, and the deposit shall be used to
reimburse the village for the cost of any work and materials furnished
by it in connection with the work authorized by the permit and for any
other purpose set forth in this article. [Amended 6-20-1966;

B. Form of deposit. The deposit may be either in the form of a certified,
treasurer's or cashier's check or in lawful money of the United States.
C. Insufficient deposit. If any deposit is less than sufficient to pay all costs,
the permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the village an amount equal to
the deficiency. If the permittee refuses or fails to pay such deficiency,
the village may institute an action to recover the same in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full, no
additional permits shall be issued to such permittee.

F. Decision on costs. The Building Inspector shall estimate the cost of any
work performed by the Street Department pursuant to the provisions of
this article. If, in the opinion of the permittee, the Building Inspector's
cost estimates are excessive, he may appeal the Building Inspector's
decision to the Village Manager. If, in turn, he is not satisfied with the
Village Manager's decision, he will have the right to final appeal of the
cost estimates to the Village Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees'
decision will be final in all cases.
G. Refund of deposit. Upon notification by the permittee that all work
authorized by the permit has been completed, and after restoration of
the opening and final inspection, the Building Inspector shall refund to
the permittee his deposit less all costs incurred by the village in
connection with said permit and any other expenses required by this
article, for which final settlement has not been made. In no event shall
the permit fee be refunded once work has been undertaken.
A. Maintenance bond requirements. Each applicant upon the receipt of a
permit shall provide the village with an acceptable corporate surety
bond to guarantee faithful performance of the work authorized by a
permit granted pursuant to this article. The amount of the bond shall be
100% of the estimated cost of restoring the street opening as
determined by the Building Inspector. The term of the bond shall begin
upon the date of posting thereof and shall terminate upon the receipt by
the permittee of a certificate of final inspection from the Building
Inspector. If the permittee anticipates requesting more than one permit
per year as required by this article, he may furnish one continuing
corporate surety bond to guarantee faithful performance in such
amount as the Building Inspector deems necessary. The amount of such
bond shall be in relation to the cost of restoring pavement cuts to be
made by the permittee throughout the year.
B. Default in performance. Whenever the Building Inspector shall find that
a default has occurred in the performance of any term or condition of
the permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to
the surety on the bond. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the

TATTOOING
§ 257-1. Findings.
It has been the experience of other municipalities, including the City of New
York, that tattooing has led to increased cases of serum hepatitis. It has also
been their experience that regulatory measures have proved ineffective in
eliminating this health risk because of the inability to supervise tattooing
establishments at all times. The Village of Hastings-on-Hudson also lacks
the resources and personnel to supervise tattooing establishments on an
ongoing basis. Accordingly, the Board of Trustees finds that in this village,
as in other communities, a ban on tattooing except for medical purposes is
the only feasible means of protecting the public against disease from this
source.
§ 257-2. Prohibited activities; exceptions.
It shall be unlawful for any person to tattoo a human being within the
Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, except that tattooing may be performed
for medical purposes by a person licensed or otherwise pursuant to the
Education Law to practice medicine or osteopathy.
§ 257-3. Penalties for offenses.
An offense against the provision of this chapter shall be punishable by a fine
of not more than $250 or by imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or
both.

telegraphy, or in or by reason of the furnishing for such consumption or use
of gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph service in
the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson, including cash, credits and property of
any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom on account of the cost

associations, copartnerships, estates, assignee of rents, any person acting

thereto, or of whether use is made of the public streets.

Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of
its business and in such form as the Board of Trustees of the Village of

§ 260-2 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 260-4
257:360
§ 260-4. Returns to be filed.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before the
25th day of June in each year, a return for the 12 calendar months preceding
such return date or any portion thereof for which the tax imposed hereby
is effective; provided, however, that in lieu of the annual return required
by the foregoing provisions, any utility may, at its option, file quarterly, on
or before September 25, December 26, March 25 and June 25, a return
for the three calendar months preceding each such return date, and in
the case of the first such return, for all preceding calendar months in the
year during which the tax imposed hereby was imposable and effective.
Every return shall state the gross income or gross operating income for the
period covered thereby. Returns shall be filed with the Village Treasurer on
a form to be furnished by him for such purpose and shall contain such other
data, information or matter as shall be required to be included therein.
The Village Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may
require at any time a further or supplemental return, which shall contain
any data that may be specified by him, and he may require any utility
doing business in the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson to file an annual return,
which shall contain any data specified by him, regardless of whether the
utility is subject to tax under this article. Every return shall have annexed
thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility making the same, or of the
owner or of a copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation,
if such business be conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the
statements contained therein are true. Every return, other than that of
a corporation, shall set forth the name of the owner or owners, or, if a
copartnership, the names of all partners.
§ 260-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 260-6. Insufficient or unsatisfactory returns; determination of tax;
hearing; assessment of additional tax.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from him, or if no return is made for any period, the Board of Trustees
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as it is
able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. The Village Treasurer shall give notice of
such determination to the person liable for such tax. Such
determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the
person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving
of notice of such determination, apply to the Board of Trustees, for a

257:361
§ 260-7. Service of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return by him under this article, or, if no return has been filed,
then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 260-8. Penalty for failure to file return or pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof, within the time required by this article, shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first mouth, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village
Treasurer, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return, but
for a period not exceeding 90 days from the date it was due, and if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may, subject to the approval of the Board
hearing, or unless the Board of Trustees, of its own motion, shall reduce
the same. After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of
the decision of the Board of Trustees to the person liable for the tax.
Such decision may be reviewed by a proceeding under Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Act of the State of New York70 if application therefor
is made within 90 days after the giving of notice of such decision. An
order to review such decision shall not be granted unless the amount
of any tax sought to be reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon,
if any, shall be first deposited with the Village Treasurer and an
undertaking filed with him, in such amount and with such sureties as a
Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such
proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay
all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of such
proceeding or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may
be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties, costs and
charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be required
to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to the
granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as
required by this article the tax may be assessed at any time.

of Trustees, remit all or any portion of the penalty fixed by the foregoing
provisions of this section.
§ 260-9. Application for refund.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Board of Trustees or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer, subject to the
approval of the Board of Trustees, shall refund the amount so determined.
For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so made
on the initiative of the Board of Trustees. However, no refund shall be
made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Board
of Trustees as hereinbefore provided unless said Board, after a hearing
as hereinbefore provided, or of its own motion, shall have reduced the
tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding under
Article 78 of the Civil Practice Act of the State of New York71 that such
determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of
moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund, made as
hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of
any tax or penalty complained of and the Board of Trustees may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making its determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said
Article 78, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the
granting of such an order.
§ 260-10. Tax to be paid by utility.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 260-11. Action for enforcement.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by
this article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the direction of the Board of
Trustees, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. An action may
be maintained, as upon contract, by the Village to recover the amount of an
unpaid tax hereunder, together with 5% thereof for the first month after the
day upon which it is due and payable and an additional 1% for each month
and fraction thereof thereafter until paid. The proceeds of any judgment
obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer. Each such
tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to
pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax and
penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.

§ 260-12. Administration; rules and regulations.
In the administration of this article the Board of Trustees shall have the
power to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent

performance of the duties of the Village Treasurer, and to prescribe the
form of blanks, reports and other records relating to the administration
and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony and proofs, under oath, with
reference to any matter under this article and to subpoena and require
the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers and

A. Except in accordance with proper judicial order or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Village Treasurer or any
agent, clerk or employee of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson to
divulge or make known in any manner the amount of gross income or
gross operating income or any particulars set forth or disclosed in any
return under this article. The officer charged with the custody of such
returns shall not be required to produce any of them or evidence of
anything contained in them in any action or proceeding in any court,
except on behalf of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson in an action or
proceeding under the provisions of this article, or on behalf of the State
Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under the provisions of the
Tax Law of the State of New York, or on behalf of any party to any action
or proceeding under the provisions of this article when the returns or
facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action or proceeding,
in either of which events the court may require the production of, and
may admit in evidence, so much of said returns or of the facts shown
thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding, and no more.
Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person,
or his duly authorized representative, of a copy of any return filed by
him, nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to
prevent the identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or
the publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who
have failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for
by this article, together with any relevant information which, in the
opinion of the Village Treasurer and Village Attorney, may assist in the
collection of such delinquent taxes; or the inspection by the Village
Attorney or other legal representatives of the Village of Hastings-on-
Hudson of the return of any person who shall bring action to set aside
or review the tax based thereon, or against whom an action has been
instituted in accordance with the provisions of this article.
B. Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be
punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or both, and if the offender be an officer, agent,

C. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article, the Village Treasurer
with the approval of the Board of Trustees may exchange with the chief
fiscal officer of any city or any other Village in the State of New York
information contained in returns filed under this article, provided that
such city or other Village grants similar privileges to the Village of
Hastings-on-Hudson, and provided that such information is to be used
for tax purposes only, and the Village Treasurer shall, upon request,
furnish the State Tax Commission with any information contained in
such returns.

The boundaries of such districts and special building lines are hereby
established as shown on the map entitled "Zoning Map, Village of Hastingson-
Hudson," dated June 22, 2004, and from time to time amended, which
§ 295-6 TATTOOING § 295-7
257:487
map, with all explanatory matter therein, accompanies and is hereby made
part of this chapter.110
§ 295-8. interpretation of district boundaries.
Where uncertainty exists as to the locations of any boundaries shown on the
Zoning Map, the following rules shall apply:
A. District boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines or the center line
of streets, railroads, rights-of-way or watercourses, or be parallel or
perpendicular thereto, unless such district boundary lines are indicated
by dimensions shown on the Zoning Map.
B. Where district boundary lines divide a lot or unsubdivided property, the
location of any such boundary, if not indicated by dimensions, shall be
determined by the use of the map scale appearing thereon.
C. Where district boundary lines are indicated as approximately following
the property lines of parks, other large public holdings or the
boundaries of the Village, such property lines shall be construed to be
the district boundary lines.
D. Where district boundaries are so indicated that they approximately
follow the edge of lakes, ponds, reservoirs or other bodies of water, the
mean high water lines thereof shall be construed to be the district
boundaries, except that the regulations of the most restrictive district
on the edge of such a body of water shall apply to the area within the
mean high water line and the body of water thereof. Unless otherwise
designated on the Zoning Map, the regulations of the most restrictive
district on the edge of the body of water shall apply to all land under the
water.
E. Any boundary extending into the Hudson River or other bodies of water
bordering the Village shall be deemed to extend to the boundary of the
Village, unless otherwise indicated.
F. If the district classification of any land is in question, it shall be deemed
to be in the most restrictive adjoining district.
G. All distances and measurements, with the exception of height, shall be
taken horizontally. Height measurements shall be taken vertically, or
perpendicular to horizontal measurements.
H. Unless otherwise noted, all areas designated as streets on the Zoning
Map defined in § 295-7 are hereby zoned R-20.
110. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Village offices.
§ 295-7 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-9
257:488
§ 295-9. Lots in two or more districts.
Where a lot in one ownership of record is divided by one or more district
boundary lines, the regulations for the less restrictive portion of such lots
shall not extend into the more restricted portion of the lot.
§ 295-10. Order of restrictiveness.
For purposes of these regulations, where districts are referred to as being
generally "more restrictive" or less restrictive" with respect to permitted
uses and intensity of development, the designation shall refer to the order
in which the districts are set forth in § 295-6, the first named being the most
restrictive.
§ 295-11. Schedule controlling land and buildings.
A. Purpose and adoption of schedule. To facilitate public understanding of
this chapter and for the better administration thereof, the regulations
governing the use of land and buildings and the location, arrangement
height and minimum size of buildings, and other requirements, are set
forth in the annexed schedule controlling land and buildings111 for each
of the districts established by § 295-6 of this chapter. That schedule
(hereafter referred to as "the schedule") is hereby adopted and
declared to be part of this chapter and may be amended in the same
manner as any other part of this chapter. References in parentheses in
the schedule do not constitute a part of this chapter. In the event of any
conflict between the text of this chapter and the schedule, the text shall
govern.
B. Application of schedule.
(1) All limitations for any district as to use, percentage of area,
permissible height, required yards and minimum sizes thereof,
minimum sizes of dwellings and all other requirements shall be
those set forth in the schedule, which, in the case of each district
named, shall be read across the schedule from left to right.
Wherever in the schedule there appear the words "Same as in
(symbol of district) above," those words shall be construed to
include the specific limitations set forth in the same column for the
district thus referred to. The listing of any use in the schedule
either as being permitted in, or as being excluded from, any
particular district shall be deemed to be an exclusion of that use
from every other district, unless the use is expressly permitted in
that other district under the language set forth in the schedule
applying to that district.
(2) No use of land or existing or proposed buildings or structures shall
be permitted in the Village unless expressly listed on the schedule
111. Editor's Note: See Appendix B, District Regulations Summary, included at the end of this
chapter.
§ 295-9 TATTOOING § 295-11

or interpreted as listed on the schedule by the Zoning Board of
Appeals in cases of unclarity. All permitted uses shall conform
with the standards as listed in the schedule and with additional
standards and provisions which may exist elsewhere in this
chapter, including but not limited to the provisions of site plan
review and special use permits.

the regulations specified in this chapter for the district in which it is located
or is to be moved.
§ 295-14. Completion of structures issued building permit before
chapter.
Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the
plans, construction or designated use of any building for which a building
permit was duly issued and on which actual construction was lawfully begun
and diligently carried on prior to the adoption of this chapter, provided
that the building shall be completed within 12 months after the passage
of this chapter. "Actual construction" is hereby defined to be the actual
placing of construction materials in their permanent position, fastened in
a permanent manner, except that where a basement or cellar is being
excavated, such excavating shall be deemed to be actual construction,
or where demolition or removal of an existing structure has been begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such demolition or removal shall be deemed
to be actual construction. Similarly, whenever a district shall be changed
hereafter, the provisions of this chapter with regard to building permits
issued prior to the passage of this chapter shall apply to building permits
issued for construction in that changed district before the time the
amendment effecting the change becomes effective.
§ 295-15. Conflicting standards.
In case of conflict between this chapter and any other Village statute, bylaw,
local law or regulation, the more restrictive standard shall apply. Examples
of such standards would include but not be limited to greater width or size

applicable to the main building. All other accessory buildings shall comply
with the requirements for accessory buildings as set forth in this chapter.
§ 295-18. Building lots and open spaces.
A. Lot measurements. All measurements herein shall be deemed to run to
and from the pertinent property lines, excepting only in the case of a

side and/or rear yards, the property line shall be deemed to be
equivalent to the street line.
B. Lot for every building. Every building hereafter erected and every use
hereafter established shall be located on a lot as defined herein. Unless
otherwise permitted in this chapter, there shall be only one use or use
category permitted per lot.
C. Subdivision of a lot. Where a lot is formed hereafter from part of a lot
already occupied by a building or structure, that separation shall be
effected in such a manner as not to impair conformity with any of the
requirements of this chapter with respect to the existing building and
all yards and other required spaces in connection therewith. No permit
shall be granted for the erection of a building or structure upon the new
lot thus created unless it complies with the provisions of this chapter.
D. Irregularly shaped lots. Where a question exists as to the proper
application of any of the requirements of this chapter to a particular lot
or parcel because of the peculiar or irregular shape of the lot or parcel,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine how the requirements of
this chapter shall be applied.
E. Required open space.

for the establishment of any use or the construction of any building or
structure, or any part thereof, unless the lot upon which that use is to
be established or that building or structure is to be built has frontage of
at least 70% of the lot width required for that district on a street or
highway that has been suitably improved to Village, county or state
road standards or a bond posted therefor, and unless the actual access
to the use, building or structure will be over that frontage or over a
right-of-way or easement satisfactory in location and physical condition
to the Village for such purposes, as set forth in § 7-730 of the Village
Law, all in accordance with the provisions of § 7-736 of the Village Law.
B. If a building permit is sought for the establishment of any use or

required minimum depth specified in this chapter, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may permit a reduction in the required depth of
the front yard for a new building on that lot, or expansion of an
existing building on that lot, provided that the spirit and intent of
this chapter is met and that the depth of the front yard shall
conform as nearly as practicable to that existing on the neighboring
lots.
E. Visibility at intersections.
(1) On a corner lot, no fence, wall, hedge or other structure or planting
shall be erected, placed or maintained in such a way as to obstruct
traffic visibility across the triangular area formed by the two

above. If so approved, such structures shall be screened in a
manner determined by the Planning Board to be appropriate and
consistent with the exterior of the building, unless such screening
would defeat their purpose. In any event, such structures shall not
exceed the maximum height permitted in the district; shall not be

§ 295-22. Application.
§ 295-23. Parking facilities dedicated to Village.
Required off-street parking facilities that, after development, are later
dedicated to and accepted by the Village shall be deemed to continue
to serve the uses, buildings or structures for which they were originally
provided.
§ 295-24. Existing structures and uses.
A. All buildings, structures and land uses hereafter erected, enlarged,
moved, created, changed in use or intensity or otherwise substantially
altered shall be provided with the amount of off-street parking and
loading space required by the terms of this chapter to meet the needs of
persons occupying or using such buildings, structures or land.
B. The plans for any new building or structure or any expansion of an
existing building or structure, when submitted for a building permit,
shall show specifically the location, size and type of improvements of
the off-street parking or loading space required to comply with this
chapter, and the means of access to such space from the public streets
or highways. Except for individual one- or two-family residences, no
building permit shall be issued until such plan for parking and loading
space and access to it and required improvement is approved by the
Planning Board as part of site plan approval, and the Planning Board
has determined that traffic access, traffic circulation and the general
layout of the parking facility are properly planned with regard to safety,
traffic on the public street and adequacy of access for cars and
pedestrians using the parking facility. No certificate of occupancy shall
be issued for any building or land use until the required off-street
parking and loading facilities have been established.
A. Buildings, structures and land uses in existence or for which building
permits have been approved on the effective date of this chapter shall
not be subject to the parking or loading space requirements set forth in
this chapter. However, any parking and loading facilities now existing to
serve such buildings, structures or uses shall not be reduced, except
where they exceed such requirements, in which case they shall not be
reduced below those requirements. Required parking and loading
facilities for the existing portion of such uses shall, however, be
provided at the time of any enlargement of such existing building,
structures or uses in the future, unless said building, structures or uses
are located in the CC District, in which case the provisions set forth in
§ 295-24 shall apply.

257:497
§ 295-25. Planning Board approval.
Except for parking spaces accessory to a one- or two-family dwelling, all
off-street parking and loading areas shall be developed in accordance with
Planning Board site plan approval and Planning Board guidelines.
§ 295-26. Location.
B. It is the policy of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson to limit the number
of driveways and curb cuts accessing off-street parking areas within the
CC and MR-C Districts in order to minimize conflicts between
pedestrian and motor vehicle traffic. In order to effectuate this policy,
the following standards apply: [Amended 11-19-2013 by L.L. No.
7-2013]
(1) A change of use or expansion of an existing use within an existing
building, structure or portion thereof, occupying 2,500 square feet
gross floor area or less located within or proposed to be located in
the CC or MR-C District, shall be exempt from providing off-street
parking.
(2) The Planning Board may reduce or waive the requirements for offstreet
parking and loading set forth in § 295-36 of this chapter
where it determines that a change of use or expansion of a use
within an existing building, structure or portion thereof, occupying
more than 2,500 square feet of gross floor area located within or
proposed to be located in the CC or MR-C District, will not generate
a significant increase in parking demand.
A. Except as permitted by Subsections B and C of this section, required
parking and loading spaces shall be provided upon the same lot as the
use, building or structure to which they are accessory.
B. Off-street parking spaces required for buildings, structures or land uses
on two or more adjacent lots may be provided in a single common
facility on one or more of the lots, provided that a legal instrument,
satisfactory to the Village Attorney, assures the continued existence of
the parking facility to serve the buildings, structures or land uses as
long as they may exist. Such agreements shall also guarantee that,
upon the termination of such joint use, each subsequent use of the
premises will provide off-street parking facilities for its own use in
accordance with all requirements of this chapter.
C. Substitution of equivalent parking.
(1) Where, for practical difficulties, strict compliance with the
minimum off-street parking requirements specified in this chapter
cannot be attained on that lot, the Board of Appeals, after notice
and hearing and upon recommendation of the Planning Board, may
permit the substitution therefor of equivalent off-street parking
space on another lot, provided that:
§ 295-24 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-26
257:498
§ 295-27. Different uses on single lot.
(a) The entrance to the substituted parking area is not over 750
feet by normal pedestrian travel from the building or use to
which such off-street parking space is to be appurtenant;
(b) No point of the substituted parking area is greater than 750
feet from the building or use to which it is to be appurtenant;
(c) The parking area is permitted in the district in which it is
located; and
(d) A legal instrument, satisfactory to the Village Attorney,
guaranteeing such continued use is furnished to the Village.
(2) If such alternate off-street parking space is authorized, such space
may not thereafter be used for any other purpose, unless other
alternative space complying with this subsection is substituted
therefor and approved by the Planning Board and the Board of
Appeals.
A. Except as provided in Subsection B, where two or more different uses
occur on a single lot, the total amount of off-street parking and loading
facilities to be provided shall be the sum of the requirements of each
such individual use on the lot.
B. The Board of Appeals, upon recommendation of the Planning Board,
may approve the joint use of parking space by two or more
establishments, the total capacity of which space is less than the sum of
the spaces required for each, provided that:
(1) The establishments can clearly demonstrate that, by reason of
variations in the probable time of maximum use by occupants of
such establishments, the parking capacity to be provided will
substantially meet the parking demand generated;
(2) The establishments provide a legal instrument satisfactory to the
Village Attorney that assures the continued existence and use of
the joint parking facilities in connection with the uses and
establishments they serve;
(3) The site plan clearly demonstrates that sufficient space remains for
the provision of the total amount of off-street parking required, and
the site plan bears such designation;
(4) The establishments shall submit written guaranties, satisfactory to
the Village Attorney, that any spaces that may have been waived
can be constructed within six months after written notice to the
property owner by the Planning Board that such spaces have been
determined as necessary and must be constructed; and
(5) Approval of such joint use shall be automatically terminated upon a
change of use at any such establishment.

(6) Such uses shall be located on the same or adjacent lots, except as
provided for in § 295-26C.
C. All such undeveloped parking space shall be used and maintained as
additional landscaped grounds until required for parking.
A. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, where an offstreet
parking or loading area in any business or multifamily residence
district adjoins a one-family residence district or is adjacent to a street,
park or other public open space, there shall be a suitably maintained
landscaped strip of a width specified in Subsection C below. Each such
landscaped strip shall consist of an evergreen hedge, wall or fence not
less than two feet in height, located at the inner edge of the landscaped
strip, exclusive of entrances and exits; and in front, or outside, of any
such wall or fence there shall be a planting screen of shrubbery not less
than four feet in width, at least 1/2 of which shall consist of evergreens
not less than two feet in height.
B. The shrubbery shall be of sufficient density to conceal, in midsummer of
the year succeeding the planting thereof, 25% of the vertical area of the
wall or fence. Any portion of the landscaped strip not occupied by
shrubbery shall be planted with a good-quality grass seed or permanent
plant cover, such as ivy or pachysandra or similar growth, and shall be
kept free of trash, suitably watered, except when prohibited in times of
drought, and suitably trimmed and maintained. Wherever motor
vehicles are to be parked adjacent to the landscaped strip, there shall
be a suitable curb or bumper guard, approved as to design and
construction by the Building Inspector.
C. Minimum widths of landscaped strips shall be:
(1) Along a street frontage, except as to entrances and exits: 10 feet.
(2) Along any boundary abutting directly on a residence district,
except as specified below: 10 feet.
(3) Along any boundary of a multifamily residence use, the adjacent
portion of which is used for the parking of passenger vehicles or for
access and turning areas appurtenant thereto: five feet.
(4) The Planning Board may require that trees be planted within said
landscape strip, provided said trees shall not impede sight lines
therefrom. The species and spacing of said trees shall be
determined by the Planning Board.
A. Each parking space shall be at least nine feet wide and 18 feet long. If
this space is enclosed, the Planning Board may require the size of the
space to be increased for maneuverability.

spaces.
Notwithstanding the provisions of § 295-29:
§ 295-31. Grades, drainage and marking of parking spaces.
Required off-street parking facilities may be enclosed in a structure, or
may be open, except as required specifically herein or by the Planning
Board in site plan review. All required parking facilities shall be graded,
surfaced, drained and maintained throughout the duration of their use to
the extent necessary to avoid nuisances of dust, erosion or excessive water
flow across public ways or adjacent lands. The maximum slope within a
parking area shall not exceed 5%. In multifamily residential developments
and in nonresidential developments, the Planning Board shall require the
provision of suitable markings to indicate individual parking spaces,
maneuvering area, entrances and exits.
B. Backup and maneuvering aisles between rows of parking spaces shall
be 25 feet wide, except that in areas with angled parking spaces, the
Planning Board may approve a lesser width, provided that it is adequate
and appropriate. Where such aisles are also needed to carry traffic to
and from other portions of the parking area to the street, the Planning
Board may require the width of the aisles to be at least 35 feet.
C. Where parked vehicles will overhang landscaped islands, the Planning
Board may reduce the required length of the parking spaces by not
more than the amount of the overhang, which shall not exceed two feet.
A. Parking spaces required for single-family and two-family dwellings may
be reduced in width to eight feet and may be provided in an accessory
garage or carport or in a driveway not less than eight feet nor more
than 24 feet in width or in a combination thereof, but may not encroach
upon any required yard and in any event may not be less than five feet
from any side or rear lot line.
B. Parking spaces required for any business use or for multifamily
dwellings or for accessory uses permitted thereto shall be paved and
clearly marked. Except in the CC and MR-C Districts, no parking space
accessory to such uses shall encroach on any required yard and in any
event shall not be closer than 10 feet to any side or rear lot line.
C. Parking spaces for all other uses shall be nine feet in width, paved and
clearly marked and, except in the CC and MR-C Districts, may not
encroach on any required yard.

shrubs and other plant materials. At least one tree, not less than 15 feet in
height at the time of planting, shall be provided within the parking area for
each 10 parking spaces. Such trees and landscaped areas shall be arranged
and designed in such a way as to provide vertical definition to major traffic
circulation aisles and to entrances and exits, and shall be of such type and
location as will provide the maximum of shade without interfering with sight
lines or impeding the safe flow of traffic. The type, size, amount and location
of all such landscaping shall be subject to the approval of the Planning
Board.
§ 295-33. Traffic circulation in parking areas.
In order to encourage safe and convenient traffic circulation, the Planning
Board may require the interconnection of parking areas by way of access
drives within and between adjacent lots. The Board shall require written
assurance and/or deed restrictions, satisfactory to the Village Attorney,
binding the owners and their heirs and assignees to permit and maintain
such internal access, circulation and interuse of parking facilities by the
users of the facilities.
§ 295-34. Snow storage in parking areas.
In all off-street parking areas containing 20 or more parking spaces,
adequate provision shall be made for the storage of snow, with a minimal
loss of parking capacity. The location of such snow storage areas shall be
indicated on the site plan and shall be compatible with the storm drainage
system.
§ 295-35. Commercial vehicles in parking areas.
Commercial vehicles with less than a three-fourths-ton capacity may be
parked in a residential district, provided that the vehicle shall be parked
entirely within a closed garage. Commercial vehicles with a three-fourthston
capacity or greater shall not be parked in any residential district.
§ 295-36. Schedule of off-street parking requirements.

which they are located. In no case, however, shall such signs include
any red or green or flashing or intermittent lights; lights of changing
degrees of intensity; nor shall such signs be of a type that has the whole

257:513
§ 295-52. Outdoor pools and ponds.
B. A temporary permit for use of a trailer,(Note: The term "trailer" is
defined in the Zoning Code as follows: Any vehicle mounted on wheels,
movable either by its own power or by being drawn by another vehicle,
and includes vehicles that are equipped to be used for living or sleeping
quarters or so as to permit cooking. Such vehicles remain trailers even
if the wheels are removed and/or the vehicle is placed on a temporary
or permanent foundation.) or portable home storage unit as a
temporary field office or for storage in connection with and only during
the course of construction or repair of a principal or accessory use on
the same lot may be issued by the Building Inspector for a period not
exceeding six months, renewable at his or her discretion if work on the
construction is diligently progressing but not yet completed for not
more than two additional six-month periods. The fee for such temporary
permit shall be fixed by the Board of Trustees by resolution. Such
temporary permit shall automatically expire 14 days after construction
or repair is completed.
C. Any such temporary field office or portable home storage unit may be
placed only on a driveway, in the rear yard or in an enclosed garage or
similar structure. No temporary field office shall be used for overnight
living quarters.
A. Setbacks. Except in the rear yard, no outdoor pool or pond shall be
constructed or installed unless every part of such pool is located at least
100 feet from every side or street line and no less than five feet from the
main building on the premises. If the pool is constructed or installed in
a rear yard, every part of the pool shall be at least 20 feet from every

acceptable enclosure, not less than four feet nor more than six feet
in height, either enclosing the entire portion of the premises upon
which the pool shall be situated or entirely surrounding the area in
which the pool is located. The enclosure or fence shall be of the
kind and character as to resist any attempt by children or animals
to enter the pool area.
(2) The enclosure or fence shall have not more than two openings for
ingress or egress. The openings shall not face the deep end of the
pool and shall have a self-closing gate or door with an adequate
lock, which can be opened from outside the pool enclosure only by
means of a key or combination. The gate, door and lock shall at all
times be maintained in proper working order to ensure that the
gate or door shall be kept closed and locked at all times when the
§ 295-51 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-52
257:514
pool is not in use. The type and height of the enclosure or fence
and the lock and gate, or door, shall be approved by the Building
Inspector, who shall, in evaluating a request for approval, give
due consideration to the adequacy and durability of the proposed
enclosure or fence to ensure the safety and welfare of the general
public, and particularly of small children, and to the terrain and
character of the district, with a view to conserving the value of
buildings and land and encouraging the most appropriate use of
land in the Village.
C. Rescue devices. All outdoor pools and ponds with depth greater than
four feet in any part shall be equipped with at least one rescue device,
such as a pole of at least 10 feet in length, a shepherd's crook, a ring
buoy, a heavy line or other such rescue equipment as recommended by
the American National Red Cross, which can be used by the
nonswimmer to make an unassisted rescue from land of a drowning or
potentially drowning person. Such a rescue device shall be placed not
less than six feet nor more than 10 feet from the edge of the pool near
the location of the greatest depth.
D. No cross-connection. There shall be no cross-connection between the
public water supply system of the Village and any pipes or apparatus
feeding water to a pool from a private well, system or other source; and
there shall be no such cross-connection between the public water
supply and any purification or filtration system of any pool.
E. Inlet and outflow. If the water for any pool is supplied from the public
water supply system, the inlet shall be more than six inches above the
overflow level of the pool.
F. Drainage. Drainage of the pool or pond shall be performed in a manner
that does not cause soil erosion or damage to public or private property
or that introduces into the Village drainage sewer system an amount of
water in excess of the capacity of such system.
G. Water treatment. The water of any outdoor pool used or intended for
swimming shall be treated in the manner sufficient to maintain the
bacterial standards established by all applicable provisions of law
relating to a public swimming pool existing in the same location or area.
H. No loudspeakers or floodlights. No loudspeaker device of any kind shall
be operated in connection with any outdoor pool or pond, nor shall any
floodlighting or any other lights be used in connection therewith that
shall throw rays of light beyond the property lines of the parcel upon
which the pool or pond is located.
I. Abandonment. Should the owner abandon the pool, the owner shall fill
in the depression. The Building Inspector shall be notified of the
abandonment so that an inspection of the site may be made and the
records of the permit be marked accordingly.
J. Residence districts. In residence districts,
§ 295-52 TATTOOING § 295-52
257:515
§ 295-53. Vehicular traffic.
(1) Outdoor pools and ponds shall be permitted only for use by
residents of the premises and their guests, without charge for
admission and not for the purpose of profit.
(2) Enclosures, sometimes referred to as "swimming pool bubbles" or
"bubbles" or the like, shall not be permitted.
(3) No outdoor pool or pond shall occupy more than 6% of the total lot
area.
K. Structures. An outdoor pool or pond shall be considered to be a
structure for the purpose of compliance with all provisions of law,
Village ordinances and the building code of the Village of Hastings-on-
Hudson;113 and in the construction, design and operation of the pool or
pond, all such laws, ordinances and building codes shall be complied
with unless clearly inapplicable by their terms or inconsistent with this
chapter.
L. Building permits. An outdoor pool or pond shall be a structure for
purposes of this chapter and therefore, among other things, shall not be
installed, reconstructed, altered, renovated, enlarged or moved without
a building permit. No such permit shall be issued unless the plans for
the pool or pond comply with the then-current building code of the
Village of Hastings-on-Hudson;114 any plans for the pool or pond shall
show such compliance and shall show appropriate drainage provisions
to dispose of the water in the pool without interference with the public
water system, the existing sanitary facilities, public sewers or drainage
systems or with any public highway. Such plans shall have affixed
thereto the signature of the owner or his or her agent and shall contain
a statement to the effect that the person signing the plans has read and
is familiar with the provisions of this chapter and other applicable
provisions of law relating to the installation, construction and
maintenance of outdoor pools and ponds.
M. Application. Except for the provisions of Subsection J(2) and (3),
Subsections B through L shall also apply to all outdoor pools and ponds
in existence on the effective date of this chapter.
A. No business or industrial use shall be permitted where it is determined
by the Planning Board that, because of the nature of the use and the
type and number of vehicle trips that it will generate, particularly in
relation to the capacity of the street system serving the lot upon which
the use is to be located, the result will be unusual traffic hazards or
congestion or noise and air pollution conditions that are inconsistent
with provisions of this chapter.
113. Editor's Note: See Ch. 101, Building Construction.
114. Editor's Note: See Ch. 101, Building Construction.
§ 295-52 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-53
257:516
B. If, however, a limit is placed upon the use, either in terms of employees
or by some other appropriate measure, that, in the opinion of the
Planning Board, would be adequate to ensure that the potential traffic
generation from the use will be properly related to the capacity of the
street system serving it, then the approving authority may approve the
use with that limitation, to which the owners are required to adhere.

ARTICLE VIII
Nonconforming Buildings, Structures, Lots and Uses
§ 295-54. Continuance of nonconformity subject to conditions.
Unless otherwise provided in this chapter, any lot, building, structure or use
of land that is not conforming with the provisions of this chapter, but that is
lawfully existing under the provisions of the local law in effect immediately
prior to the date on which this chapter becomes effective, may be continued
subject to compliance with the conditions set forth in §§ 295-55 through
295-65 below. Any unexcused failure to comply with those conditions shall
immediately render the lawful nonconformity unlawful; and the lot, building
or structure and any use thereof shall thenceforth conform to this chapter.
This section shall also apply to any lot, building, structure or use lawfully
existing on the effective date of any amendment to this chapter that makes
such lot, building, structure or use nonconforming with this chapter.
§ 295-55. Prohibition against extension of nonconformity.
§ 295-56. Restrictions on conforming alterations of nonconforming
lots, buildings and structures.
A. No lot, building or structure that is lawfully nonconforming with
respect to any area requirement, including, without limitation, height,
minimum yard size or minimum lot area per family, shall be enlarged or
altered in such a manner as to increase the nonconformity or so as
substantially to enlarge or increase the habitable or other useful area of
the nonconformity, including, without limitation, the alteration of roof
or floor levels or the addition of habitable or other useful area above or
below a lawfully nonconforming building or structure.
B. No lawfully nonconforming use of any land, building or structure shall
be enlarged, increased or extended to occupy a greater area of the land,
building or structure than that occupied by the use at the time of the
adoption of this chapter, nor shall such a lawfully nonconforming use be
moved in whole or in part to any other portion of the land, building or
structure occupied by that use at the time of the adoption of this
chapter or to any other land, building or structure.
A. No lot, building or structure that, because of a previously granted
variance or otherwise, is not in compliance with this chapter shall be
enlarged, moved or altered, except as follows:
(1) If the enlargement, move or alteration would reduce the
nonconformity;
(2) If the enlargement, move or alteration does not require a building
permit;
§ 295-54 TATTOOING § 295-56
257:519
§ 295-57. Change of nonconforming use to substantially more
conforming use.
The only use to which a lawfully nonconforming use may be changed is
one that is permitted under this chapter, except that the Board of Appeals,
upon application made within six months after the cessation of the lawfully
nonconforming use and after notice and hearing, may grant a temporary
conditional permit for a new use that does not conform with this chapter,
provided that the Board shall find that:
§ 295-58. Prohibition against reversion to nonconforming use.
No lawfully nonconforming building, structure or use, if changed in whole
or in part to a building, structure or use that conforms to or is in greater
conformity with the provisions of this chapter, shall be changed back to a
former lawfully nonconforming building, structure or use.
§ 295-59. Effect of discontinuance.
(3) If the enlargement, move or alteration is made pursuant to an order
of the Building Inspector to strengthen or restore the building or
structure or any part thereof to a safe condition; or
(4) If the enlargement or alteration complies with Subsection B of this
section.
B. A one- or two-family dwelling that is conforming with respect to use but
not conforming with respect to one or more area requirements may be
enlarged or altered in such a manner as not to increase the
nonconformity.
A. The proposed new use shall be confined to the same structure, building
and land;
B. The proposed new use will be substantially more in keeping with the
comprehensive zoning plan of land use and development and the
character of the neighborhood than the former nonconforming use; and
C. The proposed new use will tend to facilitate the later conversion of the
structure to a more conforming use.
A. Any lawfully nonconforming use of any land, building or structure that
has ceased for a continuous period of six months or longer shall be
deemed to be abandoned and shall not be resumed. If any
nonconforming use partially ceases for a continuous period of six
months or longer, the portion of the nonconforming use that has thus
ceased shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not be resumed.
B. If any lawfully nonconforming lot, structure or building shall cease to be
nonconforming, in whole or in part, for a continuous period of six
months or longer, then the portion of the nonconformity that has ceased
shall be deemed to be abandoned and shall not be resumed.

B. A single-family dwelling not falling within the category specified in
Subsection A above and not conforming to this chapter with respect to
required yards, if accidentally damaged from whatever cause to the
extent of not more than 50% of its volume above the foundations, as
determined and certified by the Building Inspector, may be restored on
its original foundations. If such a dwelling is damaged to more than
50% of such volume, it may be rebuilt or restored to provide an
equivalent livable area but shall conform to the side yard requirements
herein set forth and shall not be nearer to the street than the average
distance of the dwellings on the lots adjacent thereto on each side or, if
there be none adjacent, the average distance of the two nearest
dwellings on the same side of the street; in no event shall the dwelling
have a front yard with a depth that is less than that specified by Article
IX of this chapter for a front yard in the district in which the lot is
located.
C. In the event of the accidental destruction or damage, from whatever
cause, of a single building, the first floor of which prior thereto was
used primarily for the sale of goods at retail or the performance of
customary personal services, or a combination thereof, whether such
use was a conforming use or a lawful nonconforming use, may be
restored upon the original site for the continuance of the use, subject to
the following provisions:
(1) If the damage to the building was less than 50% of the volume
above the foundations, as determined and certified by the Building
Inspector, the building may be restored upon those foundations to
its original dimensions.

above the foundations, as determined and certified by the Building
Inspector, the building may be rebuilt, subject to the approval of
the Board of Appeals, upon the same lot in such manner as to
provide floor area for merchandising or personal services
equivalent to that existing prior to the damage, and subject to the
addition of such number of off-street parking spaces as the Board of
Appeals may determine can at reasonable cost be developed upon
the lot by means of access directly from the street on which the

circumstances in the particular case.
D. Any other building or structure not falling within the provisions of
Subsections A through C of this section, if damaged to the extent of not
more than 50% of its volume above the foundations, as determined and
certified by the Building Inspector, whether such use was a conforming
use or a lawful nonconforming use, may be restored upon the original
site to its former use and dimensions, but, if damaged to the extent of
more than 50% of its volume, as determined and certified by the
Building Inspector, may be restored to its original use and to an
equivalent usable building area in accordance with the applicable
provisions of Subsection C of this section.

permitted use on a lot for which a valid conveyance was recorded before the
effective date of this chapter, notwithstanding that the area or dimensions
of the lot are less than that required for the district in which it lies, provided
that:
§ 295-65. Lots made nonconforming by future amendment.

C. At no time since the effective date of this chapter has the owner of the
lot owned any contiguous lot. If at any time since the effective date of
this chapter the owner of the lot has owned any contiguous lot, then
that other lot, or so much thereof as may be necessary, shall be
combined with the lot for which the permit is sought to make one or
more conforming lots, whereupon a building permit may be issued, but

D. Boarders and accessory apartments.
(1) Statement of purposes.
(a) It is the purpose of this subsection to legalize and control
boarder units and accessory apartments in single-family

that accessory dwelling units do not contribute to traffic
congestion and parking problems, and that they meet
minimum health, fire and safety standards.
(b) It is the further purpose of this subsection to create small
rental housing units without increasing density, by utilizing
existing housing stock and resources. This subsection is also
intended to provide economic support for resident families,
particularly the elderly and those of moderate income, and to
encourage diversity in the population of the Village of
Hastings-on-Hudson.
(c) To help achieve these purposes, and to promote the other
objectives of this chapter and the Planning Principles outlined
by the Planning Board, including the promotion of the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the Village of Hastingson-

257:530
least 24 months immediately preceding the date of the

[b] Each sleeping room utilized by a single boarder shall
have not less than 100 square, feet of floor area,
exclusive of closet space, in any such room, and each
sleeping room utilized by two boarders shall have not
less than 120 square feet of floor area, exclusive of
closet space, in any such room.
[c] The dwelling may not have an accessory apartment,
nor may any accessory apartment exist in any other
building on the property.
[d] The dwelling shall be in compliance with this chapter
and all applicable building, fire, electrical, health and
other safety codes.
[e] In addition to the parking requirements for the
principal dwelling and other permitted uses, one offstreet
vehicular parking space must be provided for
each boarder or roomer. Boarders and/or roomers
shall be permitted to keep on the subject premises
only regular passenger automobiles or motorcycles.

Nonrefrigerated food storage will not be included in
the limitation. Microwave ovens shall be utilized on a
table or bench not to exceed 36 inches in height.
[g] For each boarder the property owner must obtain a
boarder permit from the Building Inspector. The
boarder permit may be issued by the Building
Inspector only after the subject application is
reviewed and approved by him or her. Such review
shall include but not be limited to a physical
inspection of the property to ascertain the adequacy of
the structure to accommodate such use, and the
adequacy of the site to provide appropriate off-street
parking facilities.
[2] Every application for a boarder permit shall be
accompanied by a fee to be set by the Board of Trustees
pursuant to § 295-152 of this chapter.

permits so that not more than 100 boarder permits are in
existence during any calendar year.
[6] All owners of dwellings that house one or more roomer or
boarder on the effective date of this subsection shall apply
to the Building Inspector for a boarder permit within 90
days of the effective date of this subsection. If application
is made within 90 days, the owner of the dwelling shall not
be deemed in violation of this subsection until a final
determination on the application has been made. If
application is not made within 90 days, the owner of the
dwelling shall be deemed in violation of this subsection.
[7] A boarder permit shall expire automatically upon change
of ownership of the dwelling or when the owner ceases to
reside in the dwelling. In such event, the roomer(s) or
boarder(s) shall be permitted to reside in the dwelling for
60 days if the owner of the dwelling so consents, unless the
Building Inspector approves an additional extension of
time.
[8] In the event that a dwelling with a valid boarder permit is
sold or transferred, the new owner may, within 60 days
from the taking of title, apply for a boarder permit. All of
the conditions set forth above must be met, except the new
owner need not have occupied the premises for 24 months
preceding the application. If an application is submitted
within the sixty-day period, the new owner shall not be
deemed in violation of this subsection, notwithstanding the
fact that the previous boarder permit expired. Should the
new owner have (a) boarder(s) or roomer(s) but fail to

of title, the new owner shall be deemed in violation of this
chapter. In addition, the new owner shall be precluded
from applying for a boarder permit for a period of one year
from the date on which title was transferred.
[9] Any property owner who houses roomer(s) or boarder(s)
and who fails to obtain a boarder permit or who violates

it shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine of not
more than $500 upon conviction of a first offense, and, for
the second and each subsequent conviction, by a fine of
not more than $1,500. Each month's continued violation
shall constitute a separate additional violation. In addition
§ 295-67 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-67
257:532
to the foregoing, any owner who violates any provision
of this subsection shall be subject to revocation of the
boarder permit by the Building Inspector.

of the dwelling units on the premises as a principal
residence.
[b] An accessory apartment shall be located in the
principal building or in a conforming accessory
building.
[c] An accessory apartment shall not be permitted in a
residence that houses one or more boarders or

principal residence at which the accessory apartment
is to be located.
[e] An applicant for an accessory apartment permit shall
furnish a site plan indicating existing building and lot
conditions and a dimensional floor plan of the
principal building and the proposed accessory
apartment. The site plan shall also include a location
map showing the applicant's property and adjacent
property and streets, location of existing and proposed
off-street parking and ingress and egress to the site.
[f] An accessory apartment permit may be issued by the
Planning Board only after the subject application is
reviewed and reported upon by the Building Inspector.
Such review by the Building Inspector shall include
but not be limited to a physical inspection of the
residence in which the accessory apartment is to be
located.
[g] The Planning Board shall conduct a public hearing on
the application for an accessory apartment permit.
The hearing shall be held upon the same notice as that
required for a zoning variance.
§ 295-67 TATTOOING § 295-67
257:533
[h] The minimum floor area for an accessory apartment
shall be 300 square feet, but in no case shall it exceed
33% of the floor area of the principal dwelling, unless,
in the opinion of the Planning Board, a greater or
lesser amount of floor area is warranted by the
specific circumstances of a particular building.
[i] The accessory apartment shall not include more than
two bedrooms.
[j] In addition to the parking requirements for the
principal dwelling and other permitted uses, one
accessible and usable off-street vehicular parking
space must be provided for the accessory apartment,
plus one additional space for each bedroom in excess
of one in the accessory apartment.
[k] No exterior changes shall be made to the building in
which the accessory apartment is located that, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, would alter the singlefamily
character and appearance of the residence.
[l] The proposed accessory apartment shall not adversely
affect the single-family character of the neighborhood.
In applying this requirement, the Planning Board shall
consider the effect of the proposed accessory
apartment on traffic, noise, congestion, appearance
and any other factor that the Planning Board deems
consistent with the purposes of this subsection.
[m] The proposed accessory apartment shall be in
compliance with all applicable building, fire,
electrical, health and other safety codes.
[2] It is the intent of this section that neighborhoods zoned as
single-family maintain their single-family character. The
Planning Board may deny an accessory apartment permit
should it find that the number of such apartments,
including the one proposed, will adversely affect the
character of the zoned single-family neighborhood. In
granting an accessory apartment permit, the Planning
Board shall have the authority to impose such reasonable
conditions and restrictions as are consistent with the spirit
and intent of the Accessory Apartment Law.
[3] Every application for an accessory apartment permit shall
be accompanied by a fee to be set by the Board of Trustees
pursuant to § 295-152 of this chapter.
[4] The Planning Board shall establish all rules and
regulations necessary to administer the provisions of this
§ 295-67 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-67
257:534
subsection. A record of all accessory apartment permits
shall be kept in the Village office.
[5] An accessory apartment permit shall be issued for a period
of not more than three years and may be renewed by
application to the Building Inspector. Notice of the
renewal request shall be given by the applicant to all
property owners within 100 feet by regular mail, with
proof of mailing provided, advising that any objection to
the renewal shall be provided to the Building Department.
Prior to renewal of the accessory apartment permit, the
Building Inspector shall inspect the accessory apartment
and determine that all the requirements of this subsection
are met. Provided that no objections are received and the
Building Inspector has determined that the accessory
apartment is in compliance, the Building Inspector shall
renew the permit for an additional three years. If
objections are filed, the Building Inspector shall have the
option of forwarding the request to the Planning Board to
conduct a public hearing on the renewal application on the
same notice as that required for a zoning variance, except
that mail notice need not be by certified mail, and to make
a determination on the application.
[6] An accessory apartment permit shall expire automatically
upon change of ownership of the principal residence or
when the owner ceases to occupy the residence. In such
event, the tenant of the accessory apartment shall be
permitted to remain in the apartment for 60 days, if the
owner of the principal residence so consents, unless the
Planning Board approves an additional extension of time.
[7] In the event that a residence with a valid accessory
apartment permit is sold or transferred, the new owner
may, within 60 days from the taking of title, apply for an
accessory apartment permit. The new owner must meet all
the requirements set forth in Subsection D(2)(b)[1] of this
section in order to obtain an accessory apartment permit.
If an application is submitted within the sixty-day period,
the new owner shall not be deemed in violation of this
subsection as long as the application is pending,
notwithstanding the fact that the previous accessory
apartment permit expired. Should a new owner maintain
an accessory apartment but fail to apply for an accessory
apartment permit within 60 days from the taking of title,
the new owner shall be deemed in violation of this
subsection. In addition, the new owner shall be precluded
from applying for an accessory apartment permit for a
period of one year from the date on which title was
transferred.

257:535
[8] Any owner or builder, or agent of either of them, who fails
to obtain an accessory apartment permit, who allows
occupancy of an accessory apartment in violation of this
subsection or who constructs or causes to be constructed
an accessory apartment shall be guilty of an offense
punishable by a fine of not less than $1,000. Each month's
continued violation shall constitute a separate additional
violation. In addition to the foregoing, any owner who
violates any provision of this subsection or any condition
imposed by the Planning Board in granting the permit
shall be subject to the revocation of the accessory
apartment permit by the Planning Board.

shall expire in three years or as set forth in the Board of
Trustees' approval, unless the required development progress
has been made or such time limit has been extended by the
Board of Trustees.
(4) Subdivision/site plan application to Planning Board.
(a) The approval or conditional approval of a MUPDD concept plan
application by the Board of Trustees shall authorize the
applicant to proceed with the detailed design and planning of
individual sections of the planned development and to submit
applications to the Planning Board for subdivision and/or site
plan approval, as appropriate, and in accordance with the
procedures and requirements for such applications as set forth
in this chapter. All such applications must conform with the
requirements of the approved MUPDD concept plan, and any
findings and conditions issued in connection therewith by the

grant approval or conditional approval shall be determined
to be capable of being self-supporting, sustainable, and
environmentally sound in the event that the applicant does
not proceed with other sections.
[3] The dedication of land for permanent preservation and the
construction of on-site and/or off-site infrastructure
improvements shall be accomplished in conformance with
the approved phasing plan and shall be installed so as to
properly serve the proposed site development. In order to
make such determination, the Planning Board may require
the preparation and submission of such additional detailed
plans and/or studies with respect to water supply,
sewerage service, stormwater drainage, road
improvements, and other utilities and services, as the
Planning Board may find necessary to allow it to determine
their adequacy not only to serve the individual section(s)
proposed but also to be properly related to utilities and
services which, in the future, will serve the MUPDD as a
whole.

257:592
property the shoreline shall be deemed to be the westernmost
edge of the remaining decking.
(b) With respect to any upland, landfill or submerged portion of a
subject property lying inland (easterly) from vertical timber
piles which were in place in the Hudson River as of July 1,
1989, and which formerly were fender piles or which formerly
supported decking that is no longer in place, the term
"shoreline" means a line projected across the westernmost
edge of the westernmost pilings, along a northerly-southerly
axis, provided that if the concept plan submitted pursuant to
Subsection H(1) below indicates that the applicant does not
intend to construct new decking over all of such pilings, then
for such area of the subject property the shoreline shall be
deemed to be the westerly edge of the development actually
proposed by such applicant.
(c) With respect to any other portion of a property, the term
"shoreline" means either:
[1] The westernmost edge of the top of any retaining wall or
bulkhead that abuts such portion of the subject property
and which was in place in the Hudson River as of July 1,
1989; or
[2] In the absence of any such retaining wall or bulkhead, the
mean high water line of the Hudson River along the
riverbank of such portion of the subject property.
(d) The provisions of Subsection F(9)(c) above also shall be
applicable to any upland or landfill portion of the subject
property which lies inland (easterly) from existing decking or
existing vertical deck pilings, but which, under the concept
plan submitted under Subsection H(1) below, will not abut any
new or existing decking.
(e) If the subject property contains coves or inlets, then the term
"shoreline" shall include the water edge of any new decking,
retaining walls or bulkheads proposed to be constructed along
the banks of such coves or inlets. If no new or replacement
decking, retaining walls or bulkheads are proposed to be
constructed or replaced along any bank of such cove or inlet,
then the term "shoreline" shall apply to the water edge of any
existing decking, retaining wall or bulkhead situated on such
bank. If no decking, retaining wall or bulkhead exists along the
bank of a cove or inlet, and no new decking, retaining wall or
bulkhead is proposed to be constructed or replaced along such
bank, then the shoreline along such bank shall be the mean
high waterline along such bank.

(b) Upon receipt of a report from the Planning Board, the Village
Board shall set a date for and conduct a public hearing in
accordance with § 295-157C of this chapter for the purpose of
considering an amendment to the Zoning Map121 to change the
zoning district classification of the subject property to MW-B
designation. The Village Board may attach such conditions as
are reasonably necessary or appropriate to assure that the
goals, objectives, requirements and standards of the MW-B
District classification, including, without limitation, those set
forth in Subsection G above, are met and achieved. The Village
Board may require that any or all of such conditions be
incorporated in a covenant or covenants satisfactory to the
Village Attorney and executed by the owner of the subject
property and recorded in the Westchester County Clerk's
office, Land Records Division. In the event that a covenant or
portion of a covenant is held to be unenforceable, the validity
or enforceability of the remaining portion of such covenant or
other covenants shall not be affected. If approved by the
Village Board, the zoning amendment, with conditions, if any,
shall be enacted by the Village Board as an amendment to the
Zoning Map in accordance with the procedures set forth in
§ 295-157 of this chapter and such regulations as the Village
has adopted or may in the future adopt. Each newly created
MW-B District shall be considered a separate MW-B District for
the purposes of this chapter, regardless of whether or not it is
located adjacent to another MW-B District.
I. Incentive density.
(1) General provisions.
(a) The Village Board has determined that, because of their size
and riverfront location, properties eligible for MW-B
designation encompass a major portion of the Village's
121. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Village offices.
§ 295-84 TATTOOING § 295-84
257:605
development potential, that such properties represent the
most significant opportunity to encourage the development of
middle-income and senior citizen dwelling units in the Village
and thereby achieve certain of the public purposes of the MWB
District classification; and that, therefore, to the extent that
the development of large riverfront properties fails to achieve
such public purpose, the opportunity to achieve such purpose
will be reduced.
(b) The Village Board has determined that, in order to achieve
additional real property tax revenues needed to offset
additional costs of public services that may result from the
scale of development permitted in an MW-B District, it is
appropriate to encourage the construction in such district of
dwelling units that will be owned in fee simple.
(c) The Village Board has determined that, in order to encourage
the provision of business office uses that are conducive to longterm
support by the occupants thereof for public and
community facilities and for amenities in an MW-B District; the
establishment of flexible employee work hours and other
traffic-control measures resulting in reduced traffic
congestion; and reduction of traffic resulting from delivery,
trash removal and other services to occupants, it is appropriate
to provide an incentive for the provision in such district of
business office facilities occupied principally by a single
tenant, owner-occupant or other single occupant.
(d) In order to provide an incentive that will encourage the
development of middle-income dwelling units, senior citizen
dwelling units or dwelling units that are to be owned in fee
simple, or a combination of such types of dwelling units, the
Village Board may allow, by special use permit and following a
public hearing held on notice duly published and given as
provided in § 295-143 of this chapter, an increased residential
density and floor area ratio as set forth in Subsection I(3)
below, subject to the provision of such types of dwelling units
as public benefit features, as more fully set forth in Subsection
I(2) and (3) below.
(e) In order to provide an incentive that will encourage the
provision of business office facilities that are to be occupied
principally by a single tenant, owner-occupant or other single
occupant, the Village Board may allow, by special use permit
and following a public hearing held on notice duly published
and given as provided in § 295-143 of this chapter, an
increased floor area ratio for business and professional office
use as more fully set forth in Subsection I(2) and (3) below.
(f) The Village Board also may, in its discretion, choose not to
allow any incentive increase in an MW-B District. Action by the
§ 295-84 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-84
257:606
Village Board on an application for any such increase shall be
taken only after review of the proposed public benefit features
by the Planning Board and submission of a report and
recommendation by said Board to the Village Board. Final
site plan approval by the Planning Board shall not occur until
after the special use permit determination by the Village Board
with respect to any proposed incentive density. The Village
Board may, in its discretion, conduct such special use permit
procedures concurrently with the procedures for change of
zone set forth above in this chapter. The Village Board may
require that the applicant execute a declaration or agreement,
to be recorded in the Westchester County Clerk's office, Land
Records Division, assuring the permanency of the public
feature or features for which incentive density is approved.
Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, and
in order to preserve the opportunity to review the potential
density of development in the light of changing demographic,
economic and development conditions, the right to apply for a
special use permit allowing incentive density with respect to
a property in an MW-B District shall expire one year following
the date of action by the Village Board changing the zoning
district classification of such property to MW-B designation.
(2) Public benefit features. The public benefit features for which
incentive density increases may be granted in an MW-B District are
set forth in Subsection I(2)(a), (b) and (c) below:
(a) Middle-income dwelling units.
[1] The provision of dwelling units limited as to price or
rental, and limited in occupancy to middle-income families,
shall constitute a public benefit feature under this
Subsection I(2). Such dwelling units may be provided in or
outside of the subject property, and must be made
available to Village of Hastings-on-Hudson residents on a
first-priority basis. A family shall be considered a middleincome
family if its aggregate income, including the total
of all current annual income of all family members from
any source whatsoever at the time of application, but
excluding the earnings of working minors (under 21 years
of age) attending school full time, shall not exceed the
following multiple of the median annual wages paid by the
Village to all of its full-time employees during the
preceding calendar year:
Size of Family
Multiple of Median Annual
Wages
1-person family 1.1
2-person family 1.4
§ 295-84 TATTOOING § 295-84
257:607
Size of Family
Multiple of Median Annual
Wages
3-person family 1.7
4-person family 1.8
5-person family 2.0
6-person family 2.2
7-person family 2.4
8-or-more-person family 2.5
[2] For property or other investments that are not returning
measurable income (excluding normal household personal
possessions), a yearly income of 8% of the fair market
value of the investment shall be included in the family's
aggregate income. A "middle-income dwelling unit" shall
be defined as a unit having a monthly rent which, after
excluding utilities (gas, oil, electricity, water and sewage)
does not exceed 1.75% of the applicable maximum annual
family income determined under the preceding sentence;
or a unit having a gross sale price not exceeding two times
such income. Upon subsequent resale or re-rental, such
dwelling units shall remain subject to the limitations and
requirements of this Subsection I(2)(a), or to such other or
additional requirements as the Village Board may establish
as a condition of the special permit, to assure that the
objectives of this Subsection I(2)(a) are achieved in a
permanent manner. At the time of granting any special use
permit in connection with dwelling units limited in
occupancy to middle-income families, the Village Board
may impose conditions providing, without limitation, for
variation by the Village Board of any of the foregoing
income, rental or price levels by up to 15% to reflect
updated demographic, census or marketing data; or
detailed eligibility rules supplementing the provisions of
this Subsection I(2)(a) as shall be necessary and
appropriate in order to implement and achieve the
purposes of such provisions.
(b) The provision of dwelling units limited in occupancy to senior
citizen households, with priority for Hastings-on-Hudson
residents, also shall constitute a public benefit feature under
this Subsection I(2). Such dwelling units shall be suitable for
senior citizen occupancy, and shall remain subject to the
limitations and requirements of this Subsection I(2)(b), or to
such other or additional requirements as the Village Board may
establish as a condition of the special use permit, to assure that
the objectives of this subsection I(2)(b) are achieved in a
permanent manner. In considering such suitability, the Village
Board shall take into account the nature and extent of special
§ 295-84 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-84
257:608
features provided for senior citizen use both within the
individual dwelling units and in the development as a whole,
the availability of a variety of unit sizes, the location of such
units within the development and in relation to ease of access
to convenience retail and personal service stores, the proposed
pricing of the senior citizen units and the effectiveness and
fairness of the proposed priority arrangement for Hastings-on-
Hudson residents. For the purposes of this section, a "senior
citizen household" is defined as a household in which at least
one member residing or proposing to reside in a reserved
dwelling unit has attained the age of 65 years or more on the
date that such household initially occupies the dwelling unit.
At the time of granting any special use permit in connection
with dwelling units limited in occupancy to senior citizen
households, the Village Board may impose conditions providing
for more detailed eligibility rules supplementing the provisions
of this Subsection I(2)(b) as shall be necessary and appropriate
in order to implement and achieve the purposes of such
provisions.
(c) The provision of more than 85 dwelling units (including but not
limited to townhouses) intended to be owned in fee simple shall
constitute a public benefit feature under this Subsection I(2).
Such units shall remain subject to the limitations of this
Subsection I(2)(c), or to such other or additional requirements
as the Village Board may establish as a condition of the special
permit, to assure that the objectives of this Subsection I(2)(c)
are achieved in a permanent manner.
(d) The provision of business office facilities in which not less than
65% of the permitted gross floor area, as the same may be
increased under this Subsection I(2) and (3) below, is to be
occupied by a single tenant, owner-occupant or other single
occupant shall constitute a public benefit feature under this
Subsection I(2). Such office facilities shall remain subject to
the limitations of this Subsection I(2)(d), and to such other or
additional requirements as the Village Board may establish as
a condition of the special use permit, to assure, so far as is
practicable, that the objectives of this Subsection I(2)(d) are
achieved on a long-term basis.
(3) Amount of increase.
(a) For the provision of public benefits described in Subsection
I(2)(a), (b) or (c) above, or for the provision of a combination of
such public benefits, the number of permitted dwelling units
determined under Subsection F(1) above may be increased by
up to an additional 16 1/2% in the aggregate, and the
maximum floor area ratio set forth in Subsection F(3)(a) above
[excluding any increase thereof under Subsection I(3)(b)
§ 295-84 TATTOOING § 295-84
257:609
below] may be increased by up to an additional 13% in the
aggregate.
(b) For the provision of public benefits described in Subsection
I(2)(d) above, the maximum floor area ratio set forth in
Subsection F(3)(c) of this section may be increased by an
additional 12%, provided that all of such increase shall be used
for business office facilities occupied as described in said
Subsection I(2)(d). If a twelve-percent increase in floor area
ratio is approved under the preceding sentence, then the
maximum floor area ratio set forth in Subsection F(3)(a) of this
section, as the same may be increased under Subsection I(3)(a)
above in this section, shall be increased to the extent necessary
to reflect the additional permitted floor area resulting from
such twelve-percent increase.
(4) General criteria for incentive density. In determining the specific
amount of density incentive increase that may be granted, if any,
the Village Board shall take into consideration the conditions and
standards set forth in § 295-87 and the following:
(a) The number, extent and combination of public benefit features
to be provided.
(b) The need for the provision of such public benefits by the
applicant, at that time, and the relative merits of alternative
means of obtaining such benefits then available to the Village.
(c) The degree of compatibility of such public benefit features with
other goals, objectives, limitations, standards and
requirements and guidelines set forth in this chapter with
respect to development in an MW-B District.
(d) The quality and variety of design of the proposed public benefit
features, and assurances of quality of construction of the
dwelling units, as determined by the Planning Board in the
course of its review under Subsection K below.
(e) The amount of incentive density increase necessary to more
than offset the cost or economic penalty of providing the public
benefit features, thereby creating the incentive for providing
such features.
(f) With respect to middle-income or senior citizen dwelling units,
the effectiveness and fairness of the procedure for determining
eligibility for occupancy of such dwelling units and the
proposed priority arrangement for Village residents.
(g) The effectiveness of legal mechanisms for assuring that the
reservation of dwelling units for their public benefit purpose
will be permanent.
§ 295-84 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-84
257:610
(h) The integration of the proposed middle-income, senior citizen
or fee simple ownership dwelling units into the overall
development or neighborhood in which they are to be located.
(i) With respect to middle-income or senior citizen dwelling units,
the suitability of the proposed location, and equipping of such
dwelling units.
(j) With respect to dwelling units intended to be owned in fee
simple, the anticipated level of real property tax revenues to be
generated by such dwelling units.
(k) With respect to business office facilities that are to be occupied
principally by a single tenant or owner-occupant, the degree of
assurance that such occupancy actually will occur and the
probable duration of such occupancy, as evidenced by, among
other things, executed leases, agreements and other
documents.
(5) Economic analysis. In order to facilitate the economic analysis of an
application for density increase, the Village Board may engage its
own independent experts either to prepare such analyses or to
review those prepared by the applicant. The reasonable cost of
such expert assistance shall be reimbursed to the Village by the
applicant.
J. Site development plan approval in an MW-B District.
(1) Application. After the Village Board has amended the Village
Zoning Map122 to change the zoning district classification of a
property to MW-B designation, the owner shall submit an
application for site development plan approval to the Planning
Board in accordance with §§ 295-104 through 295-114 of this
chapter. In addition to the information and materials required to be
submitted to the Planning Board under § 295-106 of this chapter,
such application shall include or be supplemented by such
computer-assisted design representations as the Planning Board
may request in connection with its review of the application. The
Planning Board shall take into account any conditions imposed on
the applicant by the Village Board in connection with the Zoning
Map amendment. The Planning Board may incorporate any
conditions of site development plan approval in declarations or
agreements satisfactory to the Village Attorney, to be executed by
the applicant and recorded in the Westchester County Clerk's
office, Land Records Division.
(2) Standards of review. The Planning Board shall not approve an
application for site plan approval for property in an MW-B District
unless the standards for site plan approval set forth in § 295-109
below are met, and unless the Planning Board ensures through
122. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Village offices.
§ 295-84 TATTOOING § 295-84
257:611
conditions imposed in connection with such approval that the
additional requirements and standards set forth in Subsection K
are met. As a condition of site plan approval, the Planning Board
may require one or more bonds or letters of credit containing
terms satisfactory to said Board as security for implementation
of the traffic, infrastructure, amenities, landscaping, public open
space and recreation elements of the approved site development
plan and related environmental mitigation measures. The Planning
Board also may require the imposition of fees for the inspection
of construction on the subject property. The foregoing provisions
of this section concerning security and fees shall be implemented
in such manner as to avoid duplication of any similar measures
previously required by the Village Board in connection with any
Zoning Map amendment or special permit proceeding.
K. Design review. Because of the visual prominence of development in an
MW-B District, the importance of preserving dramatic views that may
be affected by such development, and the proximity of the riverfront to
the commercial and civic center of the Village, the Planning Board as
part of the site plan review process shall apply the special design
guidelines set forth below in this section. It is the objective of the
design guidelines to establish a general design framework that will
preserve and enhance scenic views, assure an attractive environment
for public access to the waterfront, respect the architectural character
and scale of buildings in the Village center area and preserve the
economic value of properties in such area. In reviewing applications for
site plan approval for properties in an MW-B District, the Planning
Board may attach more or less weight to any guideline in relation to
other guidelines, as may be appropriate under the particular
circumstances presented by a specific application. The guidelines are
set forth in Subsection K(1) through (4) below:
(1) Architectural character and preservation of views. Development in
an MW-B District shall be designed in such a way as to respect the
scale and character of the existing Village, preserve and enhance
views of the Hudson River and the Palisades as seen from upland
areas and enhance views of the subject property as seen from the
Palisades and the river. In applying such standards, the Planning
Board shall consider the extent to which an application for site plan
approval contains architectural features consistent with such
standards and with the objectives and purposes set forth herein,
including, without limitation, the following architectural features:
(a) Design of buildings as an integrated part of overall site design
related to the downtown area of the Village and other
surrounding development, and to topographical conditions.
(b) Orientation of taller buildings in an east/west direction in order
to avoid the creation of high, continuous visual barriers.
§ 295-84 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-84
257:612
(c) The siting of buildings to respect important views north, south
and west from public facilities such as Fulton Park, the Village
Municipal Building and Library, the Warburton Avenue Bridge,
Washington Avenue and Warburton Avenue south of
Washington Avenue, and from on-site areas devoted to park,
esplanade, retail or community use.
(d) The siting of taller buildings in proximity to upland areas of
higher elevation lying inland of the subject property.
(e) Where appropriate because of existing or potential uses on
adjacent dry land areas, the provision of adequate setbacks
along boundaries with such areas, to allow for landscaped
buffers and screening.
(f) Limitation of length of buildings and variation of building
heights, including stepdown of building heights in a riverward
direction.
(g) Use of setbacks and indentations of walls and facades to help
achieve a pedestrian-scaled environment, particularly in areas
devoted to park, esplanade, retail or community use.
(h) Use of pitched roofs, dormer windows, gables and other
architectural elements in order to provide visual interest and
reduce the apparent scale of the development.
(2) Landscaping. In addition to the requirements set forth above in
§§ 295-45, 295-46 and 295-32, there shall be a coordinated
landscape design incorporating the landscape treatment for all
open spaces, walks, access roads and parking areas in an MW-B
District into a continuous and integrated design, which shall relate
properly to proposed buildings. Open spaces shall be located so as
to take into consideration existing views and the creation and
preservation of centrally located landscaped areas, parks and
plazas. In applying such standards, the Planning Board shall
consider the manner and extent to which an application for site
plan approval contains landscaping features consistent with such
standards and with the purposes set forth herein, including,
without limitation, the following landscape features:
(a) Landscape treatment of plazas, pedestrian areas, esplanades,
courtyards, park areas and similar areas, including a mix of
shade trees and other plant material such as ground cover and
shrubs, with proper regard for factors such as microclimate,
function of area and required maintenance, in determining the
species, scale and planting pattern.
(b) Screening new development on the subject property from
adjacent properties and appropriate screening between
residential and nonresidential uses within the subject property.
§ 295-84 TATTOOING § 295-84
257:613
(c) The use in esplanades, walks, plazas, parking lots and other
surface areas of paving materials that offer some variety of
pigments and textures that are in harmony with nearby
proposed buildings and paved areas and are safe for
pedestrian traffic, including the handicapped.
(d) The use of covered and trellised outdoor spaces such as
loggias, arcades and colonnades in order to provide shade,
transition between indoors and outdoors and to add visual
interest, shadow and depth to building elevations.
(e) Planting of sidewalks on public or private streets with
regularly spaced, salt-tolerant shade trees.
(f) Softening of the visual impact of parking areas by screening of
all parking areas from street view, by interrupting continuous
rows of parking spaces with planting, by creating planted
canopies over parking areas and by compliance with additional
requirements set forth in § 295-32 of this chapter.
(3) Lighting. All exterior lighting in an MW-B District, including the
lighting of signs, shall be directed away from residential units and
from adjoining streets and should be so located and shielded that
the light sources are not directly visible from any adjoining street
or property or from the Hudson River and that any such
illumination does not cause glare observable from neighboring
properties. The Planning Board may restrict hours of lighting and
types of fixtures.
(4) Signs.
(a) Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, signs may be
lighted, provided that the lights are so located and shielded
that the sources are not directly visible from points beyond the
boundaries of the lot on which they are located. In no case,
however, shall such signs include any flashing or intermittent
lights; lights of changing degrees of intensity; illuminated
tubing; or strings of light outlining rooflines, doors, windows or
wall edges of any buildings; nor shall such signs be of a type
that has the whole or any part in motion by rotating, fluttering
or any other means, except that customary seasonal lighting
and decorations shall be permitted.
(b) Signs shall not obscure any sign displayed by a public
authority, nor interfere with access of light or air to any
window in any building, nor obstruct any opening in any
building required by law for ingress or egress.
(c) No signs or lighting of signs shall be permitted if the approving
authority finds that they may be mistaken for traffic signal
devices.

§ 295-85. Personal Wireless Service Facilities Overlay (PWSF)
District. [Added 2-17-1998 by L.L. No. 1-1998]
(d) In addition to compliance with the above, a sign plan must be
submitted to the Planning Board, as part of the application for
site plan approval, describing the size, number, content and
placement of all signs to be used in the MW-B District. The use
of all signs must be in accordance with the general design
guidelines as set forth above in Subsection K(1), (2) and (3) of
this section.
L. Applicability of other provisions to an MW-B District.
(1) General regulations. All the general regulations set forth in this
chapter shall apply in their entirety to an MW-B District except as
expressly set forth in the provisions of Subsections A through L,
inclusive, of this section, and except as set forth below:

F. Criteria for special permit applications. Applicants for special permits
for establishment or construction of personal wireless service facilities
shall meet all of the following criteria:
(1) Necessity. The proposed personal wireless service facility is
required to provide service to locations within the Village that the
applicant is not able to serve with existing facilities that are located
within and outside the Village, by collocation and otherwise.
(2) Collocation.
§ 295-85 TATTOOING § 295-85
257:619
(a) The collocation of existing personal wireless service facilities
only within the Personal Wireless Service Facilities Overlay
District shall be strongly preferred to the construction of new
personal wireless service facilities.
(b) Approval of a proposal to share space on an existing personal
wireless service facility within the Personal Wireless Service
Facilities Overlay District shall be conditioned upon the
applicant's agreement to pay the reasonable costs of adapting
an existing facility to a new shared use. These costs can
include but are not limited to structural reinforcement,
prevention of transmission or receiver interference, additional
site screening and other changes required to accommodate
shared use.
(c) If a new site for a personal wireless service facility is proposed,
the applicant must demonstrate that the proposed personal
wireless service facility cannot be accommodated on an
existing personal wireless service facility within the Village or
on an existing facility in another municipality due to one or
more of the following reasons:
[1] Service to the locations to which the applicant seeks to
provide service cannot be provided by existing facilities
within or outside the Village.
[2] Adequate and reliable service cannot be provided from
existing sites in a financially and technologically feasible
manner consistent with the applicant's system
requirements.
[3] Existing sites cannot accommodate the proposed personal
wireless service facility due to structural or other
engineering limitations, such as frequency
incompatibilities.
[4] The applicant has been unable to come to a reasonable
agreement to collocate on another personal wireless
service facility. The applicant shall provide the names,
addresses, phone numbers and FAX numbers of other
service providers approached, along with a written
statement as to why an agreement to collocate could not
be reached.
[5] Other reasons make it impracticable to place the proposed
equipment on an existing and approved personal wireless
service facility within the Village or existing facilities in
other municipalities.
(3) Location on existing tall structure. Where collocation is
unavailable, location of a personal wireless service facility on a
preexisting tall structure, such as a water tank, utility pole, church
§ 295-85 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-85
257:620
spire, etc., shall be preferred to the construction of a tower or
monopole. The applicant must demonstrate that it has made good
faith efforts to locate the personal wireless service facility on each
existing tall structure in the Personal Wireless Service Facilities
Overlay District, but that, for physical, technical and/or financial
reasons, or because of the inability to obtain a lease, the personal
wireless service facility cannot be accommodated on any existing
tall structure in the PWSF District.
(4) Maximum height and size.
(a) Unless the Federal Communications Commission promulgates
rules to the contrary or the applicant demonstrates to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board that a greater height is
necessary, the maximum height for an antenna mounted on
another structure shall be six feet above the highest point of
the building or structure on which it is installed. The maximum
height for a tower or monopole shall be 125 feet above ground
level or the minimum height necessary to provide service to
locations that the applicant is not able to serve with existing
facilities within and outside the Village, whichever is less. The
Planning Board may permit a tower or monopole to be higher
than the minimum necessary to provide service to such
locations if such additional height is necessary to
accommodate collocation of other personal wireless service
facilities on the same tower or monopole.
(b) Accessory structures shall be the minimum size necessary to
house the equipment for the PWSF, but in no event shall they
be larger than 250 square feet (inside dimensions) per carrier.
(5) Setbacks. Personal wireless service facilities, including accessory
structures, shall be set back as far as practicable from the nearest
residential dwelling.
(6) Security and signage. Personal wireless service facilities shall be
fenced or otherwise secured in a manner that prevents
unauthorized access by the general public. A sign no larger than
two square feet shall be posted on a personal wireless service
facility to provide adequate notification to persons in the immediate
area of the presence of an antenna that has transmit capabilities.
The sign shall also contain the name(s) and emergency telephone
number(s) of the owner(s) and operator(s) of the personal wireless
service facility. In addition, if the personal wireless service facility
is mounted on a roof, any door having access to the roof shall bear a
similar sign. If a fence is required around the personal wireless
service facility, the entrance to the enclosure shall bear a similar
sign.
(7) Placement. Unless wall-mounted on an existing roof-mounted
mechanical enclosure or similar appurtenance, all antennas
§ 295-85 TATTOOING § 295-85
257:621
mounted on a roof shall be located so that visibility of the antenna
is limited to the greatest extent practicable, consistent with the
needs of the antenna to transmit an unobstructed signal. Antennas
wall-mounted on a roof-mount mechanical enclosure or similar
appurtenance shall not exceed the height of the appurtenance at
the point of installation.
(8) Future collocation. New personal wireless service facilities shall be
designed to accommodate additional antennas for purposes of
collocating.
(9) Design guidelines. The proposed personal wireless service facility
shall meet the design guidelines set forth in Subsection G.
(10) Structural engineering standards. The proposed personal wireless
service facility shall meet the structural engineering standards
referred to in Subsection C(10).

Administration (FAA) painting or marking shall either have a
galvanized finish or be painted gray or blue-gray above the
surrounding tree line and gray, green or tannish brown below
the surrounding tree line.
(b) If an antenna is installed on a structure other than a tower or
monopole, the antenna and supporting electrical and
mechanical equipment must be of a neutral color that is
identical to or compatible with the color of the supporting
structure, so as to make the antenna and related equipment as
visually unobtrusive as possible.
(2) Illumination. No signals, lights or illumination shall be permitted on
personal wireless service facilities unless required by the FAA or
other federal, state or local authority. Lighting may be permitted,
however, at an accessory equipment shelter if the Planning Board
determines that it is necessary for the security of the personal
wireless services facility. When lighting is used, it shall be shielded
to prevent undue impact on the surrounding neighborhood.
(3) Architectural compatibility.
(a) Where a personal wireless service facility is to be attached to
an existing building or structure, such facility shall be
§ 295-85 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-85
257:622
integrated into such existing building or structure in a manner
that blends with the architectural characteristics of the
building or structure to the maximum extent practicable.
(b) Accessory structures shall be designed to blend with the
architectural characteristics of neighboring residential
structures.
(4) Landscaping.
(a) Accessory structures shall be landscaped with evergreen trees
or shrubs of sufficient size and density to screen the accessory

(b) For towers or monopoles, vegetative screening shall be
provided to effectively screen the tower base, including
fencing. At a minimum, screening shall consist of one row of
native evergreen shrubs or evergreen trees capable of forming
a continuous hedge at least 10 feet in height within two years
after planting. Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the
maximum extent practicable and may be used as a substitute of
or in supplement toward meeting landscaping requirements.
Additional screening may be required to screen portions of the
structure from nearby residential property or important views.
All landscaping shall be properly maintained to ensure good
health and viability.
(5) Visibility. All personal wireless service facilities shall be sited to
have the least possible adverse visual effect on the environment.
(6) Signage. The signage required by Subsection F(6) must be
approved by the Architectural Review Board. No other signage,
including advertising, shall be permitted on personal wireless
service facilities, unless required by federal or state regulation.
H. Technical assistance. The Planning Board may obtain professional
planning, technical or engineering advice to assist it in its review of an
application under this section. The expenses of this professional advice
shall be paid by the applicant.
I. Planning Board determination.
(1) The Planning Board may approve, approve with conditions or
disapprove the application for a special permit within 62 days after
the public hearing. The period in which the Planning Board may
take action may be extended with the consent of the applicant.
(2) In granting a special permit under this section, the Planning Board
may impose reasonable conditions that are directly related to and
incidental to the proposed personal wireless service facility.

A. Purpose. The Comprehensive Plan of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson
adopted in 2011 identified large tracts located within the Village's
Gateways as representing important viewsheds along major roadways
and also indicated that these parcels contain important natural
resources which should be protected and preserved. The use of
clustering for future development of these parcels will help to preserve
the natural and scenic qualities of these parcels and preserve the
character of the Gateways to the Village.
B. Authorization. In connection with any application for subdivision of a
property within the Gateway Cluster Overlay District, the Planning
Board of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson is hereby authorized,
pursuant to New York State Village Law § 7-738 to modify applicable

woodlands, scenic views and wetlands. Any subdivision designed under
this article shall indicate on the final plat that it is a cluster subdivision.
C. Mandatory clustering. The Planning Board shall require an applicant to
submit a cluster plan utilizing the provisions of this section and § 7-738
for the development of parcels four acres or greater in size located
within the Gateway Cluster Overlay District. The Planning Board, at its
discretion, may mandate cluster development of a parcel of four acres
or less in size in order to preserve the natural and scenic qualities of
open lands.
D. Density determination. A cluster development shall result in a
permitted number of building lots or dwelling units which shall in no
case exceed the number which could be permitted, in the Planning
Board's judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots conforming to
the minimum lot size and density requirements of the Zoning Code
applicable in the underlying zoning district. The applicant shall submit
a conventional subdivision layout to determine the maximum density for
the cluster subdivision. The conventional layout must consider
environmental constraints on development as well as roads, utilities
and other attributes which would impact the density of a conventional
subdivision.

Board, the buffer can be maintained in its natural state or
landscaped pursuant to an approved landscape plan.
(4) Permitted uses shall include all uses permitted in the underlying
zoning district and as permitted therein.
(5) The cluster subdivision shall result in restricted open spaces as
determined by the Planning Board. All open space, recreation or
common areas shall be restricted, managed and maintained in
accordance with a form of legal ownership and restrictions to be
approved by the Planning Board and the Village Attorney.
(6) The procedure to be followed for approval of a cluster subdivision
shall be the same as for approval of a conventional subdivision
pursuant to Article XIII of this chapter, and all provisions thereof
not modified by this section shall apply.
(7) The Planning Board shall ensure that clustering hereunder
preserves the natural and scenic qualities of open space lands,
including open meadows, woodlands, scenic views and wetlands.

257:648
§ 295-108. Planning Board site plans.
In furtherance of any investigation, or in connection with any map, report
or recommendations made by the Planning Board relating to planning and
development of the Village, the Planning Board may, on its own initiative,
propose a general or specific site plan for a particular area where site plan
approval may be required in the future, using as a guide the requirements
of this chapter.
§ 295-109. Standards for site plan approval.
In acting upon any application for site plan approval, the Planning Board
shall consider the site layout and overall appearance of all buildings,
structures and land in the proposed development in relation to the public
health, safety and general welfare and the comfort and convenience of
the public in general and the residents of the immediate neighborhood in
particular. The Planning Board shall not approve any site plan unless the
Planning Board determines that that site plan, as modified by the Planning
Board and as subject to conditions imposed by the Planning Board, meets
the following standards:
C. Within 62 days after such hearing, the Planning Board shall review and
approve, approve with modifications or disapprove the site plan;
provided, however, that the time within which the Planning Board must
render its decision may be extended by mutual consent of the applicant
and the Planning Board.
D. The decision of the Planning Board shall be filed in the office of the
Village Clerk within five business days after such decision is rendered,
and a copy of the decision shall be mailed to the applicant. [Amended
6-15-1999 by L.L. No. 3-1999]
E. Within 15 days of the approval of a site plan, the Planning Board shall
file with the Building Inspector one copy of the approved plan, with the
approval noted thereon, and one copy of the Planning Board's
resolution approving the site plan, including a list of any conditions to
which the approval is subject. One copy of the plan and resolution shall
be made available to the applicant.
A. The site layout and overall appearance of all buildings, structures and
land in the proposed development are such that they will have a
harmonious relationship with existing or permitted development of
contiguous land and of adjacent neighborhoods and will have no
material adverse effect upon the desirability of such neighborhoods for
the uses contemplated by the comprehensive zoning plan.
B. The historical, scenic and community character of the Village and of
individual buildings and sites shall be preserved.
C. The environment, including air, water, land and living resources, shall
be protected to the maximum extent practicable.
§ 295-107 TATTOOING § 295-109
257:649
§ 295-110. Site plan conditions.
The Planning Board shall attach such conditions and safeguards to the
approval of any site plan as are, in its opinion, necessary to assure initial
and continued compliance with all applicable provisions of this chapter,
including a requirement that the applicant post a bond under such terms
and conditions as the Planning Board shall determine.
§ 295-111. Expiration of approvals.
§ 295-112. Reservation of parkland.
D. The safety of pedestrian and vehicular traffic will be ensured.
E. The parking and loading requirements of this chapter are met.
F. The purposes and intent of this chapter will be met, to the end that the
value of buildings and land will be conserved and the most appropriate
use of land will be encouraged.
A. Subject to the provisions of Subsection C below, site plan approvals
granted pursuant to this chapter shall automatically lapse and become
null and void if a building permit in accordance with the approved site
plan is not obtained within 12 months after the site plan approval or, if
no building permit is required, if a certificate of occupancy in
accordance with the approved site plan is not obtained within 12
months after the site plan approval.
B. Subject to the provisions of Subsection C below, site plans approved
before the effective date of this chapter will lapse and become null and
void if a building permit in accordance with the approved site plan is
not obtained within 12 months after the effective date of this chapter or,
if no building permit is required, if a certificate of occupancy in
accordance with the approved site plan is not obtained within 12
months after the effective date of this chapter.
C. Upon written application, the Planning Board may, at its discretion,
extend the approval of a site plan where, in the opinion of the Planning
Board, there are reasonable grounds for granting the extension. Each
extension, however, may not be for a period longer than 12 months.
A. General standards.
(1) The Planning Board may require that a site plan containing
residential units also contain a park or parks suitably located for
playground or other recreational purposes.
(2) Before the Planning Board may require that land be reserved for
park, playground or other recreational purposes, the Planning
Board must make a finding that such requirement is warranted.
Such a finding shall include an evaluation of the present and
anticipated future needs for park and recreational purposes in the
§ 295-109 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-112
257:650
§ 295-112.1. Affordable and workforce housing set-aside. [Added
7-17-2001 by L.L. No. 3-2001; amended 2-1-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011;
1-8-2013 by L.L. No. 1-2013]
Village, based on the projected population growth to which the
particular site plan will contribute.
B. Ownership of park area. The ownership of reservations for park
purposes shall be clearly indicated on the site plan and established in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board so as to assure their proper
future continuation and maintenance.
C. Cash payment in lieu of reservation.
(1) Where the Planning Board makes a finding that the proposed site
plan presents a proper case for requiring a park or parks suitably
located for playground or other recreational purposes, but that a
suitable park or parks of adequate size cannot be properly located
on such site plan, the Planning Board may require, as a condition to
approval of the site plan, a payment to the Village of a sum of
money determined by the Board of Trustees.
(2) In making the determination of suitability, the Planning Board shall
assess the size and suitability of lands shown on the site plan which
could be possible locations for park or recreational facilities, as
well as practical factors, including whether there is a need for
additional facilities in the immediate neighborhood.
(3) Any moneys required by the Planning Board in lieu of land for park,
playground or other recreational purposes pursuant to this section
shall be deposited into a trust fund to be used by the Village
exclusively for park, playground or other recreational purposes,
including the acquisition of property.
(4) Credit for land set aside in subdivision approval. Notwithstanding
Subsections A through C of this section, if the land included in a
site plan under review is a portion of a subdivision plat that has
been reviewed and approved, the Planning Board shall credit the
applicant for any land set aside for parkland or money donated in
lieu thereof under such subdivision plat approval. In the event of
resubdivision of such plat, nothing shall preclude the additional
reservation of parkland or money donated in lieu thereof.
D. This section shall not apply to affordable housing units or workforce
housing units, as defined in this chapter. [Added 1-8-2013 by L.L. No.
1-2013]
A. Set-aside requirement. Before the Planning Board may approve a site
plan for a residential development containing eight or more dwelling
units, whether in single-family, two-family or multifamily buildings,
such site plan shall show affordable and workforce housing units as
follows:
§ 295-112 TATTOOING § 295-112.1
257:651
(1) Fifteen percent of all units in such development shall meet either
the definition of an "affordable housing unit" or a "workforce
housing unit." At least 2/3 of these units shall be affordable housing
units. The remaining 1/3 may be either affordable housing units or
workforce housing units. The calculation of the required number of
affordable and workforce housing units shall in each case be
rounded to the closest whole number, that is, 1.1 to 1.4 units would
be rounded down to one unit, and 1.5 to 1.9 units would be rounded
up to two units. [Amended 1-20-2015 by L.L. No. 1-2015]
(2) Affordable housing units and workforce housing units shall
generally be distributed evenly throughout the development.
Notwithstanding, the Planning Board may use discretion in
reviewing and approving distribution.
(3) The exterior appearance of affordable housing units and workforce
housing units shall not distinguish them as a class from other units.
(4) Affordable housing units and workforce housing units shall be
distributed among one-, two-, three- or four-bedroom units in the
same proportion as all other units in the development, unless a
different proportion is approved by the Planning Board as being
better suited to the housing needs of the Village.
(5) Alternatives to set-aside. There is a strong preference that units be
on site. However, where the Planning Board determines that the
on-site location of affordable and workforce housing units is not
practical, the Planning Board may:
(a) Require the applicant to construct the affordable and
workforce housing units at another location in the Village; or
(b) Require the applicant to pay a fee equal to the cost necessary
to acquire a site and to develop the required number of
affordable and workforce housing units into a special
affordable housing fund.
(6) Minimum floor area.
(a) The minimum gross floor area per affordable and workforce
housing unit shall not be less than 80% of the average floor
area of nonrestricted housing units in the development and not
less than the following unless the applicant can establish to the
satisfaction of the Village that the development is subject to
maximum floor area requirements imposed by federal, state or
county funding sources or a different floor area requirement is
approved by the Planning Board as being better suited to the
housing needs of the Village:
§ 295-112.1 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-112.1
257:652
Dwelling Unit
Minimum Gross Floor Area
(square feet)
Efficiency 450
One-bedroom 675
Two-bedroom 850
Three-bedroom 1,100 (must include at least 1.5
baths)
Four-bedroom 1,300 (must include at least 1.5
baths)
(b) For purposes of this section, paved terraces or balconies may
be counted toward the minimum gross floor area requirement
in an amount not to exceed 1/3 of the square footage of such
terraces or balconies.
(7) Occupancy standards. For affordable and workforce housing units,
the following occupancy schedule shall apply, so long as these
standards comply with the New York State Building, Fire and
Property Maintenance codes:
Number of Bedrooms Number of Persons
Efficiency Minimum 1; maximum 1
One-bedroom Minimum 1; maximum 3
Two-bedroom Minimum 2; maximum 5
Three-bedroom Minimum 3; maximum 7
Four-bedroom Minimum 4; maximum 9.
(8) Reduced lot size. Notwithstanding Article IX of this chapter, a
single-family affordable or workforce housing unit may be located
on a lot meeting 75% of the minimum lot area for the single-family
homes in the development.
(9) Density bonus. The Planning Board may permit the number of
dwelling units and bedrooms to exceed the maximum number of
dwelling units and bedrooms otherwise permitted by the Zoning
Code, but in no event by more than 10%, if for every market-rate
dwelling unit in excess of the maximum, one affordable housing
unit is also provided.
(10) Certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy for the
affordable and workforce housing units must be issued at or before
the certificate of occupancy for the market-rate units, except that
for a subdivision development being constructed in phases, the
certificates of occupancy for the required 15% of the affordable and
workforce housing units in each phase must be issued before the
certificates of occupancy for the market-rated units.
§ 295-112.1 TATTOOING § 295-112.1
257:653
B. Administration.
(1) Time period of affordability. Units designated as affordable or
workforce housing units must remain affordable for a minimum of
100 years from the date of the initial certificate of occupancy for
rental properties and from the date of original sale for for-purchase
units.
(2) Primary residence. Any affordable housing unit or workforce
housing unit shall be the primary residence of the resident
household selected to occupy the unit.
(3) No priorities. No preferences shall be utilized to prioritize the
selection of income-eligible tenants or purchasers for affordable or
workforce housing units. This section shall not apply to affordable
housing units created before March 1, 2012.
(4) Maximum sales price/rent.
(a) The maximum gross sale price for an affordable housing unit
shall be based on an annual housing cost, including common
charges, principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, that does not
exceed 33% of 70% of the AMI, adjusted for the median
household size for the unit, as set forth in § 295-112.1A(7).
(b) The maximum monthly rent for a rental affordable housing
unit, plus any tenant-paid utilities, shall not exceed 30% of 60%
of the AMI, adjusted for the median household size for the unit,
as set forth in § 295-112.1A(7).
(c) The maximum gross sale price for a workforce housing unit
shall be based on an annual housing cost, including common
charges, principal, interest, taxes, and insurance, that does not
exceed 33% of 100% of the AMI, adjusted for the median
household size for the unit, as set forth in § 295-112.1A(7).
(d) The maximum monthly rent for a workforce housing unit, plus
any tenant-paid utilities, shall not exceed 30% of 80% of the
AMI, adjusted for the median household size for the unit, as set
forth in § 295-112.1A(7).
(5) Rental units.
(a) A person renting an affordable housing unit or workforce
housing unit shall sign a lease for a term of no more than two
years. As long as a renter remains eligible and has complied
with the terms of the lease, the renter shall be offered renewal
leases for a term of no more than two years each.
(b) Renewal of a lease shall be subject to the conditions of federal,
state or county provisions that may be imposed by the terms of
development funding agreements, if any, or to the provisions of
other applicable local law.
§ 295-112.1 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-112.1
257:654
(c) If no such provisions are applicable and if a renter's annual
gross income should subsequently exceed the maximum then
allowable, as defined in this section, then the renter may
complete his/her current lease term, and shall be offered a
nonrestricted rental unit in the development, if available, at
the end of such lease term. If no such unit is available at said
time, the renter may be allowed to sign one additional one-year
lease for the affordable housing unit s/he occupies but shall not
be offered a renewal of the lease beyond the expiration of that
additional one-year lease term. If, however, the renter's income
falls below the maximum during the additional one-year term,
the renter shall be offered a two-year renewal lease.
(d) Every new or renewal lease must be approved by the Hastingson-
Hudson Affordable Housing Development Fund Co., Inc., to
ensure compliance with the income guidelines and other
requirements of this affordable and workforce housing setaside
section.
(e) The owner of any multifamily building subject to this section
shall annually certify to the satisfaction of the Hastings-on-
Hudson Affordable Housing Development Fund Co., Inc., that
the requisite number of affordable and workforce rental units
have been rented to income-eligible tenants as required by this
section and that any new tenants of the affordable and
workforce units meet the income guidelines in effect when said
new tenants take occupancy. Annual certifications shall include
unit designations and occupant names and shall be signed by
the owner of the building.
(6) Sale of individually owned units.
(a) In the case of owner-occupied affordable or workforce housing
units, the title to such property shall be restricted so that in the
event of any resale by the home buyer or any successor, the
resale price shall not exceed the then-maximum sales price for
said unit, as determined in this section, or the sum of:
[1] The net purchase price (i.e., gross sale price minus any
subsidies) paid for the unit by the owner increased by the
percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index
for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers in the New
York-Northern New Jersey Area, as published by the
United States Bureau of Labor Statistics (the Index) on any
date between the month that was two months earlier than
the date on which the seller acquired the unit and the
month that was two months earlier than the month in
which the seller contracts to sell the unit. If the Bureau
stops publishing this Index, and fails to designate a
successor index, the Village will designate a substitute
index; and [Amended 2-5-2019 by L.L. No. 2-2019]
§ 295-112.1 TATTOOING § 295-112.1
257:655
[2] The cost of major capital improvements made by the seller
of the unit while said seller owned the unit, as evidenced
by paid receipts depreciated on a straight-line basis over a
fifteen-year period from the date of completion; provided,
however, that the improvements were approved by the
Affordable Housing Development Fund Co., Inc.
(b) Notwithstanding Subsection B(6)(a)[1] and [2], in no event
shall the resale price exceed the maximum sales price as
determined by § 295-112.1B(4).
(7) Property restriction. A property containing any affordable or
workforce housing unit must be restricted by using a mechanism
such as a declaration of restrictive covenants, in recordable form
acceptable to the Village Attorney, which shall ensure that the units
shall remain subject to affordable regulations for the minimum onehundred-
year period of affordability. Among other provisions, the
covenants shall require that the unit be the primary residence of
the resident household selected to occupy the unit. Upon approval,
such declaration shall be recorded against the property containing
the affordable or workforce unit prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for any dwelling unit on the property.
(8) The developer and/or owner is responsible for the affirmative
marketing of the affordable and workforce housing units and shall
solicit income-eligible households in accordance with the
requirements, policies and protocols established in the.
Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing Affirmative
Marketing Plan so as to ensure outreach to racially and ethnically
diverse households.
(9) The Village Board of Trustees shall be responsible for the
affordable housing requirements of this affordable and workforce
housing set-aside section and shall have the authority to
promulgate such rules and regulations as may be necessary to
implement them.
(10) The Village Board of Trustees may designate such additional
person(s), authorities and procedures as necessary to monitor
compliance with the provisions of this section.
C. Expedited project review process.
(1) Pre-application meeting. The applicant for a development including
affordable and/or workforce housing units shall be entitled to
attend at least one pre-application meeting at which
representatives will be in attendance from each municipal
department, agency, board, committee and staff expected to play a
role in the review and approval of the development application and
construction. The purpose of this meeting will be to expedite the
application review process through:
§ 295-112.1 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-112.1
257:656
§ 295-113. Application for area variance.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, where a proposed
site plan contains one or more features that do not comply with the zoning
regulations, application may be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals for an
area variance, pursuant to § 295-146 of this chapter, without the necessity
of a decision or determination of an administrative official charged with
enforcement of the zoning regulations.
§ 295-114. Compliance with SEQRA.
In considering any site plan, the Planning Board shall comply with the
provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act127 and its
implementing regulations.
(a) The early identification of issues, concerns, code compliance
and coordination matters that may arise during the review and
approval process.
(b) The establishment of a comprehensive review process outline,
proposed meeting schedule and conceptual timeline.

to same. Should the approval process extend beyond one year, an
application for a development including affordable and/or
workforce housing units shall be entitled to at least one additional
meeting per year with the same departments, agencies, boards,
committees, and staff to review any and all items discussed at
previous pre-application meetings.

§ 295-117. Statement of policy.
It is declared to be the policy of the Village to consider land subdivisions
as part of a plan for the orderly, efficient and economical development of
the Village. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that it can
be used safely for building or development purposes without danger to
health or peril from fire, flood or other menace, and without resulting in
significant damage to the ecology of the area in which it is located. Proper
provision shall be made for drainage, water, sewerage, electric, telephone,
gas and other needed improvements. The proposed streets shall compose
a convenient system conforming to the Zoning Map128 of the Village of
Hastings-on-Hudson. Streets shall be of such width, grade and location
as to accommodate the prospective traffic, to afford adequate light and
air and to facilitate fire and police protection. In proper cases, and when
required by the Planning Board, a park or parks of suitable location, size
and character for playground or other recreational purposes shall be shown
on the subdivision plat.
§ 295-118. Issuance of building permits.
No permit shall be issued for the erection of any building within a proposed
subdivision until said subdivision has been duly approved by the Planning
Board and filed in the office of the County Clerk, except that the Building
Inspector may issue a building permit for a single building based upon the
entire tract of land where there is no other existing building within the
proposed subdivision and where the proposed building is in accordance
with an approved preliminary plat.

and surety has been filed and after all other required conditions of
the resolution of approval, including the payment of all fees, have
been complied with. Said endorsement shall be by signature and

Planning Board, the Board of Trustees may thereupon declare said
bond to be in default and collect the sum remaining payable thereunder
and, upon receipt of the proceeds thereof, the Village shall install such
improvements as are covered by the bond or security and are

§ 295-123. Modification of bond or security.
§ 295-124. Modification of requirements.
If at any time, either before or during the course of construction of the
required improvements, it is determined by the Planning Board that
unforeseen conditions make it necessary to modify the location or design of
any improvements, the Planning Board may modify the terms and conditions
of the approval so as to require such changes as may be necessary to comply
with the spirit and intent of the Planning Board's original approval and
to conform to accepted engineering practices. If such modification affects
the scope of work covered by a bond or security, the Planning Board may
require or allow appropriate modification of such bond or security.
§ 295-125. Inspection of improvements.
The Superintendent of Public Works or his or her designee shall be
responsible for inspecting required improvements during construction to
ensure their satisfactory completion and, upon such completion, shall
furnish the Planning Board with a statement to that effect. If the
Superintendent of Public Works determines that any of the required
improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the approved
plan, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing said
improvements. Failure of the Superintendent of Public Works to carry out
inspections of required improvements during construction shall not in any
place in the subdivision but not exceeding, in cost, the amount of such
proceeds.
A. Extension of period specified in bond or security. The time period
specified for the completion of all required improvements, as set forth
in the bond or security, may be extended only by resolution of the
Planning Board upon request by the applicant setting forth, in detail,
the amount of work that has been completed, reasons for failure to
complete the remainder of the work within the specified period, the
maximum estimated time required to complete the remainder of the
work and the time-period extension that is requested.
B. Reduction of bond or security. An applicant may request, in writing, that
the Planning Board authorize a reduction in the amount of the bond or
security. Such request shall itemize the extent of required
improvements already completed, the estimated cost of improvements
remaining to be completed and the amount of bond reduction
requested. Then, upon approval of the Board of Trustees and after due
notice and public hearing, the Planning Board may, if it determines that
sufficient required improvements have been installed to warrant such
action, reduce the face amount of the bond or security by an
appropriate amount so that the new amount will cover the cost in full of
all required improvements remaining to be completed, and any security
deposited with the bond may be reduced proportionately.

(e) After completion of all improvements.
(2) The applicant shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to
the first stage until the work of the previous stage has been
inspected and approved by the Superintendent of Public Works or
his or her designee. In the case of any other improvements, the
Superintendent of Public Works or his or her designee shall inspect
the work at such progressive stages as (s)he shall specify, and shall
certify to the Planning Board that the work was inspected by him or
her and was in accordance with the approved plans and
specifications.
B. Certificate of construction. At such time as the applicant has completed
construction of all required improvements, the applicant shall furnish

culverts, headwalls, drains, manholes, catch basins, sidewalks, curbs,
utility lines and equipment, monuments, street signs, street trees and
all other required improvements, as constructed, and all other
pertinent information, such as cross-sections of the streets at intervals
determined by the Superintendent of Public Works, the culvert and
drain grades, sewer grades, sidewalk and curb grades and invert
elevations at manholes. Such plans and profiles shall bear a dated
certification by a professional engineer or licensed surveyor to the
effect that the data shown thereon was accurately determined by field
survey. If the location or accuracy of improvements does not, in the
opinion of the Planning Board, fully comply with the approved
construction plans and specifications, the Planning Board shall have the
right to refuse to sign the final plat or release the bond until such
situation is corrected.
C. Inspection fee. To offset the costs incurred by the Village in conducting
inspections, all applicants for approval of submissions involving the
§ 295-125 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-125
257:672
§ 295-126. Future status of streets, parks and easements.
§ 295-127. Waiver of required improvements.
The Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, the
provision of any or all such improvements and requirements as, in its
judgment of the special circumstances of a particular plat, are not requisite
in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare or which, in
its judgment, are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities adjacent or in proximity to the subdivision.
construction of streets and/or other improvements shall be required to
submit an inspection fee, payable to the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson,
in an amount to be determined by the Village Board by resolution and
set in the fee schedule.135 [Amended 9-21-1999 by L.L. No. 4-1999]
A. Offers of cession. All streets, parks and easements shall be indicated on
the plat. In accordance with § 7-732 of the Village Law, the applicant
may add as part of the plat a notation, if the applicant so desires, to the
effect that no offer of dedication of such streets or parks, or any of
them, is made to the public. All offers of cession to the public of all
streets and parks not so marked shall be filed with the Planning Board
at the time of submission of the final application.
B. Petition for dedication. Upon completion of the subdivision and the
road(s), a petition in the form required by the Board of Trustees shall be
filed with such Board for the acceptance of parks or any other
reservations or easements.
C. Acceptance by Village. Acceptance of any offer of cession of streets or
parks shall rest with the Board of Trustees. In the event that the
applicant shall elect not to file the plat in the office of the County Clerk
within the period prescribed for such filing, then such formal offer of
cession shall be deemed void. The approval by the Planning Board of a
subdivision plat shall not be deemed to constitute nor imply the
acceptance by the Village of any streets, parks or other areas shown on
said plat and the Planning Board may require the addition of
appropriate notes to this effect on the plat.
D. Maintenance. In the event that no offer of cession to the public is made
for the streets, parks and required easements shown on the plat, there
shall be submitted with the final application copies of agreements or
other documents providing for the suitable maintenance of such
facilities and a statement of all rights that exist with respect to each of
them. The adequacy of such documents shall be subject to Planning
Board approval.

§ 295-125 TATTOOING § 295-128
257:673
§ 295-128. Certificates of occupancy for structures fronting on
bonded streets.
A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for a structure within a
subdivision where the improvements are guaranteed by a performance
bond or other security unless it is determined by the Planning Board that
both of the following conditions have been complied with:
§ 295-129. General requirements for subdivision design.
The Planning Board, in considering an application for the subdivision of
land, shall be guided by the following considerations and standards, which
standards shall be deemed to be the minimum requirements for the
convenience, health, safety and welfare of the Village:
A. Status of street improvements. The improvement of the street or streets
giving access to the structure has progressed to a stage deemed
adequate by the Planning Board to render safe all-weather vehicular
access for both routine and emergency purposes.
B. Maintenance agreements. Written agreements have been filed
providing for the maintenance of the bonded street or streets in such
all-weather passable condition, including snow removal and sanding,
during the period between the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
and the acceptance of the fully completed street by the Board of
Trustees. (NOTE: If the street is not to be offered for dedication to the
Village, such an agreement will have been required in accordance with
§ 295-126D of these subdivision regulations.)
A. Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character that
it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood, drainage or other menace to neighboring
properties or the public health, safety and welfare. Land subject to such
hazards shall not be subdivided nor developed for residential purposes,
nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or
property, or aggravate a flood hazard, but such land may be set aside
for uses as shall not involve such danger nor produce unsatisfactory
living conditions.
B. Preservation of natural features.
(1) Land to be subdivided shall be designated in reasonable conformity
to existing topography in order to minimize grading, cut and fill,
and to retain, insofar as possible, the natural contours, to limit
stormwater runoff and to conserve the natural vegetative cover and
soil. No tree, topsoil or excavated material shall be removed from
its natural position except where necessary and incidental to the
improvement of lots and the construction of streets and related
facilities in accordance with the approved plan. Topsoil shall be
restored to a depth of at least six inches and properly seeded and
§ 295-128 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-129
257:674
§ 295-130. Location and design of streets.
fertilized in those disturbed areas not occupied by buildings or
structures.
(2) Existing natural features that are of ecological, aesthetic or scenic
value to residential development or to the Village as a whole, such
as wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, rock formations, stands
of trees, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, shall be
preserved, insofar as possible, through harmonious design of the
subdivision and, where appropriate, the Planning Board may
require the inclusion of such features in permanent reservations.
C. Conformity to Village Zoning Map.136 Streets, parks and other
subdivision features shall conform to the Village Zoning Map.
D. Frontage on improved streets. The area proposed to be subdivided shall
have frontage on and direct access to a street duly placed on the Zoning
Map, and if such street be private, it shall be improved to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board or there shall be a bond held by the
Village to guarantee such improvement.
A. Location, width and improvements. Streets shall be suitably located, of
sufficient width and suitable grade and adequately improved to
accommodate the expected traffic and to afford satisfactory access to
police, fire-fighting, snow removal and other utility and road
maintenance equipment, and shall be coordinated so as to compose a
safe and convenient system.
B. Relation to topography. Streets shall be appropriately related to the
natural topography and shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. A
combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
C. Intersections. Cross (four-cornered) street intersections shall be
avoided insofar as possible, except at important traffic locations. A
distance at least equal to the minimum required lot width, but not less
than 150 feet, shall be maintained between center lines of offset
intersecting streets. Within 60 feet of the center of an intersection,
streets shall be at approximately right angles and grades shall be
limited to 1.5%. When two streets intersect at an angle of less than 75°,
special pavement, channelization, right-of-way and/or sight easement
restrictions may be required by the Planning Board.
D. Continuation of streets into adjacent properties.
(1) The arrangement of streets shall provide for their construction
between adjacent properties where such continuation is
determined necessary for proper traffic movement, effective fire
protection, efficient provision of utilities, snow removal and other
136. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Village offices.
§ 295-129 TATTOOING § 295-130
257:675
services. Alternatively, if a street continuation is not determined
to be warranted by the circumstances, or would result in unsafe
traffic conditions or otherwise jeopardize the public safety and
welfare, the Planning Board may require such street to be
terminated short of the boundary lines of the subdivision.
(2) Where a continuation of a street beyond the boundaries of a
subdivision is warranted but the adjacent property is undeveloped
and the street must dead-end temporarily, the Planning Board may
require that the right-of-way and all improvements be extended to
the property line. A temporary circular turnaround shall be
provided on all temporary dead-end streets in excess of 100 feet in
length, with a notation on the plat that land outside the normal
street right-of-way shall revert to abutting property owners upon
continuation of the street. The length of temporary dead-end
streets shall normally be limited to not more than double the
permitted length of permanent dead-end streets.
(3) Where a turnaround exists at the end of a street within an adjoining
development to which a proposed street is to connect, the applicant
may be required to remove the portions of the turnaround
pavement outside of the normal width of the traveled way, perform
any necessary reconstruction of the pavement edge, construct
continuations of any existing driveways to the new pavement edge
and regrade, seed and drain the disturbed areas in such a manner
as to blend them in with the surrounding landscape.
E. Permanent dead-end streets.
(1) Where a street does not extend to the boundary of a subdivision
and its future continuation is not required by the Planning Board, it
shall be separated from such boundary by a distance not less than
the minimum required lot depth. The Planning Board may require
the reservation of an easement to the boundary to accommodate
utilities, drainage facilities and/or pedestrian traffic. A circular
turnaround shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end
street.
(2) For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, permanent dead-end streets shall, in general, be limited
in length, exclusive of the turnaround, to eight times the minimum
lot width for the zoning district in which it is located.
F. Solar access considerations. To permit maximum solar access to
proposed lots and future buildings, wherever reasonably feasible,
consistent with other appropriate design considerations, new streets
shall be located on an east-west access. This encourages house siting
with the maximum exposure of roof and wall area to the sun. The
Planning Board shall also consider the slope of the property and the
nature and location of existing vegetation as they affect solar access.
§ 295-130 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-130
257:676
G. Street names. Street names shall be sufficiently different in sound and
in spelling from other names in the Village so as not to cause confusion.
A street that is a continuation of an existing street shall bear the same
name. In general, street names shall conform to the following
classifications:
(1) Avenue, Street or Road: major or collector street.
(2) Drive or Lane: minor residential streets, except as follows:
(a) Court or Place: permanent dead-end street.
(b) Circle or Loop: street that returns to a starting point, or a
street both ends of which intersect another street at different
locations.
H. Design standards for new streets. Streets shall meet the design
standards set forth in the following table. Street classifications may be
determined by the Planning Board. Standards are not shown for streets
that would be built by the state or county.

A. Street improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with
pavement, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, street lighting standards, street
§ 295-130 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-131
257:678
signs, street trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, fire
alarm signal devices, fire hydrants and other utilities, except that the
Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, such
improvements as it considers are not requisite in the interest of the
public health, safety and welfare. The subdivider shall install
underground service connections to the property line of each lot before
the street is paved. Except where waivers are granted, all such grading
and street improvements shall conform in all respects to these
subdivision regulations and to the Village construction standards and
specifications.
B. Drainage improvements.
(1) The subdivider may be required by the Planning Board to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may
exist either previous to or as a result of the subdivision. Such
drainage facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way, where
feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate
width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the Village
construction standards and specifications.
(2) Drainage facilities shall, in each case, be large enough to
accommodate potential runoff from their entire upstream drainage
area, whether inside or outside the subdivision, based on a onehundred-
year storm and assuming conditions of maximum potential
development within the watershed as permitted by this chapter.
The applicant shall be responsible for submitting such
computations to the Superintendent of Public Works in sufficient
detail to make possible the ready determination of the adequacy of
the proposed drainage installations and the Superintendent of
Public Works shall be responsible for reviewing these and
preparing recommendations for the Planning Board.
(3) The Planning Board may also require the subdivider to prepare a
study of the effects of the subdivision on existing downstream
drainage facilities. Where such study or the Planning Board, after
an independent analysis, determines that the additional runoff
incident to the development of the subdivision will overload an
existing downstream drainage facility, the Planning Board shall
notify the owner of such downstream facility of such potential
condition and may withhold approval of the subdivision until
provision has been made for the correction of said potential
condition.
C. Underground utilities. In order to assure greater safety and improved
appearance, all utility lines and related equipment for providing power
and communication services shall be installed underground in the
manner prescribed by the regulations of the utility company having
jurisdiction. Underground utility lines shall be located outside of the
traveled way of the streets but, except in unusual circumstances, within
the street right-of-way. Underground service connections shall be
§ 295-131 TATTOOING § 295-131
257:679
provided to the property line of each lot before the street is paved and
may pass under the traveled way of the street.
D. Other improvements.
(1) Monuments.
(a) Monuments shall be required wherever deemed necessary by
the Planning Board to enable all property lines to be readily
reproduced on the ground. In general, monuments shall be
located no more than 500 feet apart on street lines, preferably
at street, lot or easement corners or at points of curvature or
tangency on curved streets, and spaced to be within sight of
one another along lines entirely within the street right-of-way.
(b) Monuments shall be set vertically in solid ground three inches
above the ground surface with accurate reference to a
permanently identifiable fixed point, and shall meet or exceed
the construction requirements specified in the Village
construction standards and specifications.
(2) Traffic control and street signs. Traffic control and street signs
shall be provided by the subdivider and placed at all intersections,
within the street right-of-way, and in other locations as required by
the approving authority. In the case of traffic control signs, their
type and location shall be approved by the Chief of Police of the
Village of Hastings-on-Hudson and, in the case of street signs, by
the Superintendent of Public Works of the Village of Hastings-on-
Hudson.
(3) Street lighting standards. When required by the Planning Board,
street lighting standards, of a design and location specified in the
Village construction standards and specifications, shall be provided
and installed by the subdivider.
(4) Sanitary sewers and sewerage facilities, water mains and water
supply facilities and fire hydrants. Where required by the Planning
Board, the subdivider shall install sanitary sewers and sewerage
facilities and/or water mains and water supply facilities and fire
hydrants of the type and in a manner specified in the Village
construction standards and specifications.
(5) Fire alarm signal devices. Where required by the Planning Board,
the subdivider shall install fire alarm signal devices, including
necessary ducts, cables and other connecting facilities, of a type
and in a manner and location prescribed by the appropriate fire
district or other municipal agency having jurisdiction.
(6) Street trees. The Planning Board may require the planting of street
trees. Such trees shall be of a hardwood variety indigenous to the
neighborhood, and shall be at least five inches' caliper at a height
of five feet above ground level. Where they are required by the
§ 295-131 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-131
257:680
§ 295-132. Lot specifications.
Planning Board, such trees shall be planted along both sides of the
street, within the street right-of-way and spaced approximately 40
feet on center.
(7) School bus pickup areas. The Planning Board may require that the
subdivider reserve, clear, grade, pave and otherwise improve an
area of such size and location as will provide a safe and suitable
place for the use of children awaiting school buses. In general, the
size of such area shall not be less than 100 square feet, and no
dimensions shall be less than eight feet. Such area shall be
included within the street right-of-way and shall be maintained by
the holder of fee title to the street. The layout and design shall be
subject to Planning Board approval.
A. Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that there will be
no foreseeable difficulty, for reasons of topography or other conditions,
in securing building permits to build on all lots in compliance with this
chapter, the Wetlands Law and the County Health Department
regulations.
B. Driveways. Approximate driveway locations shall be shown on the
construction plans. The maximum driveway gradient to the building site
shall not exceed the limits contained in § 295-40 of this chapter, and the
intersection of driveways with the road shall be so oriented and graded
that vehicles may use the driveways safely. The Planning Board may
require that the applicant submit necessary topographic and design
information to demonstrate that the lot layout will allow driveways that
meet these criteria and provide proper drainage.
C. Lot dimensions.
(1) Except as provided elsewhere in these subdivision regulations or
otherwise permitted by the Board of Trustees, lot area and
dimensions shall comply with at least the minimum standards of
this chapter for the district in which they are located. Where lots
are more than double the minimum required area, the Planning
Board may require that they be arranged so as to allow for further
subdivision and the opening of future streets where necessary to
serve such potential lots, all in compliance with this chapter and
these subdivision regulations. Where, in the opinion of the Planning
Board, lots of larger than minimum size are required for purposes
of proper drainage, water supply, waste disposal or the
preservation of important ecological features, the Planning Board
may require such oversized lots as a condition of plat approval.
(2) Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to street lines (or
radial to curving street lines) unless the Planning Board allows a
variation from this rule to give a better street or lot arrangement.
Dimensions of corner lots shall be large enough to allow for
§ 295-131 TATTOOING § 295-132
257:681
erection of buildings observing the minimum front yard setback
from both streets.
(3) Where a proposed subdivision includes an existing residence larger
in size than can appropriately be placed on a lot of the minimum
size permitted in the zoning district, the Planning Board may
require that the lot be of such size and relationship to the proposed
street system that the structure will be an appropriate and
harmonious part of the subdivision.
D. Access from collector streets. Lots shall not, in general, derive access
from a collector street, but shall front on a minor interior street. When
driveway access from a collector street may be necessary for two or
more adjoining lots, the Planning Board may require that such lots be
served by a combined access drive in order to limit the possible traffic
hazard on such street. Any such driveways, where permitted, shall be
designed in such a way as to provide adequate and convenient area for
the turnaround of vehicles so as to avoid requiring them to back into
traffic on such streets.
E. Double frontage lots. Lots fronting on two streets, other than corner
lots, shall be avoided except where deemed essential by the Planning
Board in order to provide separation of residential development from
major or collector streets, or to overcome problems of topography or
orientation. The Planning Board may require access limitations and/or
buffer landscaping for such double frontage lots where the Planning
Board determines that such measures would be appropriate.
F. Water bodies. If a subdivision contains a water body or portion thereof,
lot lines shall be drawn so as to distribute the entire ownership of the
water body among the fees of the adjacent lots, unless the Planning
Board approves an alternate plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for the safety of the water body is so placed that it will not
become a Village responsibility. No more than 25% of the minimum lot
area required under this chapter may be satisfied by land which is
under water or is defined as a wetland.
G. Access across a watercourse. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street by which it has access, provision
shall be made for the installation of a bridge, culvert or other draining
facility, of a design approved by the Planning Board based upon, among
other considerations, recommendation of the Superintendent of Public
Works, to provide satisfactory access across such watercourse for fire,
police or other emergency equipment.
H. Subdivision with land in two or more zoning districts or municipalities.
(1) In general, a lot should not be divided by a zoning district or
municipal boundary. If it is, however, necessary for a zoning district
boundary to cross a lot, such lot shall be designed so that it can be
readily developed in accordance with the standards of the more
restrictive zoning district. If it is necessary for a municipal
§ 295-132 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-132
257:682
§ 295-133. Reservations and easements.
All reservations and easements shall be clearly indicated on the final
subdivision plat, along with appropriate notations indicating the rights
which exist with respect to each such reservation and/or easement.
boundary line to cross a lot, the Planning Board may require
suitable legal agreements to assure that the two portions of the lot
will not be separated in the future and that the portion of the lot
in the adjoining municipality will not be used for any purpose that
would make it nonconforming if the entire lot were located within
the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson.
(2) Whenever a subdivision includes land in two or more zoning
districts and/or municipalities, the location of the zoning district
and/or municipal boundary lines shall be shown on the plat and, in
addition, where zoning boundaries are involved, the following
notation shall be added: "Existing zoning boundaries as of
________________, ____."
A. Park reservations.
(1) General standards.
(a) The Planning Board may require that land be reserved within
subdivisions containing residential units for a park or parks
suitably located for playground or other recreational purposes.
Such locations shall be as designated on the Zoning Map,137 or
as otherwise deemed appropriate by the Planning Board. Each
reservation shall be of suitable size, dimensions, topography
and general character and shall have adequate street access
for the particular purpose or purposes envisioned by the
Planning Board. The area shall be shown and marked on the
plat as "Reserved for Park Purposes."
(b) Before the Planning Board may require that land be reserved
for park, playground or other recreational purposes, the
Planning Board must make a finding that such requirement is
warranted. Such a finding shall include an evaluation of the
present and anticipated future needs for park and recreational
facilities in the Village, based on the projected population
growth to which the particular subdivision plat will contribute.
(2) Minimum size.
(a) Areas for parks should be of reasonable size for neighborhood
playgrounds or other recreational uses. In general, not less
than 10% of the area of the subdivision shall be set aside for
these purposes.
137. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the Village offices.
§ 295-132 TATTOOING § 295-133
257:683
(b) In general, sites reserved for park purposes shall have an area
of at least one acre. The Planning Board may require the
location of such areas along the boundary of a subdivision so
that additional land may be added at such time as the adjacent
property is subdivided.
(3) Ownership of park area. The ownership of reservations for park
purposes shall be clearly indicated on the plat and established in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board so as to assure their
proper future continuation and maintenance.
(4) Cash payment in lieu of reservation.
(a) Where the Planning Board determines that a suitable park or
parks of adequate size cannot be properly located in a
subdivision, or where such a reservation is otherwise not
appropriate or practical, the Planning Board may require, as a
condition to approval of any such plat, a payment to the Village
of a sum determined for such cases by the Board of Trustees.
(b) In making the determination of suitability, the Planning Board
shall assess the size and suitability of land shown on the
subdivision plat which could be possible locations for park or
recreational facilities, as well as practical factors, including
whether there is a need for additional facilities in the
immediate neighborhood.
(c) Any moneys required by the Planning Board in lieu of land for
park, playground or other recreational purposes pursuant to
this section shall be deposited into a trust fund to be used by
the Village exclusively for park, playground or other
recreational purposes, including the acquisition of property.
(5) This Subsection A shall not apply to lots set aside for affordable
housing units or workforce housing units, as defined in this
chapter. [Added 1-8-2013 by L.L. No. 1-2013]
B. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing street that is narrower than the recommended
right-of-way width as specified for such streets in these subdivision
regulations, or where a subdivision borders an existing street planned
for widening or realignment in such a way as to require the use of some
land in the subdivision, the Planning Board may require the subdivision
plat to show such areas that shall be marked "Reserved for Street
Realignment (or Widening) Purposes." Land reserved for such purposes
may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of this
chapter.
C. Utility and draining easements.
(1) Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage facilities within
§ 295-133 HASTINGS-ON-HUDSON CODE § 295-133
257:684
street rights-of-way, perpetual unobstructed easements of at least
15 feet in width shall be provided for such utilities or drainage
facilities across properties outside the street lines and with
satisfactory access to the street. Drainage easements shall extend
from the street to the watercourse or other drainage facility, and
shall convey to the holder of fee title of the street the perpetual
right to discharge stormwater runoff from the street and the
surrounding area onto and over the affected premises by means of
pipes, culverts or ditches, or a combination thereof, together with
the right to enter said premises for the purpose of making such
installations and doing such maintenance work as the holder of
such fee title may deem necessary to adequately drain the street
and the surrounding area.
(2) When a proposed drainage system will carry water across private
land outside the subdivision, appropriate drainage rights must be
secured in a form satisfactory to the Village Attorney and suitable
for recording in the office of the County Clerk.
D. Slope easements. Where determined appropriate by the Planning
Board, the Planning Board may permit an embankment alongside a
proposed street to extend beyond the normal right-of-way of such
street, provided that a slope easement is granted, conveying to the
holder of fee title of the street the right to enter the premises for the
purpose of maintaining such slope. Where the embankment slope is
located on private land outside the subdivision, such easement shall be
permitted only where the appropriate rights have been secured in a
form satisfactory to the Village Attorney and suitable for recording in
the office of the County Clerk.
E. Sight easements. Sight easements shall be provided across all street
corners, outside the street right-of-way, within the triangular area
formed by the nearest edges of street pavement and a straight line
between two points each 75 feet back from the theoretical intersection
of the edges of such pavement prolonged. The easements shall provide
that the holder of fee title to the abutting streets shall have the right to
enter the easement area for the purpose of clearing, pruning or
regrading so as to maintain a clear line of sight in either direction
across such triangular area between an observer's eye 3 1/2 feet above
the pavement surface on one street and an object one foot above the
pavement surface on the other. The initial establishment of clear sight
lines within the sight easement area shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider.
F. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Board may require, in

regulations so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest
secured; provided, however, that any such modification will be consistent

and the Zoning Map of the Village of Hastings-on-Hudson.138 In permitting
any such modification, the Planning Board shall attach such conditions as
are, in its judgment, necessary to secure substantially the objectives of the
standard or requirement so modified.
§ 295-136. Application for area variance.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, where a plat contains
one or more lots that do not comply with the zoning regulations, application
may be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals for an area variance pursuant
to § 295-146 of this chapter, without the necessity of a decision or
determination of an administrative official charged with the enforcement of
the zoning regulations. Where such an application is made to the Zoning
Board of Appeals, the Planning Board shall provide the Zoning Board with a
written recommendation concerning the proposed variance.
A. Any subdivision creating eight or more lots that is not also undergoing
site plan review shall require the set-aside of at least 15% of the lots for
the development of affordable housing units or workforce housing
units, as defined in § 295-5. At least 2/3 of such lots shall be set aside for
development as affordable housing units. The remaining 1/3 of such lots
shall be set aside for development as either affordable housing units or
workforce housing units. All such affordable and workforce housing
units shall be subject to the provisions of § 295-112.1 of this chapter.
B. The Planning Board shall include in the resolution granting subdivision
approval conditions to insure that construction of the affordable and/or
workforce housing units will be substantially completed before
certificates of occupancy are granted for houses on at least 20% of the
unrestricted lots.

allowed or is prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.
(2) No use variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals without a
showing by the applicant that applicable zoning regulations and
restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In order to prove
such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall demonstrate to the
Board of Appeals that for each and every permitted use under the
zoning regulations for the particular district where the property is
located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and

257:694
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of a use variance, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to
address the unnecessary hardship proved by the applicant, and at
the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
C. Area variances.
(1) "Area variance" shall mean the authorization by the Board of
Appeals for the use of land in a manner that is not allowed by the
dimensional or physical requirements of the applicable zoning
regulations.
(2) In determining whether to grant an area variance, the Board of
Appeals shall take into consideration the benefit to the applicant if
the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by
such grant. In making such determination, the Board of Appeals
shall also consider:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance.
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other
than an area variance.
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial.
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district.
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the Board of Appeals but
shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the area
variance.
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of an area variance, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the character
of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the
community.
D. Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of
both use variances and area variances, have the authority to impose
such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to
and incidental to the proposed use of the property. Such conditions
shall be consistent with the spirit and intent of this chapter, and shall be
imposed for the purpose of minimizing any adverse impact such
variance may have on the neighborhood or community.

257:695
§ 295-147. Expiration of variances; application of provisions
governing nonconformity.
A. Variances granted pursuant to this chapter and which cannot fully be
exercised without a building permit shall automatically lapse and
become null and void if a building permit issued in accordance with the
variance is not obtained within 12 months after it has been granted. If a
building permit is obtained, the variance shall automatically lapse and
become null and void:
(1) To the extent it is not fully exercised within six months after the

or
(2) Upon the expiration, lapse, revocation or termination of the
building permit.

(2) Upon the expiration, lapse, revocation or termination of the

within six months after it has been granted.

can be fully exercised without a building permit shall automatically
lapse and become null and void to the extent the variance is not fully
exercised within six months after the effective date of this chapter.

lawfully nonconforming lots, structures, buildings and uses, including,
without limitation, the provisions of this chapter relating to the
abandonment of nonconforming lots, structures, buildings and uses.

notice of the hearing to all persons who, according to the latest
completed assessment roll of the Village, own property within
a radius of 300 feet of the property lines of the subject
property; provided, however, that where, in the opinion of the
Building Inspector, the amendment or change may affect
property located more than 300 feet from the property lines of
the subject property, the applicants or petitioners shall thus
notify all owners of property within that affected area, as

(c) The public hearing shall not be held unless the applicants or
petitioners have filed with the Board of Trustees either the

however, that the Board of Trustees may excuse the failure to
notify any property owner pursuant to this Subsection D(3)
upon proof by the applicants or petitioners of diligent efforts to
comply with the requirements of this Subsection D(3) and upon
a showing that reasonable grounds exist for that failure to
comply, including, without limitation, difficulties in
determining lot lines or the names or addresses of the property
owners.
(d) No hearing or action by the Board of Trustees shall be held to
be invalid or illegal because of the failure of any person or any

exist from time to time.
[2] Whether and how the proposed amendment or other
change is consistent, or inconsistent, with the aims and
principles embodied in this chapter as to the particular
district or districts concerned and set forth in §§ 295-2 and
295-3 above.
[3] Which areas and establishments of the Village will be

its effect on other laws and regulations.
(b) With respect to amendments or changes in the Zoning Map:
[1] Whether and how the proposed amendment or other
change is consistent, or inconsistent, with the
comprehensive plan of the Village, as it may exist from
time to time.
[2] Whether the uses permitted by the proposed amendment
or other change would be appropriate in the area
concerned.
[3] Whether adequate public schools or other facilities and
services exist or can be created to serve the needs of any
additional development likely to be constructed as a result
of the amendment or change.
§ 295-157 TATTOOING § 295-157
257:703
(3) In making its report on any proposed amendment, the Board of
Appeals shall state its views as to the desirability and practicability

power of the Board of Trustees to act on the proposed amendment
or other change.
F. Disapproval by County Planning Board. If the County Planning Board, in
appearing before the Board of Trustees at the public hearing,
disapproves of the proposed amendment or other change, or

land immediately adjacent thereto, extending 100 feet therefrom, or by
the owners of 20% or more of the land directly opposite thereto,
extending 100 feet from the street frontage of that opposite land, the
