TUCUMCARI, NEW MEXICO - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Tucumcari, New Mexico 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Tucumcari, New Mexico Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1999, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Jeannette Maddaford, city clerk. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1131, passed December 3, 2015.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As of Supplement No. 18, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

It is the public policy of the city to: (1) make whole the victim of the crime to the extent possible; and (2) to remind the defendant of his or her wrongdoing and require him or her to repay the costs society has incurred as a result of his or her misconduct. This section shall be interpreted and administered to effectuate this policy. As used in this section unless the context otherwise requires: 
a.	"Victim" means any person or the city which represents its citizens, who has suffered actual damages as a result of the defendant's criminal activities. 
b.	"Actual damages" means all damages which a victim could recover against the defendant in a civil action arising out of the same facts or event, except punitive damages and damages for pain, suffering, mental anguish and loss of consortium. Without limitation, actual damages includes damages for the costs of incarceration including but not limited to the costs of medical care. 
c.	"Criminal activities" includes any crime for which there is a plea of guilty or verdict of guilty, upon which a judgment may be rendered and any other crime committed after August 1, 1994 which is admitted or not contested by the defendant. 
d.	"Restitution" means full or partial payment of actual damages to a victim or the city.
2.	If the municipal court exercises its sentencing options, the court may require as a condition of release or probation that the defendant, in cooperation with the court, promptly prepare a plan of restitution, including a specific amount of restitution to each victim and a schedule of restitution payments. If the defendant is presently unable to make any restitution but there is a reasonable possibility that the defendant may be able to do so at some time during his or her probation period, the plan of restitution shall also state the conditions under which or the event after which the defendant will make restitution. If the defendant believes that he or she will not be able to make any restitution, he or she shall so state and shall specify the reasons. If the defendant believes that no person suffered actual damages as a result of the defendant's activities, he or she shall so state. 
3.	The defendant's plan of restitution shall be submitted promptly to the court. The court shall promptly enter an order approving, disapproving or modifying the plan, taking into account the factors enumerated in subsection (A)(4) of this section. Compliance with the plan of restitution as approved by the court shall be a condition of the defendant's release or probation. Restitution payments shall be made to the city clerk unless otherwise directed by the court. The court thereafter may modify the plan at any time upon the defendant's request or upon the court's own motion. 
4.	The court when determining or reviewing the defendant's plan of restitution shall consider the physical and mental health and condition of the defendant his or her age, his or her education, his or her employment circumstances, his or her potential for employment and vocational training, his or her family circumstances, his or her financial condition, the number of victims, the actual damages of each victim, what plan of restitution will most effectively aid the rehabilitation of the defendant and such other factors as shall be appropriate. 
5.	The clerk of the court shall mail to each known victim a copy of the court's order approving or modifying the plan of restitution. 
6.	Failure of the defendant to comply with subsection (A)(2) of this section or to comply with the plan of restitution as approved may constitute violation of the conditions of release or probation. 
7.	This section and proceedings under this section shall not limit or impair the rights of victims to recover damages from the defendant in a civil action. However, any restitution payment by the defendant to a victim shall be set off against any judgment in favor of the victim in a civil action arising out of the same facts or event. 
B.	Disposition and Use of Fees Collected. All restitution collected shall be deposited in a special restitution fund in the municipal treasury and shall be used only for the payment of costs expended on behalf of the city or victim. 
C.	Lien and Foreclosure. The reasonable costs to the city in the direct and indirect enforcement of the law against the defendant shall constitute a lien against the real property owned by the defendant. The lien may be foreclosed in the manner provided in Sections 3-36-1 through 3-36-6 NMSA 1978. 
(Ord. 889 §§ 1-3, 1994)
1.12.080 - Incarceration.

(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.050 - Hiring: Temporary and casual employment. 
    In order to have the necessary flexibility in staffing to meet department demands, seasonal or cyclical fluctuations in workload, to temporarily replace employees absent due to termination or extended leave, or to complete special short-term projects, the city manager may hire an employee through a non-competitive selection process for a temporary or a "casual" job assignment. (See also: Section 2.64.090 Employment classifications.) 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)

2.64.070 - Pre-employment screening. 
    The city of Tucumcari is committed to a policy of hiring the best qualified available candidate to fill vacant city staff positions. To accomplish that goal, once the best qualified candidates for a position have been identified, the city will conduct pre-employment screening of those candidates in accordance with the procedure described below. 
    All applicants selected for hire shall complete a pre-existing condition form pursuant to the worker's compensation statutes, NMSA 1978, § 52-1-1 et seq. 
    The human resource department will conduct a pre-employment screening on every candidate prior to an offer of employment. The nature of pre-employment screening performed will vary depending on the requirements of the position being filled; certain positions have more stringent requirements than others. Uncertified or certified by waiver candidates for law enforcement positions will be required to successfully pass a physical agility test prior to employment. Every candidate selected for hire is required to pass a pre-employment drug test prior to employment (See: Drug and alcohol-free workplace section). The cost of pre-employment screening will be paid by the department that seeks to employ the applicant. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.080 - Probationary period. 
    Every newly hired employee will serve a probationary period. The purpose of the probationary period is to give the supervisor the opportunity to evaluate the employee's suitability, potential and performance in the position and to provide the employee the opportunity to decide if he or she is satisfied with the position. 
    The probationary period for employees, except those hired as non-certified police officers, is the first one hundred eighty (180) calendar days of continuous employment. During this time, all employees are on an introductory status, are terminable at will, and do not have access to the grievance resolution procedure. With the approval of the city manager, the probationary period for an individual employee may be extended for up to an additional ninety (90) calendar days. 
    Employees cannot avail themselves of the grievance resolution procedure set forth herein with relation to discipline or termination while serving the probationary period. 
    The probationary period for an employee hired as a non-certified police officer recruit will be extended as necessary to include the employee's training at the law enforcement academy. A recruit who fails to earn certification at the completion of training within the one-year period required under New Mexico law will be released from employment for failure to successfully complete the probationary period. A recruit who successfully completes his or her training at the academy and attains certification will serve an additional 180-day probationary period beginning on the date of certification. A recruit may be terminated from employment for any reason while serving the probationary period. 
    Any break in service or position transfer within the city shall require completion of a new probationary period upon rehire. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)

    To give employees the opportunity to earn additional income without disrupting their employment with the city, breaching the conflict of interest policy or any other policies herein, the city of Tucumcari has a policy to allow employees to engage in outside employment under certain conditions. 
    An employee may engage in outside employment. However, no employee may engage in outside employment, which, in any manner, interferes with proper and effective job performance, results in a conflict of interest or may subject the city to public criticism or embarrassment. Employees engaged in or wishing to engage in outside employment must first have the written approval of their immediate supervisor and the city manager. A request that is denied is not grievable. 
    Employees may engage in outside voluntary activities that are on an unpaid basis, so long as those activities do not represent a conflict of interest, impair their ability to perform their work, or employ city assets and resources. 
1.	No employee may engage in outside employment while absent from work using any leave benefits (other than annual leave), without prior written approval from the supervisor. 
2.	The employee may not make material changes to such outside employment without the approval of their immediate supervisor and the city manager.

(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.120 - Nepotism. 
    Nepotism, the showing of favoritism or giving preferential treatment to near relatives or to unrelated persons who are cohabiting based upon that relationship rather than on an objective evaluation of ability or suitability, resulting in actual or perceived preferential treatment in the hiring, appointment, pay, promotion, transfers, benefits and management of family members is prohibited. "Near relatives" for purposes of this policy are defined as: employee's spouse or ex-spouse, children, parents, siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, first cousins, and like relations of the employee's spouse. This definition includes any person related to the employee by birth, adoption, or marriage. This includes any person who would fall under the above definition if the persons who are cohabiting were in fact married. 
    Near relatives will not be hired into a department where the employee directly supervises or is supervised by another immediate family member. 
    Employees will not influence or participate in the hiring, promotion, transfers or management of near relatives. If an employee is scheduled to be part of a panel interview for a near relative, the employee will decline his/her involvement. The supervisor will provide a substitute for that employee for that particular panel interview. 
    If employees become near relatives after employment and a conflict of interest or management problems of supervision, safety, security or morale result; or, if a government operations reorganization creates such a conflict, reasonable time may be provided to resolve the matter. If a resolution is not possible, the city may require one of those employees to be transferred or laid-off. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.130 - Employment of minors. 
    As a general rule, employees of the city must be eighteen (18) years of age or older. Occasionally, the city may hire students or others who are as young as fourteen (14) years old, but this is done only under special conditions, usually under the provisions of a grant agreement, and must be approved by the city manager's office. In no case will minors be permitted to work in any occupation declared to be hazardous or detrimental to their health or well-being by the U.S. Secretary of Labor. 
    Minors younger than eighteen (18) years of age must provide a signed parental permission form to the city in order to work, including a parental permission for the provision of emergency medical care. 
  Minors who are sixteen (16) or seventeen (17) years old may perform any non-hazardous job for unlimited hours.

    Wages and/or stipends will be determined as provided in the grant agreement and approved by the city manager's office. 
    Students and/or minors who hold stipend assignments must satisfy the training program requirements of the position and the conduct of the services to ensure compliance with the associated regulations for stipends. All other positions for students are considered employment and associated tax withholding will be maintained. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.140 - Reduction-in-force (RIF). 
    If it becomes necessary for the city to reduce the number of city employees because of economic conditions, termination of a grant, organizational changes, lack of funds, lack of work or other circumstances the supervisor may implement adjustments in staff levels by means of a personnel RIF. 
    Before instituting a RIF, the supervisor, department head, human resources department and city manager will explore reasonable possibilities for reassignment of affected employees and will consider requirements to maintain the city's operations. 
    Selection of employees to be RIF'd will be done without regard to the employee's race/color, national origin, sex (gender, sexual orientation and condition of pregnancy), religion, age, disability, or any status protected by law. 
    The city manager's office and/or human resources department will provide assistance throughout the RIF process to accomplish any possible inter-department transfers of personnel and communication. The city manager shall have final approval on all RIF. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
Article 2. - Compensation 

2.64.150 - Compensation administration. 
    No employee will be paid less than the applicable legal minimum wage. 
    The city strives to pay salaries that are internally and externally equitable, and to provide fair and competitive pay for work performed. In order to accomplish this goal, each job, or position within the city of Tucumcari has been formally described in a written position description that describes in summary form the purpose of the position, the essential duties and responsibilities of the position, the supervision given and received, the minimum qualification standards that must be met by a candidate for employment to be hired for the position, the physical demands of the position and the typical work environment experienced when performing the work. 
    Based on the position description, each position has been evaluated on objective factors with consideration given to current competitive labor-market conditions and assigned to a pay grade, which establishes the value of the position in relation to other positions in the organization. 
    Starting Salary. Determination of the specific starting salary will be based on previous experience, knowledge, skills, abilities and education. Consideration must also be given to current employees in the position, their experience, qualifications and pay. Internal fairness is important, to reflect comparable pay for comparable skills, responsibilities and objectives. 
    Starting salaries will be determined in consultation with the city manager prior to making the job offer. 
    Wage Increase. Through the city's annual budgeting process, depending on the availability of funds, the board of commissioners may approve a wage increase for all employees. When such an increase is approved, it will become effective for each employee after final budget approval of the department of finance administration and the city manager. Employees on probation may be eligible for a wage increase upon completion of the probationary period, with the city manager's approval. 
    Performance Based Increase. Performance based Increases are related to the achievements and contributions of the employee as determined during the annual performance evaluation (See Section 2.64.160 Employee performance appraisal section), along with business considerations and conditions; budgetary constraints will also affect such decisions. 
    Performance based increases, if awarded, are generally provided for in amounts determined through the city's annual budgeting process. When budgeted funds are available, the supervisor may recommend a salary increase by completing a recommendation form and submitting it along with a copy of the employee's performance appraisal form to the city manager for approval. Compensation changes will generally be effective on the first pay period following the city manager's approval. 
    Certification Increases. Employees who receive approved certifications for their department will receive a five percent increase effective at the start of the next pay period, following submittal to the human resources department. 
    Promotional Increases. When an employee is transferred or promoted, salary changes associated with the move are generally granted immediately upon the effective date of the change of position (See Transfers and promotions section). The amount of a compensation adjustment is determined by the city manager in comparison to other incumbents for internal equity and the budget for compensation approved for the department concerned. 
    Employees who are placed in an "interim" or "acting" position are not automatically entitled to an increase in salary. This decision will be made by the city manager on a case-by-case basis. If the employee receives an increase, it will be considered temporary and will cease with the conclusion of the interim appointment. Loss of an interim appointment and any raise in pay accompanying the appointment are considered temporary and are not grievable. The interim employee retains whatever employment status he or she had prior to the appointment to an interim position. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.160 - Employee performance evaluations. 
    It is the policy of the city that each employee's job performance will be evaluated formally on an annual basis. Evaluations are conducted by the employee's supervisor. The performance evaluation will be conducted objectively and constructively on the basis of departmental and program mission, goals and objectives, position responsibilities and the employee's annual performance plan (see procedure). The employee's performance evaluation is the most important consideration when decisions regarding performance based merit increases are made. Evaluations do not automatically result in salary increases. No discussion of compensation will occur during the performance evaluation. All employees will receive a formal performance review upon the successful completion of their introductory period and annually thereafter on their anniversary date. (See Compensation administration section) 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.170 - Work schedule. 
    The city of Tucumcari's normal workday is 8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. with one hour for lunch. Other regular hours may be established by the city manager or upon request from the department head to meet the department's needs. Once established, the work schedule will be adhered to on a consistent basis. 
    Lunch breaks and other office absences are to be coordinated with other staff and management when necessary, to maintain coverage of services. Employees who work an eight-hour day will have two fifteen-minute breaks each day; one break will be scheduled at mid-morning and the second will be scheduled at mid-afternoon. 
    The scheduling of break and meal periods is the responsibility of the supervisor, who will ensure that proper coordination occurs so that business operations are maintained.

Employees will designate, on a form provided by the human resource department, the bank and the account number(s) where they want their paycheck deposited. Employees may change their designated bank and account(s) at any time by contacting the human resource department and completing another form. 
    If an employee discovers an error in their paycheck, he or she must notify their supervisor immediately. The supervisor will investigate the error and contact the payroll office. The payroll office will review the information and make any necessary adjustments. Adjustments will generally be made on the next paycheck. If no adjustment is necessary, an explanation will be provided to the employee. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.190 - On-call and call-back pay. 
    Some employees of the city, by the nature of their duties, are on-call to respond to emergencies that may arise outside of normal working hours. Employees will be notified of their on-call status by their supervisor. On-call employees are required to report to the scene of the emergency within thirty (30) minutes of being called. Other response requirements may be established by the supervisor and approved by the department head to meet the needs of specific departments. On-call employees will be provided a cell phone to be used while on-call. 
    Hourly employees required to be on call for five consecutive days shall receive eight hours of compensation at their applicable overtime rate of pay. 
    Hourly employees who are called back to work outside of their regular work day will be paid for all hours actually worked at their regular rate of pay, unless they qualify for overtime, for which they will be paid time and a half. 
    If no work is available after an employee responds to a call, the employee will receive not less than one hour's pay for responding. 
    Failure of the on-call employee to respond to a call may result in corrective disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.200 - Timekeeping. 
    All employees are required to complete a time sheet for each week of work, including exempt employees. The time sheets are to be completed showing all actual hours worked, and all compensated time-off such as annual leave, sick leave, holiday, etc. The time sheet will be signed by both the employee and the supervisor. 
1.	Employees are responsible for submitting accurate time sheets, including all annual leave, holiday or other paid/unpaid leave forms taken in a pay period. Falsifying any time record is prohibited. 
2.	Employees will sign their own time sheet for each pay period and give it to their supervisor. An employee is not permitted to record time for another employee.

5.	Exempt employees will keep track of their hours so that the city can keep a record of the employee's use of sick and annual leave. An exempt employee who takes leave of less than four hours at a time will not lose compensation as a result. Time off in excess of four hours shall be designated as sick or annual leave, as appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.210 - Overtime. 
    Overtime for purposes of this policy is defined as those hours worked in excess of forty (40) in any one work week by an hourly (non-exempt) employee. 
    All overtime must be approved by the employee's supervisor before the work is performed. Failure to obtain authorization to work overtime may be grounds for disciplinary action. Overtime work should not be approved unless funds are available. (See also: Section 2.64.220 Compensatory time off section.) 
    Overtime compensation, unless compensatory time-off is offered (see below) will be paid to hourly employees, according to the following:

  The minimum overtime that will be compensated is fifteen (15) minutes. 
  Only hours actually worked will be used to calculate overtime pay. Paid time off for annual leave, sick leave, jury duty, management initiated work release, or any other type of leave will not be considered as "hours worked." 
  Overtime for hourly paid police officers, fire fighters, paramedics and EMTs will be calculated based on the special rules provided for these occupations by the U.S. Department of Labor and the provisions of Section 7(k) of the U.S. Fair Labor Standards Act. 
  Premium pay for overtime will not be pyramided. An hour compensated at the overtime premium rate will not be counted again for the payment of premium pay for any other reason. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.220 - Compensatory time-off. 
    At the discretion of the supervisor, hourly employees may be granted paid time off (compensatory or "comp" time) in lieu of receiving pay for overtime worked.

(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)
2.64.240 - Termination administration. 
    It is the policy of the city of Tucumcari to administer terminations of employment consistently and ensure that terminating employees receive required benefit continuation notifications and a timely issuance of their final paycheck and accrued benefits. Termination includes voluntary resignations and disciplinary discharge. Two consecutive days of failing to report for work without notification to the supervisor will be treated as a voluntary resignation (see: Attendance section). 
    When an employee resigns from employment, the employee shall give at least two weeks advance notice to their immediate supervisor to ensure the timely processing of the termination and issuance of a final payroll check. Failure to provide advance notice may preclude the re-hiring of the employee in the future. 
    The city reserves the right to accelerate the final day of employment when accepting an employee's resignation, but the employee will be paid through the resignation date or the actual last day of work, whichever is later. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)

Article 3. - Attendance and Time-Off 

2.64.260 - Attendance. 
    Unexpected absences from work and tardiness in reporting to work disrupt the city's ability to deliver the high quality of service its citizens expect. In order to minimize these disruptions in service delivery and to ensure a productive and efficient work effort the city has established the following attendance policy and procedures. 
    When unexpected situations come up occasionally, which may require an employee to be absent from work, the employee must notify their supervisor within thirty (30) minutes of their regularly scheduled starting time that he or she cannot report for work or needs to leave the worksite early. Notification to a person other than the immediate supervisor, when that supervisor is at work, is not acceptable and is cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge in the rare instances when employees are unable to report to work as scheduled, or know they will be late, they must notify their supervisor within thirty (30) minutes of the start of the regularly scheduled work day. If an employee must leave work early, they must notify their supervisor as soon as possible. 
    Irregular attendance, excessive absenteeism, repeated tardiness or absence without notice is cause for disciplinary action up to and including discharge. 
    If an employee is unable to provide notice, the employee is responsible for having someone do it for them. When calling in absent, every employee must: 
a.	State the reason for the absence (personal, illness, transportation, etc.).
b.	Leave a phone number where he or she can be reached.
c.	Notify the supervisor when they can be expected to report back to work.
d.	Employees will maintain daily contact with their supervisor for any period of absence beyond one day, unless he or she has provided a health care provider's certification covering a specified period. 
    All personal and health care provider appointments should be scheduled whenever possible to accommodate the city's established working hours. 
    An employee who is absent for two consecutive work days without providing proper notice is considered to have voluntarily resigned his or her job. 
(Ord. No. 1114, § 1, 8-14-2014)

    A legal drug is a drug which is prescribed by a physician or available over-the-counter. 
    The city requires any employee taking legal drug(s) which may impair the employee's ability to safely perform their job functions to report the use of the medication to their immediate supervisor. The supervisor may assign other duties or grant sick leave time-off if the employee is unable to perform his/her assigned duties or perform any duties in a safe manner. If the use of a legal drug impairs the employee's ability to safely perform the essential functions of the employee's job, transfer or even termination may be considered. 
Employee Testing 
    Employees will be required to undergo drug and substance abuse testing upon the following conditions: 
  Pre-Employment: The city will test all applicants who receive an offer of employment. The city will revoke a job offer to any applicant who tests positive for any illegal drug. 
  Reasonable Cause: If the supervisor has reasonable cause (see: Definitions and Acronyms), the employee will be required to submit to a substance abuse test; refusal to do so will be grounds for disciplinary action, up to and including discharge. When a motor vehicle accident occurs that results in injury to a person or damage to property, it will be considered as reasonable cause for testing of the employee(s) involved, which may include a blood alcohol test. 
  Random: Employees who have had positive test results, or who have been convicted of any criminal alcohol/drug statute will be required to submit to random substance abuse tests as a condition of continued employment, whether or not they are involved in a rehabilitation process. A positive test result during random screening will result in immediate discharge. 
  Job-Specific: Positions that by their nature can affect public safety, including CDL operators, will be designated as those requiring random testing after hire. Any such requirement shall be indicated in the position description. 
  Motor Vehicle Accidents: An employee who is involved in a motor vehicle accident while on duty which results in property damage or personal will be tested in all circumstances, regardless of fault. 
Testing Procedures 
    The city will determine the type and manner of drug and alcohol testing, including what constitutes a positive test result at its sole discretion. Test samples will be collected in a reasonable and sanitary area and will be labeled and handled in such a way reasonably designed to preclude sample contamination, adulteration or misidentification. The city is entitled to rely on the results of its drug or alcohol testing to determine if any employee has violated this policy and is subject to corrective disciplinary action. 
    All drug or alcohol testing will be performed by a certified laboratory facility, using scientifically accepted analytical procedures and meeting confidentiality requirements. This facility has been identified and its name and address is on file in the city manager's office. 
    Positive results of alcohol and drug testing guidelines are established by the department of health and human services will be used to determine whether an employee test positive. Any employee who test positive for drugs or alcohol will be dismissed. 
    An employee has the right to have the original sample retested at the employee's own expense. Inconsistent test results will be reviewed by the city manager, who has the discretion to accept the retest results or to request an additional test. The ultimate decision of the reliability of the results will be made by the city manager. 
    At the time of testing, a person will be given the chance to provide any information that may be relevant to the test, including whether the person is taking prescription or over the counter medication or undergoing any medical treatment that may affect the result of the test. Additionally, individuals will be given the chance to explain a positive test result in a confidential setting. 
Threshold of Positive Results 
    The positive results thresholds are as follows: 
  Alcohol: A blood alcohol concentration of 0.02, except that for individuals holding a CDL as a job requirement, any test greater than 0.00 is considered positive. 
  Illegal Drugs: Current limits set by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to indicate confirmed presence of the drugs. 
  Prescription Drugs: Sample levels in excess of what would be expected by using the drugs as prescribed by the attending physician or where the drug has not been prescribed to that employee.

If direct discussion is not practical or safe, or the situation is not satisfactorily resolved by the employee and the offending person, then it is imperative that the behavior perceived as harassment be reported as soon as possible to the city manager and/or the human resources director. This immediacy allows for swift investigation, action and resolution. Notification of the problem is essential. 
3.	It is the responsibility of the employee to make this report, as management cannot investigate or remedy situations of which they are not aware. 
4.	Once the city manager or human resources has been notified of a harassment problem, the employee's supervisor will be notified, unless the supervisor is one of the offending parties. All complaints will be treated seriously and will be investigated as promptly and thoroughly as possible. 
5.	Any employee found, through the investigation, to be violating this policy will be subject to corrective disciplinary action (see: Corrective disciplinary action policy). 
6.	The city prohibits employees from hindering internal investigations.
7.	All reported complaints of harassment will be treated with as much confidentiality as possible, consistent with the city's confidentiality policy, and the need to conduct an adequate investigation, while protecting the privacy of those involved.

    A labor organization that has been certified by the board as the exclusive representative for employees in an appropriate bargaining unit shall represent all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall act for all employees in the bargaining unit and negotiate a collective bargaining agreement covering all employees in the bargaining unit. The exclusive representative shall represent the interests of all employees in the bargaining unit without discrimination or regard to membership or nonmembership in the labor organization. The existence of an exclusive bargaining representative shall not prevent employees from taking their grievances through the grievance process or filing prohibited practices with the board. Any settlement of a grievance or relief given on a prohibited practice brought by an individual shall not be inconsistent with or in violation of the collective bargaining agreement in effect between the employer and the exclusive representative or inconsistent with or in violation of a memorandum of understanding between the employer and the exclusive representative applicable to the day-to-day administration of the collective bargaining agreement. The exclusive representative shall be afforded the opportunity to be present at such hearings and make its views known. 
(Ord. 999 § 12, 2004)
2.76.130 - Decertification of exclusive representative. 
A.	Any member of a labor organization or the labor organization itself may initiate decertification of a labor organization as the exclusive representative if thirty (30) percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit make a written request to the board for a decertification election. A decertification election shall be valid only if at least forty (40) percent of the eligible employees in the bargaining unit vote in the election. 
B.	When there is a collective bargaining agreement in effect, a request for a decertification election shall be made to the board no earlier than ninety (90) days and no later than sixty (60) days before the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement; provided, however, that a request for a decertification election may be filed at any time after the expiration of the third year of a collective bargaining agreement with a term of more than three years. 
C.	When, within the time period prescribed in subsection B of this section, a competing labor organization files a petition containing signatures of at least thirty (30) percent of the employees in the appropriate bargaining unit, a representation election rather than a decertification election shall be conducted. 
D.	When an exclusive representative has been certified but no collective bargaining agreement is in effect, the board shall not accept a request for a decertification election earlier than twelve (12) months subsequent to a labor organization's certification as the exclusive representative.

The parties shall enter into a written agreement covering employment relations regarding the issues agreed to in collective bargaining. 
B.	Bargaining in good faith shall not require either party to agree to a proposal or to make a concession. 
C.	The obligation to bargain collectively imposed by the labor management relations ordinance shall not be construed as authorizing employers and exclusive representatives to enter into any agreement that is in conflict with state statutes or federal statutes. In the event of conflict between the provision of any federal or state statutes and any agreement entered into by the employer and the exclusive representative, the former shall prevail. 
D.	Payroll deduction of the exclusive representative's membership dues shall be a mandatory subject of bargaining if either party chooses to negotiate the issue. The amount of dues shall be certified in writing by an official of the labor organization and shall not include special assessments, penalties, or fines of any type levied by the exclusive representative. During the time that a board certification is in effect for a particular exclusive representative, the employer shall not deduct dues for any other labor organization from members of the same bargaining unit. 
E.	Any agreement or impasse resolution by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds to fund the agreed upon provision. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the re-appropriation of funds. 
F.	The parties have a requirement that a grievance procedure culminating with final and binding arbitration be negotiated. This applies only to grievances and the interpretation and application of the agreement between the parties and does not apply to negotiation impasses. The parties shall share the cost of any proceedings conducted pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party is responsible for paying any cost related to its witnesses and representation.

5.	Agreement on contract negotiations is accomplished when the union president and the city manager sign the agreement. Provisions in multiyear agreements providing for economic increases for subsequent years shall be contingent upon the governing body appropriating the funds necessary to fund the increase for the subsequent year(s). Should the governing body not appropriate sufficient funds to fund the agreed upon increase, either party may reopen negotiations. 
C.	The following impasse procedure shall be followed by the employer and exclusive representative:
1.	If an impasse occurs, either party shall request mediation assistance. If the parties cannot agree on a mediator, either party may request the assistance of the federal mediation and conciliation service. 
2.	If the impasse continues after thirty (30) calendar days, either party may request an unrestricted list of seven arbitrators from the federal mediation and conciliation service. The parties shall choose one arbitrator by alternately striking names from such list. Which party strikes the first name shall be determined by coin toss. The arbitrator shall render a final, binding, written decision resolving unresolved issues no later than thirty (30) calendar days after the arbitrator has been notified of his or her selection by the parties. The arbitrator's decision shall be limited to a selection of one of the two parties' complete, last, best offer. However, an impasse resolution decision of an arbitrator or an agreement provision by the employer and an exclusive representative that requires the expenditure of funds shall be contingent upon the specific appropriation of funds by the governing body and the availability of funds. An arbitrator's decision shall not require the employer to re-appropriate funds. The parties shall share all of the arbitrator's costs incurred pursuant to this subsection equally. Each party shall be responsible for paying any costs related to its witnesses and representation. The decision shall be subject to judicial review pursuant to the standards set forth in the Uniform Arbitration Act. 
3.	In the event that an impasse continues after the expiration of a contract, the existing contract will continue in full force and effect until it is replaced by a subsequent written agreement. However, this shall not require the employer to increase any employees' levels, steps, or grades of compensation contained in the existing contract.

Multifamily residential property containing five or more dwelling units shall be considered vacant when substantially (sixty (60) percent) all of the dwelling units are unoccupied. Lodging and multi-unit commercial properties shall be considered vacant when substantially (sixty (60) percent) of the units are unfit for use or unoccupied. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the city manager determines that a substantial, unoccupied portion of an otherwise occupied structure has the potential for becoming a nuisance or having a negative effect on the neighborhood, the city manager may notify the property owner that a vacant building maintenance license shall be required for the unoccupied portion of the otherwise occupied building. If a vacant building is used for the storage of materials related to a commercial enterprise, the owner must possess a valid business license consistent with said business. If stored materials are not related to a commercial enterprise and determined by the city manager or designee to be a nuisance, fire hazard or having a negative effect on the neighborhood, the owner may not obtain a vacant building maintenance license until such time as the unacceptable conditions are addressed.

(2)	The liabilities and obligations imposed on an owner shall attach to any mortgage company or any other person with or without an interest in the building or premises who knowingly takes any action in any judicial or administrative proceeding that is intended to delay issuance or enforcement of any remedy for any violation of this chapter; provided that with respect to fines such person shall be liable only for fines which accrue on or after the date of such action; and further provided that no liability shall be imposed under this chapter for any action taken in any proceeding, including a proceeding to foreclose on a lien, that does not delay or prevent the prosecution of any action brought by the city manager or designee to enforce this chapter. 
B.	Civil Penalties.
(1)	Thirty (30) days after a building becomes a vacant building with no vacant building maintenance license application, or renewal application, having been submitted, the owner shall be liable for a civil penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00). The city manager's designee shall notify the owner as provided in Section 7.10.040F of the statutory penalty. 
(2)	The owner shall have thirty (30) days after notification of the initial five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty to acquire a vacant building maintenance license or to renew a vacant building maintenance license. The city manager may abate all or a portion of the initial five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty if the owner acquires or renews that vacant building maintenance license within the thirty-day period after notification of the initial penalty and if the city manager finds that imposition of the initial five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty would be unjust. 
(3)	If no vacant building maintenance license is acquired or renewed within thirty (30) days after the notification of the initial five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty, the owner shall be liable for a second five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty. 
(4)	If the owner of the building is continuing to maintain a vacant building without a vacant building maintenance license after being notified, pursuant to Section 7.10.040F, of the second five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty, the city manager may impose daily civil penalties of up to one hundred dollars ($100.00) per day for every day an owner maintains a building without a vacant building license after receiving notification of the second five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty. Each day after receiving notification of the second five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty is a separate occurrence and a separate violation of this chapter. The city manager shall notify, pursuant to Section 7.10.040F, the owner of the accrual of the civil penalties at least once per week. 
(5)	The city manager may abate the second five hundred dollar ($500.00) civil penalty or any subsequent daily penalties only upon the owner affirmatively establishing that the owner was not negligent in failing to comply with this chapter. 
(6)	The city manager may extend the time periods for acquiring or renewing a vacant building maintenance license, if a request for extension is made prior to the expiration of any time period and if the owner or other interested party is engaged in good faith negotiations with the city manager or city manager's designee regarding the conditions or requirements of any vacant building maintenance license. 
C.	Lien. In addition to being the personal liability of the owner, the civil penalties provided in this chapter shall be a lien on the property and may be filed and foreclosed in the manner provided by NMSA §§ 3-36-1 through 3-36-7. With regard to an innocent creditor with a mortgage on the property, the city manager may subordinate all or part of the civil penalty to the mortgage if the city manager finds that enforcing the statutory priority of the penalty assessment lien would be unjust under the circumstances. 
D.	Criminal Penalties. Any violation of this chapter may, in addition to any other remedy provided by law, be punished in accordance with the city's criminal code procedure. 
E.	Judicial Enforcement. The city manager may bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to acquire preliminary injunctive relief or any other appropriate remedy to enforce this chapter.

B.	If the city manager refuses to exercise his discretion to abate, reduce or subordinate a civil penalty that has been properly imposed, such refusal shall not be reviewable by appeal.

(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.090 - State requirements. 
    State requirements and limitations on discharges to the POTW shall be met by all users which are subject to such standards in any instance in which they are more stringent than federal requirements and limitations, or those in this ordinance or other applicable ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.100 - Local limits. 
    In addition to Sections [13.08B.050] and [13.08B.060], the following pollutant limits are established to protect against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following daily maximum allowable discharge limits. 
Boron .....352 ug/L 
Chromium .....5.16 ug/L 
Diazinon .....0.079 ug/L 
Selenium .....2.34 ug/L 
    The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is discharged to the POTW (end of the pipe). Categorical pretreatment standards apply at the end of the process. However, the director may elect to have local limits apply after pretreatment and/or prior to mixing with dilution flows. All concentrations for metallic substances are for "total" metal unless indicated otherwise. The department may impose mass limitations in addition to (or in place of) the concentration based limitations above. Where a user is subject to a categorical pretreatment standard and a local limit for a given pollutant, the more stringent limit or applicable pretreatment standard shall apply. The city commission authorizes the director to revise local limits. 
(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.110 - City's right of revision.

Grease and oil traps shall be installed in all new filling stations, garages, restaurants, and other new facilities where heavy discharge of grease and oil is to be expected and shall be in accordance with the New Mexico Environment Department. 
(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.140 - Maintenance of preliminary treatment or flow-equalizing facilities. 
    Where preliminary treatment or equalization facilities are provided for any industrial liquid wastes, they shall be maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at their expense. Whenever deemed necessary, the director may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter. When determined necessary by the director, each user discharging into the POTW shall install and maintain, on his property and at his expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to insure equalization of flow. The director may require the facility to be equipped with alarms and a rate of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be determined by the director.

Such manhole, when required, shall be accessibly and safely located, constructed in such a manner as to prevent infiltration of ground and surface waters, and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the city. The manhole shall be installed by the owner at their expense, and shall be maintained by the user so as to be safe and accessible at all times. The control manhole shall be located so that sampling of industrial waste can be performed prior to discharge into the public sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.160 - Sampling and testing methods. 
    All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with the established procedures recommended by the New Mexico Environment Department and shall be determined at the control manhole or upon suitable samples taken from the manhole. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the wastewater treatment works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular analyses involved will determine whether a twenty-four-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate, or whether a grab sample or samples should be taken. (Typically COD, BOD, and settleable solids analyses are obtained from twenty-four-hour composites of all outfalls, whereas pH is determined from periodic grab samples or continuous meter.) The director shall be allowed access to the properties of all users as necessary to sample, test and measure all wastewater discharges. Failure to allow such access may, at the city's discretion, is the basis for Section [13.08B.170]. 
(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.170 - Enforcement provisions. 
1.	Whenever the director finds that a user has violated or is violating this chapter, the city shall serve upon such person a written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within ten (10) days of receipt of such notice, the user shall submit to the director an explanation of the violation and a plan for satisfactorily correcting such violation. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
2.	Whenever the director finds that any User has violated or continues to violate this chapter, the director may issue an order to the user responsible for the violation directing that, following a specified time period, further enforcement proceedings will be pursued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances have been properly installed and are properly operated. These administrative orders may also contain such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment technology, additional monitoring and management practices. 
3.	The city may suspend the wastewater treatment service, water service and/or wastewater discharge city permit when, in the opinion of the director, such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES and/or GWDP permit. The city may also suspend the wastewater treatment service, water service and/or wastewater discharge permit when, in the opinion of the director, such suspension is necessary to enforce User's compliance with the requirements of their permit, information requirements for permit issuance or construction of pretreatment facilities and/or monitoring facilities. 
4.	Any person affected by an order or directive of the city issued pursuant to this division may, within ten (10) days of the issuance of such order or directive, request a hearing before the city to show cause why such order should be modified or made not to apply to such person. Such request shall be in writing and addressed to the city manager at P.O. Box 1188, 215 E. Center Street, Tucumcari, N.M. 88401. The city shall hold the requested hearing as soon as practical after receiving the request. At the conclusion of the hearing the director shall issue a written response to the person requesting the hearing either affirming or modifying the questioned order or directive. Any appeal of the city's decision shall be as provided by state law. 
5.	Any user who has violated or continues to violate any provisions of this division or permit or order issued hereunder, shall be liable to the city for a civil penalty of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) per day for as long as the violation continues. In addition to the above described penalty and damages, the city may recover reasonable attorney's fees, court costs and other expenses associated with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring costs. 
(Ord. No. 1123, 7-23-2015)
13.08B.180 - Industrial sewage surcharge. 
    In addition to the monthly base usage rates per city ordinance, a surcharge will be assessed against users discharging industrial sewage that exceed the strength of normal, untreated domestic wastewater, defined in the chart below. The monthly industrial sewage surcharge charged to all city users will be computed based upon the following schedule, based on eighty percent (80%) of water usage, or as determined by the wastewater meter. The industrial sewage surcharge will be charged at the largest volume which results from the application of the following mathematical relationships: 
SR = (Vi) {(Kss)(SS-5)/5 + (KCOD)(COD-400)/400} 
or 
SR = (Vi) {(Kss)(SS-5)/5 + (KBOD)(BOD-200)/200} 
Where: 
SR = Surcharge in dollars per month; such surcharge is in addition to the regular monthly user fee. 
Vi = Volume of waste water used. 
Kss = the charge in dollars to treat the extra settleable solids in one thousand (1,000) gallons of wastewater. One dollar forty-two cents ($1.42) per thousand gallons. 
KCOD = the charge in dollars to treat the extra COD in one thousand (1,000) gallons of wastewater. One dollar fifty-six cents ($1.56) per thousand gallons. 
KBOD = the charge in dollars to treat the extra BOD in one thousand (1,000) gallons of wastewater. One dollar fifty-six cents ($1.56) per thousand gallons.

These factors include retransmission consent fees, programming costs, state and local taxes applicable to the provision of cable television service, and costs of franchise requirements. The total cost of an increase in a franchise fee may be automatically added to the base per channel rate, without regard to its relation to the GNP-PI. 
2.	For all categories of external costs other than retransmission consent and franchise fees, the starting date for measuring changes in external costs for which the basic service per channel rate may be adjusted will be the date on which the basic service tier becomes subject to regulation or February 28, 1994, whichever occurs first. The permitted per channel charge may not be adjusted for costs of retransmission consent fees or changes in those fees incurred before October 6, 1994. 
C.	Notification and Review. The cable operator shall notify the city at least thirty (30) days in advance of a rate increase based on automatic adjustment items. The city shall review the increase to determine whether the item or items qualify as automatic adjustments.

Chapter 15.28 - FLOOD CONTROL 
Sections: 
Article 1. - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 

15.28.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the state of New Mexico has in Section 14-17-5.1, New Mexico State Statutes Annotated 1953 Comp., delegated the responsibility of local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to minimize flood losses. Therefore, the city commission of the city of Tucumcari, New Mexico, does ordain as follows: 
(Ord. 985 (part), 2003: Ord. 765 § I(A), 1987)
15.28.020 - Findings. 
A.	The flood hazard areas of the city of Tucumcari are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, and extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.	These flood loses are created by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains which cause an increase in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazards areas by uses vulnerable to floods and hazardous to other lands because they are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. 985 (part), 2003: Ord. 765 § I(B), 1987)
15.28.030 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.	Protect human life and health;
B.	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C.	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.	Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E.	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
F.	Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood-prone areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; and 
G.	Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
(Ord. 985 (part), 2003: Ord. 765 § I(C), 1987)
15.28.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter uses the following methods: 
A.	Restrict or prohibit uses that are dangerous to health, safety or property in times of flood, or cause excessive increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
D.	Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. 985 (part), 2003: Ord. 765 § I(D), 1987)
15.28.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Alluvial fan flooding" means flooding occurring on the surface of an alluvial fan or similar landform which originates at the apex and is characterized by high-velocity flows; active processes of erosion, sediment transport, and deposition; and unpredictable flow paths. 
    "Apex" means a point on an alluvial fan or similar landform below which the flow path of the major stream that formed the fan becomes unpredictable and alluvial fan flooding can occur. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one percent chance or greater annual chance of flooding to an average depth of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. The area may be designated as Zone A on the Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM). After detailed ratemaking has been completed in preparation for publication of the FIRM, Zone A usually is refined into Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-99, VO, V1-30, VE or V. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Critical feature" means an integral and readily identifiable part of a flood protection system, without which the flood protection provided by the entire system would be compromised. 
    "Development" means any man-made change in improved and unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Elevated building" means a non-basement building (i) built, in the case of a building in Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the floor of the water and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, and D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of flood waters. In the case of Zones V1-30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls if the breakaway walls met the standards of Section 60.3(e)(5) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations. 
    "Existing construction" means for the purposes of determining rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced before the effective date of the FIRM or before January 1, 1975, for FIRMs effective before that date. "Existing construction" may also be referred to as "existing structures." 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: 
1.	The overflow of inland or tidal waters;
2.	The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
    "Flood insurance rate map (firm)" means an official map of a community, on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood insurance study" is the official report provided by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The report contains flood profiles, water surface elevation of the base flood, as well as the flood boundary-floodway map. 
    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of flooding). 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    "Flood protection system" means those physical structural works for which funds have been authorized, appropriated, and expended and which have been constructed specifically to modify flooding in order to reduce the extent of the areas within a community subject to a "special flood hazard" and the extent of the depths of associated flooding. Such a system typically includes hurricane tidal barriers, dams, reservoirs, levees or dikes. These specialized flood modifying works are those constructed in conformance with sound engineering standards. 
    "Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and non-structural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents. 
    "Floodway (regulatory floodway)" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than a designated height. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use, which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, but does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.	Certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.	Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of Interior; or 
4.	Individually listed on a local inventory or historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either: 
a.	By an approved state program as determined by the secretary of the Interior or;
b.	Directly by the secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs.
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system, which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure, and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building's lowest floor; provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirement of Section 60.3 of the national flood insurance program regulations. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the national flood insurance program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    "New construction" means, for the purpose of determining insurance rates, structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of an initial FIRM or after December 31, 1974, whichever is later, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. For floodplain management purposes, "new construction" means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.	Built on a single chassis;
2.	Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projections;
3.	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light duty truck; and
4.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    "Start of construction" (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (Pub. L. 97-348)), includes substantial improvement and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before "start of construction" of the improvement. This includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.	Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary conditions; or 
2.	Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
    "Variance" is a grant of relief to a person from the requirement of this chapter when specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship. A variance, therefore, permits construction or development in a manner otherwise prohibited by this chapter. (For full requirements, see Section 60.6 of the national flood insurance program regulations.) 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community's floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in Section 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4), (c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

15.28.160 - Variance procedures. 
A.	The planning commission as established by the city commission shall hear and render judgment on requests for variances from the requirements of this chapter. 
B.	The planning commission shall hear and render judgment on an appeal only when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. 
C.	Any person or persons aggrieved by the decision of the planning commission may appeal such decision in the courts of competent jurisdiction. 
D.	The floodplain administrator shall maintain a record of all actions involving an appeal and shall report variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
E.	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the national register of historic places or the state inventory of historic places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this chapter. 
F.	Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing the relevant factors in Section 15.28.150(B) of this article have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
G.	Upon consideration of the factors noted above and the intent of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purpose and objectives of this chapter (Article 1, Section 15.28.030). 
H.	Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
I.	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
J.	Prerequisites for granting variances:
1.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; 
2.	Variances shall only be issued upon:
a.	Showing a good and sufficient cause;
b.	A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
c.	A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
3.	Any application to which a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with the lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation, and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
K.	Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that: 
1.	The criteria outlined in Article 3, Section 15.28.160(A)-(I) are met; and 
2.	The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no additional threats to public safety.

    In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in (i) Article 2, Section 15.28.070, (ii) Article 3, Section 15.28.140(H), or (iii) Article 4, Section 15.28.190(C), the following provisions are required: 
A.	Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor (including basement), elevated to or above the base flood elevation. A registered professional engineer, architect, or land surveyor shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standard of this subsection as proposed in Article 3, Section 15.28.150(A)(1), is satisfied. 
B.	Nonresidential Construction. New construction and substantial improvements of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop and/or review structural design, specifications, and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice as outlined in this subsection. A record of such certification, which includes the specific elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which such structures are flood proofed shall be maintained by the floodplain administrator. 
C.	Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements, with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: 
1.	A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided;

3.	Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
D.	Manufactured Homes.
1.	Require that all manufactured homes to be placed within Zone A on a community's FHBM or FIRM shall be installed using methods and practices, which minimize flood damage. For the purposes of this requirement, manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
2.	Require that manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM on sites (i) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, (ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision, (iii) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or (iv) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as a result of a flood, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
3.	Require that manufactured homes be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's FIRM that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (D) of this section be elevated so that either: 
a.	The lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
b.	The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
E.	Recreational Vehicles. Require that recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's FIRM either:

(Ord. 985 (part), 2003: Ord. 765 § V(C), 1987)
15.28.200 - Standards for areas of shallow flooding (AO zones). 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section 15.28.170, are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flows may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
A.	All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified). 
B.	All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures:
1.	Have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the community's FIRM (at least two feet if no depth number is specified); or 
2.	Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be designed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads of effects of buoyancy. 
C.	A registered professional engineer or architect shall submit a certification to the floodplain administrator that the standards of this section, as proposed in Article 3, Section 15.28.150(A)(1), are satisfied. 
D.	Require within Zones AH or AO adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes, to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(Ord. 985 (part), 2003: Ord. 765 § V(D), 1987)
15.28.210 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Article 2, Section 15.28.070, are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
A.	Encroachments are prohibited, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development within the adopted regulatory floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in accordance with standard engineering practice that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.	If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article 4. 
C.	Under the provisions of 44 CFR Chapter 1, Section 65.12, of the National Flood Insurance Regulations, a community may permit encroachments within the adopted regulatory floodway that would result in an increase in base flood elevations, provided that the community first applies for a conditional FIRM and floodway revision through FEMA.

(Ord. 985 (part), 2003)
15.28.240 - Penalty clause. 
    In accordance with Section 59.2(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) regulation, to qualify for the sale of federally-subsidized flood insurance, a community must adopt floodplain management regulations that meet or exceed the minimum standards of Section 60. "These regulations must include effective enforcement provisions." 
    In accordance with Section 60.1(b) of CFR 44, Chapter 1, of the NFIP regulations, "These regulations must be legally-enforceable, applied uniformly throughout the community to all privately and publicly owned land within flood-prone (i.e. mudflow) or flood-related erosion areas, and the community must provide that the regulations take precedence over less restrictive conflicting local laws, ordinances or codes." 
(Ord. 985 (part), 2003)
15.28.250 - Penalty for noncompliance. 
    No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations.

a.	The subdivision contains no more than two lots, provided, however, that submittal of a series of two lot subdivisions on a tract of land will be considered a subterfuge to defeat the purpose of these regulations and the plats shall not be approved. 
b.	Resubdivisions, where the combination or recombination of portions of previously platted lots does not increase the total number of lots. 
2.	In all cases, the subdivision plat being considered for approval under this summary procedure shall be prepared according to the standards for plans and data for both preliminary and final plats as contained herein. 
3.	The director shall furnish the planning commission with monthly reports documenting those subdivisions approved administratively. 
F.	Required Improvements.
1.	Authorization. Receipt of the signed copy of the preliminary plat is authorization for the subdivider to proceed with the minimum improvements required by these regulations. Prior to the construction of any improvements or to the submission of any bond, the subdivider shall furnish the city with all plans and data necessary for the construction of the improvements. These plans shall be examined by the city and will be approved if in accordance with the following requirements. Following the approval, construction can be started or the amount of bond determined. 
2.	Installation Assurance. Plans for improvement shall be prepared by an engineer registered in accordance with the laws of the state. The city is to be assured of the installation of these improvements in a satisfactory manner by one or more of the following methods: 
a.	Complete installation of the improvements prior to approval of the final plat;
b.	Submission of a satisfactory bond, either a performance bond or a cash bond, or the establishment of an escrow account in an amount and with surety and conditions satisfactory to the city clerk providing for and securing to the city, the actual construction and installation of the improvements and utilities within a period not to exceed one year; 
c.	Completion of an approved assessment procedure whereby the city is put in an assured position to do the work and make the installations at the cost of the owners of the property within the subdivision; 
d.	Submission of an approved assessment procedure for the paving of streets together with an agreement between the subdivider and the city for a cash payment for other improvements with payment to be made as the work is completed; 
e.	The city may authorize a written agreement between the city and the subdivider, which would be recorded at the time of filing of the final plat, which would adequately restrict sales of any lots as to which there had not been completion of the improvements and installation of utilities, and which would establish a ten (10) year time limit; and 
f.	The subdivision may be developed in segments whereby the city, at its discretion, may waive the use of a guarantee as required by the section on the initial segments, provided that such segments are not larger than twenty-five (25) lots or fifty (50) percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision, whichever is less. The city shall grant final plat approval for each succeeding segment being contingent upon completion of the minimum improvements required by these regulations in each preceding segment. Completion of improvements in the final segment of the subdivision, which shall include at least twenty-five (25) lots or fifty (50) percent of the total number of lots in the subdivision, whichever is less, must be guaranteed through the use of one of the other methods detailed under this section. 
3.	Installation of Improvements. The subdivider may prepare and secure approval of the preliminary plat and then install improvements in the area covered by the preliminary plat. Improvements must be installed only in that part of the area for which a final plat will be submitted for approval and filing. The improvements to be installed shall include the following: 
a.	Permanent Markers. All subdivision boundary corners and the four corners of all street intersections shall be marked with permanent monuments. A permanent monument shall be deemed to be concrete with a minimum dimension of four inches, extending three feet below the surface of the ground.

G.	Character of Development.
1.	The decisionmaking body shall confer with the subdivider regarding the type and character of development that will be permitted in the subdivision, and may agree with the subdivider as to certain minimum restrictions to be placed upon the property: 
a.	To prevent the construction of substandard buildings; and
b.	To control the type and use of structures and the use of lots which, unless so controlled, would clearly depreciate the character and value of the proposed subdivision and of adjoining property. 
2.	The decisionmaking body shall have power to agree with the subdivider upon the use, height, area or bulk restrictions governing building and premises, providing that, in the case of subdivisions beyond the corporate limits, the decisionmaking body may require the subdivider to conform to the land use plans adopted by the city. 
H.	Vacation of Plat.
1.	Nothing in this section requires that a vacation be undertaken if a replat, accomplishing the elimination of lot lines is duly approved. A vacation is required when no replatting is undertaken but elimination of lot lines, rights-of-way or easement lines dividing a parcel is to be accomplished. 
2.	Any plat, or portion thereof, filed in the office of the Quay County clerk and within the planning and platting jurisdiction of the city may be vacated according to the following procedures:

The applicant is responsible for removing the signs within five days after the hearing is completed. Failure to properly post signs is grounds for deferral of the request. No one except the applicant, the agent of the applicant, or the city shall remove or tamper with any such required sign during the period it is required to be maintained under this section. 
iii.	In considering the vacation of all or part of a public right-of-way, the governing body shall determine whether or not the vacation will adversely affect the interests of persons owning contiguous land or land within the subdivision being vacated. 
c.	The rights-of-way of any public or private utility, including drainage, existing prior to the vacation, total or partial, of any plat are not affected by the vacation of a plat unless an authorized representative of the utility involved agrees in writing to have the rights vacated. 
3.	A decision on approval and endorsement shall be made at a hearing by the governing body. Public notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city shall be published at least twenty (20) days before the date of the hearing; the notice shall indicate the location of the proposed vacation, where a map of the proposed vacation may be viewed, and information on the hearing. If approved by the governing body, the statement of vacation is endorsed "approved." The endorsement shall be within ten (10) days of the conclusion of the hearing.

E.	Blocks. The lengths, widths and shapes of blocks shall be determined with due regard to provision of adequate building sites suitable to the special needs of the type of use contemplated; to zoning requirements as to lot sizes and dimensions; to needs for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic; and to limitations and opportunities to topography. 
F.	Lots. The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will provide satisfactory and desirable building sites properly related to topography and the character of adjacent development. All side lines of lots shall be at right angles to straight street lines or radial to curved street lines unless a variation of this rule will give a better street and lot plan. Lots of double frontage shall not be permitted.
