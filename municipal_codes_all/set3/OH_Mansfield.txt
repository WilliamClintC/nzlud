CODIFIED ORDINANCES OF MANSFIELD, OHIO
      
CHARTER
      
PART ONE -    Administrative Code
      
PART THREE -    Traffic Code
      
PART FIVE -    General Offenses Code
      
PART SEVEN -    Business Regulation Code

PART FIFTEEN -    Fire Prevention Code
EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

CHARTER
FOR THE
CITY OF MANSFIELD, OHIO
PREAMBLE
         To ensure that we may have the benefits of municipal home rule and
exercise all of the powers of local self-government conferred under the
Constitution and statutes of the State of Ohio, We, the citizens of the City of
Mansfield, Ohio, do hereby adopt this Charter for our municipality.
ARTICLE I
NAME; BOUNDARIES; FORM OF GOVERNMENT
Section 1.01  Name and Boundary.
   The municipal corporation existing as the City of Mansfield under the
general statutes of the State of Ohio shall continue to be a body politic and
corporate under the same name under this Charter. The City shall have the same
boundaries that exist on the effective date of this Charter, with power and
authority to change its boundaries and annex territory in the same manner
authorized by the laws of Ohio.
Section 1.02  Form of Government.
   The municipal government provided for by this Charter shall be known as the
"Mayor-Council Plan".
Section 1.03.  Bill of Rights
   The rights of the citizens of the "home rule" municipality of the City of
Mansfield and the corporate City of Mansfield are derived and flow directly by
and from the Ohio Constitution and its "Bill of Rights," and are secured by the
Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the
United States. These rights include, but are not limited to, the Ohio
Constitution's proclamation that:
   "§ 1.01 Inalienable Rights (1851)
All men are, by nature, free and independent, and have certain inalienable
rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty,
acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, and seeking and obtaining
happiness and safety."
and
"§ 1.16 Redress in courts (1851, amended 1912)
All courts shall be open, and every person, for an injury done him in his land,
goods, person, or reputation, shall have remedy by due course of law, and shall
have justice administered without denial or delay.
[Suits against the state.] Suits may be brought against the state, in such
courts and in such manner, as may be provided by law.
   (As amended September 3, 1912.)"
and
   "§ 1.19b Property rights in ground water, lakes, and other watercourses
   [including but not limited to]
(E) Ground water underlying privately owned land and nonnavigable waters
located on or flowing through privately owned land shall not be held in trust
by any governmental body. The state, and a political subdivision to the extent
authorized by state law, may provide for the regulation of such waters. An
owner of land voluntarily may convey to a governmental body the owner's
property interest held in the ground water underlying the land or nonnavigable
waters located on or flowing through the land."
and
"§ 1.02 Right to alter, reform, or abolish government, and repeal special
privileges (1851)
All political power is inherent in the people. Government is instituted for
their equal protection and benefit, and they have the right to alter, reform,
or abolish the same, whenever they may deem it necessary; and no special
privileges or immunities shall ever be granted, that may not be altered,
revoked, or repealed by the general assembly."
IT IS FURTHER HEREBY PROCLAIMED BY THE HOME RULE MUNICIPALITY OF THE CITY OF
MANSFIELD AND FOR THE PROTECTION OF ITSELF AND ITS CITIZENS AND FUTURE
GENERATIONS, THAT EACH AND ALL SHALL POSSESS THE FOLLOWING INALIENABLE RIGHTS: 
(A) Right to Sustainable Water. All residents, natural communities and
ecosystems in the City of Mansfield possess a fundamental and inalienable right
to sustainably access, use, consume, and preserve water drawn from natural
water cycles that provide water necessary to sustain life within the City.
(B) Right to Clean Air. All residents, natural communities and ecosystems in
the City of Mansfield possess a fundamental and inalienable right to breathe
air untainted by toxins, carcinogens, particulates and other substances known
to cause harm to health.
(C) Right to Peaceful Enjoyment of Home. Residents of the City of Mansfield
possess a fundamental and inalienable right to the peaceful enjoyment of their
homes, free from interference, intrusion, nuisances or impediments to access
and occupation.
(D) Right to a Sustainable Energy Future. All residents in the City of
Mansfield possess a right to a sustainable energy future, which includes, but
is not limited to, the development, production, and use of energy from
renewable fuel sources, including, but not limited to, water and air.
(E) Right to Self-Government. All residents of the City of Mansfield possess
the fundamental and inalienable right to a form of governance where they live
which recognizes that all power is inherent in the people, that all free
governments are founded on the people's authority and consent, and that
corporate or other entities and their directors and managers shall not enjoy
special privileges or powers under the law which make municipal community
majorities subordinate to them.
(F) People as Sovereign. The City of Mansfield shall be the governing authority
responsible to, and governed by, the residents of the City. Use of the "City of
Mansfield" municipal corporation by the sovereign people of the City to make
law shall not be construed to limit or surrender the sovereign authority or
immunities of the people to a municipal corporation that is subordinate to them
in all respects at all times. The people at all times enjoy and retain an
inalienable and indefeasible right to self-governance in the community where
they reside.
(G) Rights as Self-Executing. All rights delineated and secured by this Charter
shall be self-executing and these rights shall be enforceable against
corporations and governmental entities.
(H) Securing and Protecting Rights. To further secure and protect the rights
enumerated by the aforementioned Bill of Rights:

   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except

construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.

   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   121.01  RULES OF COUNCIL.
   (a)    Meetings of Council.
      (1)    Rule A1. Regular and caucus meetings of Council.  Caucus meetings
of Council shall be held on the first and third Tuesday of each month at 7:00
p.m., to be followed by the regular meeting of Council except the month of July
when the regular and caucus meeting of Council on the first Tuesday will not be
held, and except the month of November when the regular and caucus meeting of
Council on the first Tuesday conflicts with Election Day, in which case the
meetings shall be held on the following Wednesday.
      (2)    Rule A2. Special meetings of Council.  The Mayor or any three
members of Council may call special meetings upon at least twelve hours notice
to each member, served personally or left at his usual place of residence.
      (3)    Rule A3.  Public meetings.  All regular and caucus meetings of
Council and meetings of its standing and special committees shall be held as
public meetings in strict accordance with Article XIII of the City.
      (4)    Rule A4.  Attendance by members of Council.  Members of Council
shall attend all meetings of Council as prescribed by Rule A1. Upon any member
of Council being absent from all regular meetings of Council for two
consecutive months, or four consecutive regular meetings, without valid excuse,
the Clerk of Council shall cause to be placed on the agenda of Council for its
next regular meeting a bill declaring the seat of such member to be vacant for
absence without valid excuse. The Clerk shall immediately notify in writing
such member that a bill under Rule A4 of Council will be considered at the next
regular meeting of Council declaring his seat vacant by reason of absence
without valid excuse and that such member will have the opportunity to be heard
at such regular meeting prior to consideration of the bill by Council. Such
bill may be enacted by Council but shall require the concurrence of two-thirds
of all members elected to Council for its adoption, and it shall not be subject
to the Mayor's veto. Council may impose a lesser penalty under this rule. For
the purpose of this rule a "regular meeting" of Council shall not include a
caucus meeting.
   (b)    Officers and Committees of Council.
      (1)    Rule B1.  President of Council.  The President of Council shall
preside at all Council meetings but shall have no vote, except in the case of a
tie. He shall see that all meetings are conducted in a proper, efficient, and
fair manner and should not speak on issues from the chair. He may, however,
relinquish the chair and speak on issues as any citizen may. The President of
Council is part of the executive branch of the City and as such helps provide
liaison between the executive and legislative branches.
      (2)    Rule B2. President Pro Tempore of Council.  A President Pro
Tempore is elected by Council within ten days of the commencement of their
term. He shall serve for two years but may be removed at any time for cause at
a regular meeting of Council by a two-thirds vote of members elected. The
President Pro Tempore serves as acting President of Council in the absence of
the elected President or when the elected President is serving as Acting Mayor.
In such a role the President Pro Tempore may vote in all matters coming before
Council, but he cannot vote again in the case of a tie. In the event that the
President of Council succeeds the Mayor of the City, the President Pro Tempore
becomes the President of Council and a new President Pro Tempore is elected.
      (3)    Rule B3.  Appointment of temporary chairman.  In the event of the
absence of both the President of Council and the President Pro Tempore, Council
shall elect by majority vote an acting chairman who shall perform the duties of
the President Pro Tempore.
      (4)    Rule B4.  Committees of Council.  Council shall establish by
resolution at the first regular meeting of their term such standing committees
as it deems necessary. Additional standing committees or special committees may
be established at any regular meeting by resolution of Council. The appointment
of members to either standing or special committees and the selection of
chairman and vice chairmen thereof shall be made by resolution of Council.
   (c)    Employees of Council.
      (1)    Rule C1. Clerk of Council.  The members of the majority political
party of Council shall designate the Clerk of Council who shall serve at their
pleasure. Council shall provide by resolution for the employment of the Clerk
indicating the name of person designated, compensation and such other
information as needed. The Clerk will attend all regular and special meetings
of Council, will manage the operation of the office of the Clerk of Council,
and will supervise the activities of the Assistant Clerk of Council.  The Clerk
will receive such fringe benefits, including vacations and insurance, as any
employee of the City serving in an equivalent position.
      (2)    Rule C2. Assistant Clerk of Council.  The members of the second
ranking political party of Council shall designate the Assistant Clerk of
Council who shall serve at their pleasure. Council shall provide by resolution
for the employment of the Assistant Clerk of Council indicating the name of the
person appointed, compensation and such other information as needed. The
Assistant Clerk of Council, while working with all members of Council, shall
work under the supervision of the Clerk of Council. In the event the Clerk of
Council is absent from work, the Assistant Clerk will perform all functions of
the Clerk including attending all regular and special meetings of Council.  The
Assistant Clerk of Council will receive such fringe benefits, including
vacation and insurance, as any employee of the City serving in an equivalent
position.
   (d)    General Conduct of Council Meetings.
      (1)    Rule D1. Quorum.  Five members of Council shall constitute a

      (4)   Rule D4.  Reading of journal, communications; dispensed with.  The
reading of the journal of the previous meeting and any communications or
petitions received are to be dispensed with unless a motion is made and passed
specifying that they be read. The presiding officer should state "Unless there
is an objection, the reading of the journal and correspondence is dispensed
with."  Any correspondence received is to be referred by the President to the
Rules Committee for determination of Committee assignment.
      (5)    Rule D5.  Obtaining privilege of floor by members.  For all
purposes, save that of seconding motions, no member shall be entitled to any of
the privileges of the floor until he addresses the presiding officer by proper
title, and is recognized by him. No member shall be privileged to disturb or
interrupt another member having the floor except by a call to order.
      (6)    Rule D6.  Taking of yeas and nays.  The yeas and nays shall be
taken on each question by electronic vote and thereafter entered upon the
journal. The final vote shall not be displayed by the presiding officer until
all votes have been registered.
      (7)    Rule D7.  Voting required.  Upon every call of the yeas and nays,
every member present shall vote; except if any member feels that he has a
personal interest in the matter, he may be excused by a two-thirds vote of the
members present.
   (e)    General Procedures for and Enactment of Legislation.
      (1)    Rule E1.  Preparation and distribution of legislation. No
legislation, except for informal resolutions of Council shall be read or
considered at any regular meeting of Council unless it has been made available
for discussion at the caucus meeting of a previous regular meeting of Council. 
The request for the preparation of such legislation shall have been filed in
the office of the Clerk of Council not later than 4:00 p.m. on the Monday of
the week preceding the date of the caucus meeting at which such legislation is
to be read and considered.  All requests directed to the Director of Law for
the preparation of legislation shall be submitted on the form prescribed by the
Director of Law and furnished by the Clerk of Council.  Copies of all such
requests will be furnished by the Clerk to the offices of the Mayor and
Director of Finance and one copy shall be retained for the information of
Council.
         The Clerk of Council shall cause copies of all legislation to be read
and considered at a regular meeting of Council to be available for distribution
to Council members not later than 12:00 noon on the Friday preceding the caucus
meeting at which such legislation is to be read and considered.
      (2)    Rule E2.  Reading of proposed ordinances and resolutions.  Every
proposed resolution and ordinance of a general and permanent nature shall be
first read for information on the day when introduced; and, unless Council
shall otherwise order, shall lie on the table until the next meeting of Council
when the same shall be read the second time. After the second reading, unless
Council shall otherwise order, the bill shall lie on the table until the next
meeting of Council when it shall be read the third time, and the final vote be
taken upon the question of the passage or adoption thereof. It shall be in
order at any time before final passage or adoption to amend the bill, refer it
to committee or take any other proper action. Each ordinance and resolution
shall be read by title only, provided Council may require the reading to be in
full by a majority vote of its members. This rule requiring three readings of
all ordinances and resolutions may be dispensed with by a single motion and an
affirmative vote by three-fourths of the members of the legislative authority
for all legislation coming before Council at any particular session.
      (3)   Rule E3.  Emergency ordinances and resolutions.  Emergency
ordinances and resolutions must set forth the reason for the emergency in one
section of the ordinance or resolution. Each emergency ordinance or resolution
shall require the affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of the members
elected to Council for its enactment; provided that if it fails to receive the
requisite two-thirds affirmative votes, but received the necessary majority for
passage as a non-emergency ordinance or resolution, it shall be considered
passed as such and shall become effective as provided in the case of a non-
emergency ordinance or resolution. Emergency ordinances and resolutions take
effect immediately upon the approval of the Mayor.
   (f)    Motions.
      (1)    Rule F1. Seconding of motions.  All motions, except for a call to
order, must be seconded before being placed on the floor. The presiding officer
shall restate the motion before entertaining debate or taking action.
      (2)    Rule F2. Motions that may be received during debate.  When a
question or proposition is before Council or under debate, or when a motion has
been made, no motions shall be received except the following:
         A.    To adjourn (undebatable)
         B.    To recess (undebatable)
         C.    To table the motion (i.e., to lay on the table) (undebatable)
         D.    To end debate (i.e., call for the previous question)
(undebatable)
         E.    To postpone to a definite time
         F.    To refer to committee
         G.    To amend
         H.    To postpone indefinitely
         These motions shall have precedence according to the above order.
      (3)    Rule F3. Motion to adjourn.  A motion to adjourn shall always be
in order, except upon immediate repetition thereof, or when a member has the
floor, or when Council is voting, and the same shall not be debatable.
      (4)    Rule F4. Motion to appeal.  An appeal may be made from any
decision of the presiding officer of Council, but it can be made only at the
time when the ruling is made. If this appeal is seconded the presiding officer
shall state clearly the question at issue and his reasons for the decision, if
he thinks it necessary, and then state the question thus: The question is
"shall the decision of the chair be sustained ?" If a majority votes aye, the
ruling of the presiding officer is sustained; otherwise, the presiding officer
is overruled.
      (5)    Rule F5.  Motion to withdraw a motion.  When a motion is before
Council and the mover wishes to withdraw it, if no one objects, the presiding
officer grants permission; if any objection is made, a formal motion to
withdraw must be made. When a motion is withdrawn, the effect is the same as if
it had never been made.
      (6)    Rule F6. Motion to lay on the table.  A motion to lay on the table
shall preclude all amendments or debate of the subject under consideration. If
the motion shall prevail, the consideration of the subject may be resumed only
upon a motion to remove from table made by a member voting with the majority
and with the consent of a majority of the members present.
      (7)    Rule F7. Motion to close debate.  When a motion is made and
seconded to close debate, or to call for the previous question, the presiding
officer shall put the question "Shall debate be closed?" If it fails, the
discussion continues as if this motion had not been made. If adopted, debate is
immediately closed, except the member who introduced the motion has the
privilege of ending debate, and the vote is taken upon the pending question
including voting upon any pending amendments or motion to refer.
      (8)    Rule F8. Motion to reconsider.  Any member who was absent or voted
with the prevailing side may move a reconsideration of any action of Council,
excepting measures which shall be in immediate effect. Such a motion for
reconsideration shall be made not later than the next regular meeting after the
action to which it relates was taken. No motion to reconsider shall be made
more than once on any measure, and such a motion shall require a majority of
all members elected to Council in order to prevail.
   (g)     Privilege of Floor by Persons Other Than Council Members.
      (1)    Rule G1. Privilege of floor by other Municipal officers.  The
Mayor, the Director of Law, the Director of Finance, the Service Director,
Safety Director, Public Works Director or their representatives shall be
entitled to any of the privileges of the floor for the purpose of speaking upon
any questions pertaining to their respective departments.
      (2)    Rule G2.  Privilege of floor granted to other persons.  Persons
not having the privilege of the floor by reason of their office shall  be
controlled by the following procedures:

open to the public.
         B.    Any person desiring to address Council is requested to notify

to speak, giving his name, address and subject. This notice of intent to speak
may also be given to the Clerk or presiding officer of Council immediately
prior to any meeting.

remarks.

necessary by reason of the number of the public intending to address Council.
         G.    No person shall be entitled to the floor a second time upon the
same subject at one meeting.
   (h)    Other Rules.

Council Chambers and the Council offices.

(Ord. 67-212.  Passed 8-1-67.)
   163.03  RENEWAL PLANS.
   A renewal plan shall conform to the general plan of the City and to any
general development plans for the district within which the renewal area lies,
and with the workable program of the City for the elimination and prevention of
slums and blight. A renewal plan shall include a description of the boundaries
of the renewal area and of any redevelopment, rehabilitation and conservation

deteriorated or deteriorating area.

opportunity consistent with the sound needs of the locality as a whole, for the
renewal of the project area by private enterprise, and

from the City to the redeveloper. Any such terms, conditions or covenants shall
not contain any restrictions based upon race, creed or color. Pending the use
or sale of property in a project area, the Director may temporarily rent such
property for such uses and purposes as may be desirable, even though not in
conformity with the renewal plan.

existing structure, when such repair is necessary to the immediate preservation
of the public health and safety, and providing further that such permit may be

plan.

authority thereof; provided, however, that such tax exemption shall terminate

   In addition to those duties specified in other sections of this chapter, the
MBE Officer and such other employees as are necessary shall implement and
enforce this chapter in accordance with the duties listed hereunder.  The
duties of the MBE Officer shall include, but not be limited to:
   (a)   Developing, monitoring implementation of and providing continuing
evaluation of the City's MBE/DBE Program;
   (b)   Reporting annually to Council on the MBE/DBE Program and recommending
changes as needed.  Reporting responsibility also includes compilation and
submission of reports required by federal agencies related to the MBE/DBE

23.49), and maintenance of accurate and up-to-date records demonstrating City
efforts and progress; with respect to its DBE/MBE goals as set forth in this
chapter.
   (c)   Reviewing all applications and other information supplied to determine
whether individual contractors have been certified or are certifiable as MBE's
and/or DBE's;
   (d)   Compiling and maintaining a directory identifying MBE's and DBE's by
name, address and other designations deemed appropriate by the MBE Officer. 
Each such business enterprise shall be classified in the directory as a MBE
and/or DBE.  The directory shall be updated at least annually and shall be made

   (e)   Assisting in securing management and technical assistance resources

   (f)   Publicizing business opportunities with the City suitable for MBE, WBE

funds provided by HUD, DOT and FAA;
   (g)   Assisting MBE's and DBE's in locating resources to aid in bidding on
City contracts and subcontracts by planning and/or participating in training
sessions, workshops, seminars, etc.  This assistance shall include pre-bid and
pre- construction meetings to explain MBE/DBE requirements;
   (h)   Monitoring the subcontracting practices of City contractors to ensure
continued compliance;
   (i)   Receiving and reviewing rules and regulations issued by the State of
Ohio or the Federal Government relevant to contract compliance, and assuring
that the City is conforming to those rules and regulations applicable to the
City; and
   (j)   Investigating complaints of discrimination against MBE's and DBE's by
City contractors.
      (Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.04  MBE ELIGIBILITY AND CERTIFICATION.
   (a)   Each business, including the MBE partner in a joint venture, wishing
to participate in City contracts as a MBE, shall complete and submit an MBE
application.  Each entity wishing to participate as a joint venture MBE shall
in addition complete and submit a MBE joint venture application.  The
application shall be signed by the authorized representative of the business
entity and shall be sworn to before a notary public.  A business seeking
certification as an MBE shall submit the required application with its bid.
   (b)   The MBE Officer shall apply the following standards in determining
whether a business enterprise qualifies for MBE status:
      (1)   Bona fide minority group membership shall be established on the
basis of the individual's claim that he or she is a member of a minority group
and is so regarded by that particular minority community.
      (2)   An eligible MBE under this part shall be an independent business. 
The ownership and control by minorities shall be real, substantial and
continuing and shall be beyond the pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected
in its ownership documents.  The minority owners shall enjoy the customary
incidents of ownership and shall share in the risks and profits commensurate
with their ownership interests, as demonstrated by an examination of the
substance rather than form of arrangements.  Recognition of the business as a
separate entity for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient for
recognition as a MBE.  In determining whether a potential MBE is an independent
business, the MBE Officer shall consider the date the business was established,
the adequacy of its resources for the work of the contract, and the degree to
which financial, equipment leasing and other relationships with non-minority
firms vary from industry practice.
      (3)   The minority owners shall also possess the power to direct or cause
the direction of the management and policies of the firm and to make the day-
to-day as well as major decisions on matters of management, policy and
operations.  The firm shall not be subject to any formal or informal
restrictions which limit the customary discretion of the minority.  There shall
be no restrictions through, for example, bylaw provisions, partnership
agreements or requirements in articles of incorporation for cumulative voting
rights or otherwise that prevent the minority owners, without the cooperation
or vote of any owner who is not a minority, from making a business decision of
the firm.
      (4)   If the owners of the firm who are not minorities are
disproportionately responsible for the operation of the firm, then the firm is
not controlled by minorities and shall not be considered an MBE within the
meaning of this chapter.  Where the actual management of the firm is contracted
out to individuals other than the owner, those persons who have the ultimate
power to hire and fire the managers can, for the purpose of this part, be
considered as controlling the business.
      (5)   All securities which constitute ownership and/or control of a
corporation for purposes of establishing it as an MBE under this part shall be
held directly by minorities.  No securities held in trust, or by any guardian
for a minor, shall be considered as held by a minority in determining the
ownership or control of a corporation.
      (6)   Newly formed firms and firms whose ownership and/or control has
changed since the date of the advertisement of the contract shall be reviewed
to determine the reasons for the timing of the formation of or change in the
firm.
      (7)   A previous and/or continuing employer-employee relationship between
or among present owners shall be reviewed to ensure that the employee-owner has
management responsibilities and capabilities discussed in this section.
      (8)   Any relationship between an MBE and a business which is not an MBE,
but which has an interest in the MBE, shall be reviewed to determine if the
interest of the non-MBE conflicts with the ownership and control requirements
of this section.
   (c)   A joint venture is eligible under this section if the MBE partner of
the joint venture meets the standards for an eligible MBE set forth above and
the MBE partner is responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work to be
performed and shares in the ownership, control, management responsibilities,
risks and profits of the joint venture.
   (d)   A business wishing to be certified as an MBE or joint venture MBE
shall provide such additional information to the City as the MBE Officer shall
request.
   (e)   If after review and applying the above standards, the MBE Officer
determines that applying business enterprise is a bona fide MBE, he shall
certify the business enterprise as an MBE firm and issue an MBE certification
number to the firm.  The certification shall be effective as long as the
information in the relevant MBE application continues to be true, but no longer
than for a period of twelve months.
   (f)   Once certified, an MBE shall update its MBE application annually.  If
at any time there is a change in ownership or control of the firm, the MBE
shall submit a new MBE application.
(Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.05  DBE ELIGIBILITY AND CERTIFICATION.
   (a)   Each business, including the DBE partner in a joint venture, wishing
to participate in City contracts as a DBE, shall complete and submit a DBE
application.  Each entity wishing to participate as a joint venture DBE shall
in addition complete and submit a DBE joint venture application.  The
applications shall be signed by the authorized representative of the business
entity and shall be sworn to before a notary public.  A business seeking
certification as a DBE shall submit the required application with its bid.
   (b)   The MBE Officer shall apply the following standards in determining
whether a business enterprise qualifies for DBE status:
      (1)   Bona fide minority group membership, including women, shall be
established on the basis of the individual's claim that he or she is a member
of a minority group and is so regarded by that particular minority community.
      (2)   An eligible DBE under this part shall be an independent business
and shall be a small business concern.  The ownership and control by
disadvantaged individuals shall be real, substantial and continuing and shall
go beyond the pro forma ownership of the firm as reflected in its ownership
documents.  The disadvantaged individuals shall enjoy the customary incidents
of ownership and shall share in the risks and profits commensurate with their
ownership interests, as demonstrated by an examination of the substance rather
than form of arrangements.  Recognition of the business as a separate entity
for tax or corporate purposes is not necessarily sufficient for recognition as
a DBE.  In determining whether a potential DBE is an independent business, the
MBE Officer shall consider the date the business was established, the adequacy
of its resources for the work of the contract and the degree to which
financial, equipment leasing and other relationships with non-disadvantaged
individual firms vary from industry practice.
      (3)   The disadvantaged individuals who are owners shall also possess the
power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of the
firm and to make the day-to-day as well as major decisions on matters of
management, policy and operations.  The firm shall not be subject to any formal
or informal restrictions which limit the customary discretion of the
disadvantaged individual.  There shall be no restrictions through, for example,
bylaw provisions, partnership agreements or requirements of the articles of
incorporation for cumulative voting rights or otherwise that prevent
disadvantaged individuals, without the cooperation or vote of any owner who is
not a disadvantaged individual, from making a business decision of the firm.
      (4)   If the owners of the firm who are not disadvantaged individuals are
disproportionately responsible for the operation of the firm, then the firm is
not controlled by disadvantaged individuals and shall not be considered a DBE
within the meaning of this chapter.  Where the actual management of the firm is
contracted out to individuals, other than the owner, those persons who have the
ultimate power to hire and fire the managers can, for the purpose of this part,
be considered as controlling the business.
      (5)   All securities which constitute ownership and/or control of a
corporation for purposes of establishing it as a DBE under this part shall be
held directly by disadvantaged individuals.  No securities held in trust, or by
any guardian for a minor, shall be considered as held by a disadvantaged
individual in determining the ownership or control of a corporation.
      (6)   The contributions of capital or expertise by the disadvantaged
individual owners to acquire their interests in the firm shall be real and
substantial.  Examples of insufficient contributions include a promise to
contribute capital, a note payable to the firm or its owners who are not
socially and economically disadvantaged, or the mere participation as an
employee, rather than as a manager.
      (7)   Newly formed firms and firms whose ownership and/or control has
changed since the date of the advertisement of the contract shall be reviewed
to determine the reasons for the timing of the formation of or change in the
firm.
      (8)   A previous and/or continuing employer-employee relationship between
or among present owners shall be reviewed to ensure that the employee-owner has
management responsibilities and capabilities discussed in this section.
      (9)   Any relationship between a DBE and a business which is not a DBE
which has an interest in the DBE shall be reviewed to determine if the interest
of the non-DBE conflicts with the ownership and control requirements of this
section.
   (c)   A joint venture is eligible under this section if the DBE partner of
the joint venture meets the standards for an eligible DBE set forth above and
the DBE partner is responsible for a clearly defined portion of the work to be
performed and shares in the ownership, control, management responsibilities,
risks and profits of the joint venture.
   (d)   A business wishing to be certified as a DBE or joint venture DBE shall
provide such additional information to the City as the MBE Officer requests.
   (e)   If, after review, the MBE Officer determines that the applying
business enterprise is a bona fide DBE, he shall certify the business
enterprise as a DBE firm and issue a DBE certification number to the firm.  The
certification shall be effective as long as the information in the relevant DBE
application continues to be true, but no longer than for a period of twelve
months.
   (f)   Once certified, a DBE shall update its DBE application annually.  If
at any time there is a change in ownership or control of the firm, the DBE
shall submit a new DBE application.
(Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.06  REQUIRED STEPS IN EVALUATING MBE AND DBE APPLICATIONS.
   The MBE Officer shall take the following steps in evaluating each MBE
application:
   (a)   Perform an on-site visit to the offices of the applicant firm and to
any job sites on which the applicant firm is working at the time of the
eligibility investigation;
   (b)   Obtain the resumes or work histories of the principal owners of the
applicant firm and personally interview such individuals;
   (c)   Analyze the ownership of stock in the applicant firm, if it is a
corporation;
   (d)   Analyze the bonding and financial capacity of the applicant firm;
   (e)   Determine the work history of the applicant firm, including contracts
it has received and work it has completed;
   (f)   Obtain or compile a list of equipment owned or available to the
applicant firm and the licenses of the firm and its key personnel to perform
the work it seeks to do in participating in the MBE or DBE Program;
   (g)   Obtain a statement from the applicant firm of the type of work it
prefers to perform as part of the MBE or DBE Program; and
   (h)   Perform such additional investigation as the MBE Officer deems
necessary to thoroughly and fairly evaluate each MBE application.
      (Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.07  CONTRACTING GOALS.
   (a)   Goals shall be established for MBE and DBE participation in contracts
awarded by the City, the following three areas:
      MBE participation in contracts funded by HUD;
      DBE participation in contracts funded by DOT and FAA;
      MBE participation in contracts financed with City funds.
   When a project is wholly financed with City funds, MBE participation goals
may be satisfied either by meeting the MBE percentage referred to above or by
the general contractor employing a same or greater percentage of minority
workers on the project.
   When a project has state or federal funding, a pre-set minority requirement
included in the grant agreement shall supersede the City's goal.
   Each goal shall be set on a percentage basis and the percentage shall be
determined initially within sixty days after the effective date of this section
and yearly thereafter by the Minority Contracting Goals Committee which is
hereby established consisting of the following:
      (1)   Mayor.
      (2)   City Engineer.
      (3)   Director of Public Works.
      (4)   Service Safety Director.
      (5)   Manager of Community Development.
      (6)   Two members from Council, one of whom shall be the chairman of the
Public Affairs Committee and the other shall be appointed every two years by
Council from its membership.
      (7)   MBE Officer.
   (b)   The Committee shall consider the known availability of qualified MBE's
and DBE's in establishing each goal.
   (c)   Each contractor who is awarded a contract funded by HUD, DOT or FAA
shall use its best efforts to meet the goal established by the City for the
contract awarded.
   (d)   Contractors shall, at a minimum, seek MBE's in the Richland County
area.  If the contractor cannot meet the goals using MBE's from this geographic
area, the contractor, as part of its efforts to meet the goal, can expand its
search to a reasonable wider geographic area, or under City funded dollars the
workforce approach can be used.
   (e)   Bidders, submitting a bid for any contract shall disclose to the MBE
Officer, in writing, the names and addresses of each DBE and MBE firm that will
participate in the contract, if awarded to the bidder, a description of the
work each named MBE or DBE will perform, and the dollar amount of participation
in the contract by each named MBE or DBE.  Such disclosure shall be made to the
MBE Officer prior to award of the contract.
   (f)   Contractors shall make good faith efforts to replace an MBE
subcontractor that is unable to perform successfully with another MBE and
replace a DBE subcontractor that is unable to perform successfully with another
DBE.
   (g)   Requests for bids published by the City in connection with projects
funded by HUD, DOT and FAA shall inform potential bidders of the information
which must be submitted to demonstrate their ability to comply with MBE/DBE
requirements of the City.
   (h)   The City MBE Officer shall have discretion to decide whether each
contractor has exercised its best efforts to meet its MBE/DBE contract goal. 
In deciding whether a contractor has exercised its best efforts, the City MBE
Officer shall consider the following:
      (1)   If a pre-solicitation and/or pre-bid meeting is held whether the
contractor attended any meetings that were scheduled to inform DBE's and MBE's
of contracting and subcontracting opportunities;
      (2)   Whether the contractor advertised in general circulation, trade
association and minority-focus media, as available, concerning the
subcontracting opportunities;
      (3)   Whether the contractor provided written notice to a reasonable
number of specific DBE's and MBE's enabling the DBE's or MBE's to participate
effectively;
      (4)   Whether the contractor followed initial solicitations of interest
by contacting MBE's to determine with certainty whether the DBE's and MBE's
were interested;
      (5)   Whether the contractor selected portions of the work to be
performed by DBE's and MBE's in order to increase the likelihood of meeting the
DBE and MBE goals (including, where appropriate, breaking down contracts into
economically feasible units to facilitate DBE and MBE participation);
      (6)   Whether the contractor provided interested DBE's and MBE's with
adequate information about the plans, specifications and requirements of the
contract;
      (7)   Whether the contractor negotiated in good faith with interested
DBE's and MBE's, not rejecting DBE's and MBE's as unqualified without sound
reasons based on a thorough investigation of their capabilities;
      (8)   Whether the contractor effectively used the services of available
minority community organizations; minority contractors' groups; local, state
and federal minority business assistance offices; and other organizations that
provide assistance in the recruitment and placement of DBE's and MBE's; and
      (9)   Whether the contractor has provided documents and information which
the MBE Officer has requested the contractor to provide to the City.
   The general contractor has an obligation to contract with qualifying
minority contractors and vendors in the Richland County area.  In the event no
minority contractors or vendors are available in its scope of work or services,
and the general contractor has documented that they have exhausted all means
possible to contact qualified MBE's or DBE's in the Richland County area,
depending on the funding, the contractor then can request a waiver from the MBE
Officer.
   (i)   If the MBE Officer decides that a contract awardee has not exercised
good faith to meet the contractor's individual contract goal, the MBE Officer
shall recommend to the City Board of Control that the award of contract to such
contractor be revoked.
(Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.08  COUNTING MBE/DBE PARTICIPATION.
   (a)   MBE participation shall be counted toward meeting MBE goals set in
accordance with this chapter as follows:
      (1)   Once a firm is determined to be an eligible MBE, in accordance with
this chapter, the total dollar value of the contract or subcontract awarded to
the MBE is counted toward the applicable MBE goals.
      (2)   A contractor may count toward its MBE goals the following
expenditures to MBE firms that are not manufacturers or regular dealers:
         A.   The fees or commissions charged for providing a bona fide
service, such as professional, technical, consultant or managerial services and
assistance in the procurement of essential personnel, facilities, equipment,
materials or supplies required for performance of the contract, provided that
the fee or commission is determined by the recipient to be reasonable and not
excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.
         B.   The fees charged for delivery of materials and supplies required
on a job site (but not the cost of the materials and supplies themselves) when
the hauler, trucker or delivery service is not also the manufacturer of or a
regular dealer in the materials and supplies, provided that the fee is
determined by the recipient to be reasonable and not excessive as compared with
fees customarily allowed for similar services.
            The fees or commissions charged for providing any bonds or
insurance specifically required for the performance of the contract, provided
that the fee or commission is determined by the recipient to be reasonable and
not excessive as compared with fees customarily allowed for similar services.
   (b)   DBE participation shall be counted toward meeting DBE goals set in
accordance with this chapter as follows:
      (1)   Once a firm is determined to be an eligible DBE in accordance with
this chapter, the total dollar value of the contract or subcontract awarded to
the DBE is counted toward the applicable DBE goals.
      (2)   A contractor may count toward its DBE goals only expenditures to
DBE's that perform a commercially useful function in the work of a contract.  A
DBE is considered to perform a commercially useful function when it is
responsible for execution of a distinct element of the work of a contract and
carrying out its responsibilities by actually performing, managing and
supervising the work involved.  To determine whether a DBE is performing a
commercially useful function, the MBE Officer shall evaluate the amount of work
subcontracted, industry practices and other relevant factors.
         (Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.09  NONDISCRIMINATION BY CONTRACTORS.
   (a)   The goals hereof are established to encourage affirmative action by
all parties who participate in contracts with the City and apply to all
contractors and subcontractors.
   (b)   No contractor shall discriminate against any employee or applicant for
employment because of race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age,
handicap, ancestry or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status.  Contractors
shall take such affirmative action as is required by law to ensure that
applicants are employed and that employees are treated during employment
without regard to race, religion, color, sex, national origin, age, handicap,
ancestry or Vietnam-era or disabled veteran status.  As used herein, "treated"
means without limitation the following:  recruited whether by advertising or
other means; compensated, whether in the form of rates of pay or other forms of
compensation; selected for training, including apprenticeship, promoted,
upgraded, demoted, transferred, laid off and terminated.  Contractors shall
post in conspicuous places, available to employees and applicants for
employment, notices to be provided by the hiring representatives of the
contractors setting forth the provisions of this nondiscrimination clause.
(Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.10  MISREPRESENTATION OR FALSIFICATION.
   (a)   Any person who intentionally misrepresents himself/herself as owning,
controlling, operating or participating in an MBE or DBE for the purpose of
obtaining contracts, subcontracts or any other benefits under this chapter
shall be guilty of theft by deception as provided in Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or in a
substantially similar provision in the Codified Ordinances of the City.
   (b)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement, representation or
certification in any application, record, report, plan or other document filed
or required to be maintained pursuant to this chapter, or knowingly swear or
affirm the truth of a false statement previously made, or make such a
falsification with purpose to mislead a public official in performing his
official function.  Whoever violates this subsection is guilty of a misdemeanor
of the fourth degree on a first offense; on each subsequent offense such person
is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.  (Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.11  TIME REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURE FOR NONCOMPLIANCE.
   (a)   Whenever the MBE Officer determines a contractor to be in violation of
a provision of this chapter, he/she shall issue a written finding setting forth
such determination and the basis of his decision, together with notice to the
contractor of the right to object to the finding.  Such written finding shall
be served upon the contractor by certified mail at such contractor's last known
address or by hand delivery.  Any contractor taking exception to a finding of
the MBE Officer first shall attempt, within seven working days, to reconcile
the situation with the MBE Officer.  A good faith attempt to achieve informal
reconciliation is a prerequisite to the contractor filing a written objection
with the City's MBE Officer.
   (b)   If, after attempting to reconcile the violation by informal means, the
situation is not alleviated, within seven working days, a contractor may file a
written objection with the City's Public Works Director.  Thereupon, the MBE
Officer shall, within seven days, forward to the City's Public Works Director
all materials relating to the determination which is appealed, together with
recommendations of appropriate remedial action to be taken.
   (c)   If the MBE Officer finds a contractor to be in violation of this
chapter and no reconciliation is attempted by the contractor within fifteen
days of the receipt by the contractor of the written finding, the MBE Officer
shall forthwith forward his finding to the City's Public Works Director along
with any recommendation of appropriate remedial action to be taken.
   (d)   Under the direction of and upon authorization from the City, the MBE
Officer shall determine when a violation of this section exists and when the
attempts at reconciliation taken by the contractor will not reasonably
alleviate the situation.
(Ord. 93-001.  Passed 1-5-93.)
   173.12  ENFORCEMENT.
   Whenever the MBE Officer is satisfied that a contractor is in violation of
the provisions of this chapter, he may serve a written notice upon the violator
which notice shall contain a brief and concise statement of the violation and
shall order correction of the condition that is in violation, within ten days
of such extended time as such officer may determine to be appropriate.
   The notice shall also advise the contractor or other responsible person that
the order may be appealed under the provisions of this chapter or any
applicable appeal provision of the Ohio Revised Code.
   Service of the notice shall be made by certified mail or personally upon the
contractor or the person responsible on the contractor's behalf.  Service shall
be considered made upon date of mailing.
   Any contractor or other responsible person aggrieved by an order issued
pursuant to provisions of this chapter may appeal such order to the City's

      (2)   On income from all lottery, gambling, and sports winnings, and
games of chance received by resident individuals of the City of Mansfield.
         A.   If taxpayer is considered a professional gambler under the
Internal Revenue Code, then deductions for gambling losses shall be permitted
according to the Internal Revenue Code for a professional gambler.
B.   If taxpayer is not considered a professional gambler under the Internal
Revenue Code, a deduction equal to the amount of up to $2,500 of income
combined from lottery gambling and sports winnings, and games of chance, or a

   (b)   On all salaries, qualifying wages, third party sick pay, commissions

      (1)   In the taxation of income which is subject to municipal income
taxes, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession both within and without the boundaries of a municipal corporation
shall separately disclose with reasonable accuracy what portion of its net
profit  is attributable to that part of the business or profession conducted
within the boundaries of the municipal corporation, then only such portion
shall be considered as having a taxable situs in such municipal corporation for
purposes of municipal income taxation. In the absence of such records, net
profits from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of a municipal corporation shall be considered as having a taxable
status in such municipal corporation for purposes of municipal income taxation
in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.   The average original cost of property of the real and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in such municipal corporation during the taxable period to the average net book
value of all the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the
taxpayer in business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, real property shall include
property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such property shall
be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.   Wages, salaries, third party sick pay, commissions and other
compensation paid during the taxable period to persons employed in the business
or profession for services performed in such municipal corporation to wages,
salaries, third party sick pay and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the profession, wherever their services are
performed.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in such municipal corporation to
gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales
and services wherever made or performed. In the event that the foregoing
allocation formula does not produce an equitable result, another basis may,
under uniform regulations, be substituted so as to produce such results.
      (2)   As used in subsection (h)(1) hereof, "sales made in a municipal
corporation" means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes if shipped or
delivered from a stock of goods within such municipal corporation.
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
such municipal corporation regardless of where title passes even though
transported from a point outside such municipal corporation if the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within such municipal corporation to purchasers outside such municipal
corporation regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through
its own employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales
at the place where delivery is made.
   (i)    In the computation of any tax due under this chapter, a business loss
of a previous tax year shall not be allowed or carried forward to reduce the
tax due in any subsequent tax year.
   (j)   In the event a just and equitable result cannot be obtained under the
formula provided for herein, the Finance Director, upon application of the
taxpayer, shall have the authority to substitute other factors or methods
calculated to effect a fair and proper apportionment.

shall, on or before April 15, 1989, and on or before April 15 of each year
thereafter, make and file an annual return with the Finance Director on a form
obtainable from the Director, setting forth the aggregate amount of salary,
wages, third party sick pay or other compensation and net profits earned by him
during the preceding year or period, whether a tax be due thereon or not,
together with W-2, federal schedules and other pertinent information as the
Director may require. Provided, however, that when the annual return is made
for a fiscal year or other period different from the calendar year, the return
shall be made within 105 days from the end of such fiscal year or other period.
If such resident is retired and has no earned income, he shall register with
the Director as a retired resident; therefore, annual returns shall not be
expected. Thereafter, a resident registered as retired shall update his status
if he receives taxable income per this chapter.
   (b)    Each nonresident of the City earning wages, salary, commissions,
third party sick pay or other taxable income under Section
191.02 shall file a tax return according to the provisions of subsection (a)
hereof disclosing only those moneys earned within the City. However, the return
of an employer showing the amount of tax deducted by such employer or employers
from the salaries, wages, third party sick pay, commissions or compensation of
any employee, and paid by him or them to the Director shall be accepted as the
return required of any such employee whose sole income subject to the City
income tax herein, is such salaries, wages, third party sick pay, commissions
or other compensation.
   (c)    The returns required by subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall also
show the amount of the tax imposed on such earnings and profits. The taxpayer
making the return shall, at the time of the filing thereof, pay to the Director
the amount of taxes shown as due thereon. Provided, however, that where any
portion of such tax is by such taxpayer pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.05 and/or Section
191.06, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the annual return.
   (d)    Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of a City income tax
return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal extension request with the
City Income Tax Division.  Any taxpayer not required to file a federal income
tax return may request an extension for filing a municipal income tax return in
writing.  The request for extension must be filed on or before the original due
date for the annual return.  If the request is granted, the extended due date
of the City income tax return shall be the last day of the month following the
month to which the due date of the federal income tax return has been extended.
   (e)    A tax in the amount of three dollars ($3.00) or less shall not be
collected or refunded, provided that this subsection is not applicable to taxes
collected at the source under the provisions of Section
191.05, and provided further that nothing in the subsection dispenses with any
requirement of this chapter relating to the filing of declarations, returns and
questionnaires.
   (f)    Commencing with taxable years beginning subsequent to December 31,
1994 the net loss from an unincorporated business activity may not be used to
offset salaries, wages, commissions or other compensation. However, if a
taxpayer is engaged in two or more taxable business activities to be included
in the same return, the net loss of one unincorporated business activity
(except any portion of a loss separately reportable for municipal tax purposes
to another taxing entity) may be used to offset the profits of another for
purposes of arriving at overall net profits.
   (g)    If a net operating loss has been sustained in any taxable year such
losses may not be carried forward or backward to any other taxable year.
   (h)    Affiliated corporations may not deduct a loss from any other
corporation having a taxable profit and operations of any affiliated
corporation having a loss may not be taken into consideration in computing net
profits or business allocation percentage formula.
   Within thirty days of receiving a tax refund from another municipality for
which credit has been claimed on a taxpayer's City return, as permitted by
Section
191.07 such taxpayer shall  make and file an amended City return and pay any
additional tax shown thereon.
(Ord. 04-253. Passed 12-21-04.)
   191.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   Each employer who employs within the City one or more persons on a salary,
wage, commission, third party sick pay or other compensation basis, excluding
exempted incomes set forth in Section
191.14, shall deduct at the time of the payment of such salary, wage,
commission, third party sick pay or other compensation, the tax on the
qualifying wages due by such employer to each such employee and shall make a
return and pay to the Finance Director the amount of taxes so deducted as
follows:
   (a)   In monthly payments to be made not later than ten days following the
last day of each month during which tax has been withheld or required to be
withheld, or
   (b)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the City during the
measurement period are less than $100 per month, payments may be made quarterly
on or before the last day of the month following the end of each quarter,
subject to the approval of the Finance Director.  The Finance Director may
revoke the approval of quarterly filing and payments whenever the Finance
Director has reason to believe that the conditions for granting such
authorization have changed, were judged incorrectly, were not met, or when it
is in the best interest of the City to do so.  Notice of withdrawal shall be
made in writing, and, in such case, the employer must begin to file in
accordance with this section.
   (c)   Upon the determination and finding by the Director that monthly or
quarterly payments would result in a delay that might jeopardize collection of
tax withheld, he may order that payment of the tax be made weekly, and such
payment shall be made within seven days following the close of the period for
which the jeopardy payment is made.  Such an order shall be delivered to the
taxpayer personally or by certified mail and remains in effect until the
Director notifies the employer to the contrary.
   (d)   Each employer shall file a withholding tax reconciliation showing the
sum total of all compensation paid all employees, the portion of which, (if
any) was not subject to withholding along with an explanation for same, and the
portion of which was subject to withholding, together with the amount of such
withholdings remitted.  Such return shall include information concerning each
employee from whom the City tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip
code and social security number of each such employee, the total amount of
compensation paid during the year and the amount of City tax withheld.  If the
total tax withheld from any employee’s wages, includes tax withheld and
remitted to another municipality, the amount of that withheld tax shall be
separately shown on the return of information to the City concerning each
employee.  The withholding tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer
on or before February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (e)   In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc.
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the City when the services were performed in the
City.  The information may be submitted on a listing, and shall include the
name, address, and social security number (or federal identification number),
and the amount of the payment made.  Federal form(s) 1099 may be submitted in
lieu of such listing.  The information shall be filed annually on or before
February 28 following the end of such calendar year.
   (f)   Employers having 100 or more employee records, as mentioned in this
section are required to submit the required information on magnetic media. 
Such filing must be done on a format provided by the City.  A penalty of $50
per day, after due date, will be assessed for noncompliance.
   Such return shall be on a form prescribed and furnished by the Director. 
Such employer, in collecting the tax, shall be deemed to hold the same as
trustee for the benefit of the City until payment is made by such employer to
the City and any such tax collected by the employer from his employees shall,
until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer.
   The officer or employee having control or supervision of or charged with the
responsibility of filing the report and making payment, is personally liable
for failure to file the report or pay the tax due as required by this chapter. 
The dissolution of a corporation does not discharge an officer’s or employee’s
liability for a prior failure of the corporation to file returns or pay tax
due.

(Ord. 95-251. Passed 12-19-95.)

Code, unless a different meaning is clearly required. If a term used in this
chapter that is not otherwise defined in this chapter is used in a comparable
context in both the laws of the United States relating to federal income tax
and in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised Code and the use is not consistent, then
the use of the term in the laws of the United States relating to federal income
tax shall control over the use of the term in Title LVII of the Ohio Revised
Code.
   For purposes of this Section, the singular shall include the plural, and the
masculine shall include the feminine and the gender-neutral.

under division  (1)(A) of this section, but excluding that portion of

carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years following the
taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for more years than

Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
193.052  of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)    In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

required to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) or (B)(1)(c) of this section
of taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to
the Tax Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the
end of each calendar quarter.
         (b)    Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the

hundred dollars. Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.

semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar
year exceeded one thousand dollars.  The payment under division (B)(1)(c) of

deducted and withheld during the first fifteen days of a month, the third
banking day after the fifteenth day of that month;

deducted and withheld after the fifteenth day of a month and before the first

day of that month.
         (d)    An employer, agent of an employer or other payer is required to
make payment by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of all taxes
deducted and withheld on behalf of the employee for remittance to the
Municipality if the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation. The
payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect
an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as
required under this section.  Once the threshold for remitting payment
electronically for federal purposes has been met, any accrued municipal income
tax withheld from employee qualifying wages earned within the Municipality
shall be remitted to the Municipality at the same time that the federal tax
withholding payment is due.
   (C)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section
193.091 of this Chapter,
   (D)    An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying

disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)    An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)    The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal

   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first

municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's

corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
193.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of section

   (G)    In the case of a person performing personal services at a petroleum
refinery located in a municipal corporation that imposes a tax on income, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on the qualifying
wages of such a person if the person performs those services on twelve or fewer
days in a calendar year, unless the principal place of work of the employer is
located in another municipal corporation in this state that imposes a tax
applying to compensation paid to the person for services performed on those
days and the person is not liable to that other municipal corporation for tax
on the compensation paid for such services. For the purposes of this division,
a petroleum refinery is a facility with a standard industrial classification

corporation for the first twelve days for which the employer paid qualifying
wages to the individual and for all subsequent days in the calendar year on

      (3)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a casino
operator shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom
an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.
The information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax
deducted from the person's winnings during the preceding year. The casino
operator shall provide to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
      (4)   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the amounts
deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.
      (5)   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall
deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person's prize award at the
rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the video lottery
terminal facility is located.
   (E)    Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are held
in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
      (1)   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person's name, address, and social security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
      (2)   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and social security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)    Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video
lottery sales agent shall issue an information return to each person with
respect to whom an amount has been deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The information return shall show the total amount of municipal
income tax deducted and withheld from the person's prize award by the video
lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
      (1)   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to fifty per cent of the tax
deducted and withheld;
      (2)   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or annual
return, a penalty of five hundred dollars for each return not filed or filed
late. Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and withheld at the
rate prescribed in section 5703.47 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (I)    Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
section
193.07 of this Chapter. This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld. 
   (J)    The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts and
returns required under this section.

Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
193.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
193.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section
193.03(11) of this Chapter.
      (3)   "Apportionment" means the apportionment as determined by Section

APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or profession in
the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under section
193.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
193.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)    A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
193.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:

         (b)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in

customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated. For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal

following criteria:
         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
   (F)   (1)   Except as provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
193.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
193.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. 
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
   (H)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
         (a)   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election period in

period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from

"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
193.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
193.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
193.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
193.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
193.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is

an affiliated group.

into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may

election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1,

on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the
cover in which the payment is mailed or, if the payment is made by electronic

liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   A taxpayer may amend a declaration under rules prescribed by the
Tax Administrator.  When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid
balance shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal
installments on or before the remaining payment dates.  The amended declaration
must be filed on the next applicable due date as outlined in (C)(1)(a) through
(d) of this section.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of the year
following that for which the declaration or amended declaration was filed, an
annual return shall be filed and any balance which may be due shall be paid
with the return in accordance with section
193.091 of this Chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return

extended pursuant to division (G) of section 5747.08 of the Revised Code.
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to section 193.10 of
this Chapter  upon  the  amount  of  underpayment  for  the  period  of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         (a)   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment;
         (c)   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by
the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed
for that payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least ninety
per cent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with
the municipal corporation under Section
193.091 of this Chapter for that year.
      (3)   The  taxpayer  is  an  individual  who  resides  in  the
Municipality  but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the
calendar year that includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.  (Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)

compensation. for work done, or services rendered outside of said City, if it
be made to appear that he has paid a municipal income tax on such net profits,
salary, wages, third party sick pay, commissions or other compensation to
another municipality, shall be allowed a credit on the tax imposed by this
chapter of the amount so paid by him or on his behalf to such other
municipality. The credit shall not exceed one percent (1%) on such net profit,
salary, wages, third party sick pay, commission or compensation earned in such
other municipality or municipalities where such tax is paid. Provided: The
credits established by this section shall be allowable to a taxpayer only to
the same extent that such other municipality or municipalities grant reciprocal

party sick pay, commissions or other personal service compensation, for work
done or services performed or rendered outside of such other municipality or
municipalities.
   (B)   Earnings of mentally handicapped and developmentally disabled

   193.082 REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)    The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
         (Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
   193.083 CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC  DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under section 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
section 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 of the Ohio Revised Code to the same extent
that it grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are
employed in another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
193.081 of this Chapter.
(Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
   193.084 CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (A)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
193.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in section
193.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
 193.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
193.081 of this Chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail. 
(Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)

individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section

file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality, regardless of

person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person

contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
   (E)    No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.

      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator

individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date

         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net

that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and

Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
193.092  of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
193.092  of this Chapter, the provision in Section
193.092  of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)    For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a

or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)     If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment is considered to be made when the payment shall be
considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by the first
electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section 193.051 of this Chapter
shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits against
payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld were
not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the employer,
agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts
withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
 193.052  of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
      (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
      (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly explains
the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous worksite
location and the last date on which the person performed services or made any
sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall include the
following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any services within
the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal corporation, or
otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered
a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with the municipal
corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal corporation's
resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the affidavit under
penalty of perjury.
      (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in section
193.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the

forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within

documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer  whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
193.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section

the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to

certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of section
193.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
   193.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
   193.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members. The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality.  Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
   193.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
193.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
193.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.   
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
193.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
193.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
            
   193.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Ohio Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator, to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on
the internet.
(Ord. 15-237.  Passed 11-17-15.)
   193.80  FILING NET PROFIT TAXES; ELECTION TO BE SUBJECT TO PROVISIONS OF
CHAPTER.
   (A)    A taxpayer may elect to be subject to sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances in lieu of the provisions set forth in the
remainder of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter,
upon the taxpayer's election, both of the following shall apply:
      (1)    The state tax commissioner shall serve as the sole administrator
of the municipal net profit tax for which the taxpayer as defined in
193.81 (C) of the Codified Ordinances is liable for the term of the election;
      (2)    The commissioner shall administer the tax pursuant to sections
718.80 to 718.95 of the Revised Code, sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, and any applicable provision of Chapter
5703 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer shall make the initial election on or before the
first day of the third month after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year
by notifying the tax commissioner and the City, on a form prescribed by the tax
commissioner.
      (2)   (a)    The election, once made by the taxpayer, applies to the
taxable year in which the election is made and to each subsequent taxable year
until the taxpayer notifies the tax commissioner and the City of its
termination of the election.
         (b)    A notification of termination shall be made, on a form
prescribed by the tax commissioner, on or before the first day of the third
month of any taxable year.
         (c)    Upon a timely and valid termination of the election, the
taxpayer is no longer subject to sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, and is instead subject to the provisions
set forth in the remainder of this chapter.
   (C)    The tax commissioner shall enforce and administer sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances. In addition to any other powers conferred
upon the tax commissioner by law, the tax commissioner may:
      (1)    Prescribe all forms necessary to administer those sections;
      (2)    Adopt such rules as the tax commissioner finds necessary to carry
out those sections;
      (3)    Appoint and employ such personnel as are necessary to carry out
the duties imposed upon the tax commissioner by those sections.
   (D)    The tax commissioner shall not be considered a tax administrator, as
that term is defined in section 718.01 of the Revised Code and Section
193.03  of the City Codified Ordinances.  (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.81  DEFINITIONS.
   If a term used in sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances that is not otherwise defined in this
chapter is used in a comparable context in both the laws of the United States
relating to federal income tax and in Title LVII of the Revised Code and the
use is not consistent, then the use of the term in the laws of the United
States relating to federal income tax shall have control over the use of the
term in Title LVII of the Revised Code, unless the term is defined in Chapter
5703. of the Revised Code, in which case the definition in that chapter shall
control. Any reference in this chapter to the Internal Revenue Code includes
other laws of the United States related to federal income taxes. If a term is
defined in both this section and section 193.03 of the Codified Ordinances, the
definition in this section shall control for all uses of that term in sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances.
   As used in sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances only:
   (A)    "Municipal taxable income" means income apportioned or sitused to the
municipal corporation under section
193.03  of the Codified Ordinances, as applicable, reduced by any pre-2017 net
operating loss carryforward available to the person for the municipal
corporation.
   (B)    "Adjusted federal taxable income," for a person required to file as a
C corporation, or for a person that has elected to be taxed as a C corporation
as described in division (D)(5) of section 718.01 of the Revised Code and
section
193.03  of the Codified Ordinances, means a C corporation's federal taxable
income before net operating losses and special deductions as determined under
the Internal Revenue Code, adjusted as follows:
      (1)    Deduct intangible income to the extent included in federal taxable
income. The deduction shall be allowed regardless of whether the intangible
income relates to assets used in a trade or business or assets held for the
production of income.
      (2)    Add an amount equal to five per cent of intangible income deducted
under division (B)(1) of this section, but excluding that portion of intangible
income directly related to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of property
described in section 1221 of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    Add any losses allowed as a deduction in the computation of
federal taxable income if the losses directly relate to the sale, exchange, or
other disposition of an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal
Revenue Code.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (B)(4)(b) of this section,
deduct income and gain included in federal taxable income to the extent the
income and gain directly relate to the sale, exchange, or other disposition of
an asset described in section 1221 or 1231 of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    Division (B)(4)(a) of this section does not apply to the extent
the income or gain is income or gain described in section 1245 or 1250 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (5)    Add taxes on or measured by net income allowed as a deduction in
the computation of federal taxable income.
      (6)    In the case of a real estate investment trust or regulated
investment company, add all amounts with respect to dividends to, distributions
to, or amounts set aside for or credited to the benefit of investors and
allowed as a deduction in the computation of federal taxable income.
      (7)    Deduct, to the extent not otherwise deducted or excluded in
computing federal taxable income, any income derived from a transfer agreement
or from the enterprise transferred under that agreement under section 4313.02
of the Revised Code.
      (8)    Deduct exempt income to the extent not otherwise deducted or
excluded in computing adjusted federal taxable income.
      (9)    Deduct any net profit of a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that net profit in
the group's federal taxable income in accordance with section
193.063  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (10)    Add any loss incurred by a pass-through entity owned directly or
indirectly by the taxpayer and included in the taxpayer's federal taxable
income unless an affiliated group of corporations includes that loss in the
group's federal taxable income in accordance with section
193.063  of the Codified Ordinances.
   If the taxpayer is not a C corporation, is not a disregarded entity that has
made the election described in section
193.063  of the Codified Ordinances, and is not a publicly traded partnership
that has made the election described in section
193.063  of the Codified Ordinances, the taxpayer shall compute adjusted
federal taxable income under this section as if the taxpayer were a C
corporation, except guaranteed payments and other similar amounts paid or
accrued to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder, member,
or former member shall not be allowed as a deductible expense unless such
payments are in consideration for the use of capital and treated as payment of
interest under section 469 of the Internal Revenue Code or United States
treasury regulations. Amounts paid or accrued to a qualified self-employed
retirement plan with respect to a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member of the taxpayer, amounts paid or accrued
to or for health insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former
shareholder, member, or former member, and amounts paid or accrued to or for
life insurance for a partner, former partner, shareholder, former shareholder,
member, or former member shall not be allowed as a deduction.
   Nothing in division (B) of this section shall be construed as allowing the
taxpayer to add or deduct any amount more than once or shall be construed as
allowing any taxpayer to deduct any amount paid to or accrued for purposes of
federal self-employment tax.
   (C)    "Taxpayer" has the same meaning as in section
193.03  of the Codified Ordinances, except that "taxpayer" does not include
natural persons or entities subject to the tax imposed under Chapter 5745. of
the Revised Code. "Taxpayer" may include receivers, assignees, or trustees in
bankruptcy when such persons are required to assume the role of a taxpayer.
   (D)    "Tax return" or "return" means the notifications and reports required
to be filed pursuant to sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of reporting municipal
income taxes, and includes declarations of estimated tax.
   (E)    "Taxable year" means the calendar year or the taxpayer's fiscal year
ending during the calendar year, or fractional part thereof, upon which the
calculation of the taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income is based pursuant
to this chapter. If a taxpayer's taxable year is changed for federal income tax
purposes, the taxable year for purposes of sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances is changed accordingly but may consist of an
aggregation of more than one taxable year for federal income tax purposes. The
tax commissioner may prescribe by rule an appropriate period as the taxable
year for a taxpayer that has had a change of its taxable year for federal
income tax purposes, for a taxpayer that has two or more short taxable years
for federal income tax purposes as the result of a change of ownership, or for
a new taxpayer that would otherwise have no taxable year.
   (F)    "Assessment" means a notice of underpayment or nonpayment of a tax
issued pursuant to section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.82  APPLICABILITY; TAXABLE SITUS; APPORTIONMENT.
   This section applies to any taxpayer that is engaged in a business or
profession in the City and that has made the election under section
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (A)    Except as otherwise provided in division (B) of this section, net
profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the
boundaries of the City shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the
City for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same proportion as the
average ratio of the following:
      (1)    The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
   As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever
the individual's services are performed, excluding compensation from which
taxes are not required to be withheld under section
193.052  of the Codified Ordinances;
      (3)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)    If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the City, the taxpayer may request, or the tax commissioner may require, that
the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of the income of the
taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one or more of the
following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the tax commissioner denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances.
      (3)    The tax commissioner may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances.
   (C)    As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and
other compensation" includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
      (1)    A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
         (a)    The employer;
         (b)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)    A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the tax commissioner determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If
the tax commissioner makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the tax
commissioner's determination was unreasonable.
   (D)    For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to the City as
follows:
      (1)    Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the City  only if, regardless of where title passes, the property
meets either of the following criteria:
         (a)    The property is shipped to or delivered within the City from a
stock of goods located within the City.
         (b)    The property is delivered within the City from a location
outside the City, provided the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the City and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (2)    Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
City to the extent that such services are performed in the City.
      (3)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the City  shall be sitused to the City.
      (4)    To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the City shall be sitused to the City.
      (5)    Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the City based upon the extent to which the
tangible personal property is used in the City.
   (E)    Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the
sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the City in which
the real estate is located. Net profit reported by the real estate agent or
broker shall be allocated to the City based upon the ratio of the commissions
the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
located in the City to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or
lease of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
   (F)    If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34) of section
193.03  of the Codified Ordinances by the City or substantially similar
provision of the codified ordinances of another municipal corporation, the
taxpayer shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's
net profit that was apportioned to the City. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to the City any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation.
This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the
amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to the City under this
section.
   (G)    When calculating the ratios described in division (A) of this section
for the purposes of that division or division (B) of this section, the owner of
a disregarded entity shall include in the owner's ratios the property, payroll,
and gross receipts of such disregarded entity. (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)

basis for the referral.
      (2)    If the tax commissioner declines to audit a taxpayer referred by
the tax administrator under this section, the City reserves its right to pursue
any and all remedies, whether at law or in equity, to ensure that the correct
tax liability has been calculated and paid by the taxpayer.
         (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.85  FILING OF ANNUAL RETURN; REMITTANCE; DISPOSITION OF FUNDS.
   (A)   (1)    For each taxable year, every taxpayer shall file an annual

193.82 , and, if applicable, 193.86 of the Codified Ordinances onto its annual
return.
      (3)    The remittance shall be made payable to the treasurer of state and

information.
         (b)    A taxpayer that files an annual tax return electronically
through the Ohio business gateway or in another manner as prescribed by the tax
commissioner shall either submit the documents required under this division
electronically as prescribed at the time of filing or, if electronic submission

taxation shall publish a method of electronically submitting the documents
required under this division on or before January 1, 2019.
      (3)    After a taxpayer files a tax return, the tax commissioner may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required to determine and verify the taxpayer's municipal income tax.
   (D)   (1)   (a)    Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a tax return with the
commissioner under this section. The extended due date of the return shall be
the fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
         (b)    A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that
the commissioner grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for
filing the taxpayer's municipal income tax return. If the commissioner receives
the request on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due, the
commissioner shall grant the taxpayer's extension request.
         (c)    An extension of time to file under division (D)(1) of this
section is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the tax
commissioner grants an extension of that date.
      (2)    If the commissioner considers it necessary in order to ensure
payment of a tax imposed in accordance with section 193.011 of the Codified
Ordinances, the commissioner may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
   (E)    Each return required to be filed in accordance with this section
shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another person,
including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate with
the tax commissioner about matters pertaining to the return. The return or
instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by checking the box
the taxpayer authorizes the commissioner to contact the preparer or other
person concerning questions that arise during the examination or other review
of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only to provide the
commissioner with information that is missing from the return, to contact the
commissioner for information about the examination or other review of the
return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or payments, and to respond to
notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or return preparation that the
taxpayer has received from the commissioner and has shown to the preparer or
other person.
   (F)    When income tax returns or other documents require the signature of a
tax return preparer, the tax commissioner shall accept a facsimile or
electronic version of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.  (Ord.
18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.851  ELECTRONIC FILING.
   (A)    All taxpayers that have made the election allowed under section
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances shall file any tax return or extension for

manner as prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)    A taxpayer may apply to the commissioner, on a form prescribed by the

applicant from the requirement and permit the applicant to file the returns or
make the payments by nonelectronic means.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may adopt rules establishing the following:
      (1)    The format of documents to be used by taxpayers to file returns

electronic means.  (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.86  CONSOLIDATED RETURNS.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
state, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)    "Consolidated federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (A)
(1) of this section.
      (4)    "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in
section 4927.01 of the Revised Code.
      (5)    "Local exchange telephone service" has the same meaning as in
section 5727.01 of the Revised Code.
   (B)   (1)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of
corporations may elect to file a consolidated tax return for a taxable year if
at least one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to
municipal income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under division (B)(2) of this
section or a taxpayer receives permission from the tax commissioner. The tax
commissioner shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated tax returns under
this section must be made on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month of
the year following the last year of a five-year consolidated tax return
election period in effect under division (B)(1) of this section. The election
to discontinue filing a consolidated tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (B)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (4)    When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under section
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances, a valid election made by the taxpayer under
division (B)(1) or (2) of section
193.063  of the Codified Ordinances is binding upon the tax commissioner for
the remainder of the five-year period.
      (5)    When an election made under section
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances is terminated, a valid election made under
this section is binding upon the tax administrator for the remainder of the
five-year period.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated tax return for that taxable year if the tax commissioner
determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany transactions
have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a distortive
shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net profits to a
municipal corporation. A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated tax
return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated tax return for all
subsequent taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the commissioner to file a separate return or a taxpayer has
experienced a change in circumstances.
   (D)    A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated tax return in the same manner
as is required under the United States department of treasury regulations that
prescribe procedures for the preparation of the consolidated federal income tax
return required to be filed by the common parent of the affiliated group of
which the taxpayer is a member.
   (E)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in divisions (E)(2), (3), and (4)
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated tax return shall compute
adjusted federal taxable income, as defined in section
193.81  of the Codified Ordinances, by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income"
appears in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of
corporation's" for "a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in
that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall make any
adjustment otherwise required under division (B) of section
193.81  of the Codified Ordinances to the extent that the item of income or
deduction otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or
consolidated in the computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated tax return shall do one of the following
with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for that taxable
year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
193.82  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise
be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in section
193.82  of the Codified Ordinances, include the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net
profit or loss is so included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a
separate taxpayer on the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated tax return shall
exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the purposes of making
the computations required in section
193.82  of the Codified Ordinances, exclude the property, payroll, and gross
receipts of the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated
group's net profit sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances on the basis of the entity's net profits
that would otherwise be included in the consolidated federal taxable income of
the affiliated group.
   
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated tax return shall make the
computations required under section
193.82  of the Codified Ordinances by substituting "consolidated federal
taxable income attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit
from" appears in that section and by substituting "affiliated group of
corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated tax return is jointly and
severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges, or other
amounts applicable under section
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code to the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
(Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.87  FAILURE TO PAY TAX.
   If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances fails to pay any tax as required under
sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, or any portion of that tax, on or before
the date prescribed for its payment, interest shall be assessed, collected, and
paid, in the same manner as the tax, upon such unpaid amount at the rate per
annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the date
prescribed for its payment until it is paid or until the date an assessment is
issued under section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances, whichever occurs first.  (Ord. 18-051. 
Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.88  DECLARATION OF ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Combined tax liability" means the total amount of a taxpayer's
income tax liabilities to all municipal corporations in this state for a
taxable year.
      (2)    "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's combined tax liability for the current taxable
year.
   (B)    (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, every
taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for the current taxable
year, on the form prescribed by the tax commissioner, if the amount payable as
estimated taxes is at least two hundred dollars.
      (2)    Except as provided in division (B)(4) of this section, a taxpayer
having a taxable year of less than twelve months shall make a declaration under
rules prescribed by the commissioner.
      (3)    The declaration of estimated taxes shall be filed on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of the taxable year or on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the taxpayer becomes
subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)    The tax commissioner may waive the requirement for filing a
declaration of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that
the waiver is reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other
factors.
   (C)    Each taxpayer shall file the declaration of estimated taxes with, and
remit estimated taxes to, the tax commissioner at the times and in the amounts
prescribed in division (C)(1) of this section. Remitted taxes shall be made
payable to the treasurer of state.
      (1)    The required portion of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year that shall be paid through estimated taxes shall be as follows:
         (a)    On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half per cent of the combined
tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)    On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five per cent of the combined tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)    On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half per cent of the
combined tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)    On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the
taxable year, ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the taxable
year.
      (2)    If the taxpayer determines that its declaration of estimated taxes
will not accurately reflect the taxpayer's tax liability for the taxable year,
the taxpayer shall increase or decrease, as appropriate, its subsequent
payments in equal installments to result in a more accurate payment of
estimated taxes.
      (3)   (a)    Each taxpayer shall report on the declaration of estimated
taxes the portion of the remittance that the taxpayer estimates that it owes to
each municipal corporation for the taxable year.
         (b)    Upon receiving a payment of estimated taxes under this section,
the commissioner shall immediately forward the payment to the treasurer of
state. The treasurer shall credit the payment in the same manner as in division
(B) of section 718.85 of the Revised Code.
   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of estimated taxes, there shall
be added to the taxes an amount determined at the rate per annum prescribed by
section 5703.47 of the Revised Code upon the amount of underpayment for the
period of underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as
described in division (E) of this section. The amount of the underpayment shall
be determined as follows:
         (a)    For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, twenty-two
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (b)    For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, forty-five
per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the
date prescribed for that payment;
         (c)    For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, sixty-seven
and one-half per cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes
paid by the date prescribed for that payment;
         (d)    For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, ninety per
cent of the combined tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date
prescribed for that payment.
      (2)    The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the
estimated payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is
made. For purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before
any payment date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment
only to the extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the
payment presently due.
      (3)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as
taxes collected under sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in accordance with section 718.83 of the Revised Code.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of a combined tax liability shall be
due to reasonable cause and the penalty imposed by this section shall not be
added to the taxes for the taxable year if any of the following apply:
      (1)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least
ninety per cent of the combined tax liability for the current taxable year,
determined by annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of
the month immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)    The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable
year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a municipal
income tax return for that year.
         (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.89  ADDITIONAL PENALTIES.
   (A)    In addition to any other penalty imposed by sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances or Chapter 5703. of the Revised Code, the
following penalties shall apply:
      (1)    If a taxpayer required to file a tax return under sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances fails to make and file the return within the
time prescribed, including any extensions of time granted by the tax
commissioner, the commissioner may impose a penalty not exceeding twenty-five
dollars per month or fraction of a month, for each month or fraction of a month
elapsing between the due date, including extensions of the due date, and the
date on which the return is filed. The aggregate penalty, per instance, under
this division shall not exceed one hundred fifty dollars.
      (2)    If a person required to file a tax return electronically under
sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances fails to do so, the commissioner may impose
a penalty not to exceed the following:
         (a)    For each of the first two failures, five per cent of the amount
required to be reported on the return;
         (b)    For the third and any subsequent failure, ten per cent of the
amount required to be reported on the return.
      (3)    If a taxpayer that has made the election allowed under section
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances fails to timely pay an amount of tax
required to be paid under this chapter, the commissioner may impose a penalty
equal to fifteen per cent of the amount not timely paid.
      (4)    If a taxpayer files what purports to be a tax return required by
sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances that does not contain information upon which
the substantial correctness of the return may be judged or contains information
that on its face indicates that the return is substantially incorrect, and the
filing of the return in that manner is due to a position that is frivolous or a
desire that is apparent from the return to delay or impede the administration
of sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty of up to five hundred dollars may
be imposed.
      (5)    If a taxpayer makes a fraudulent attempt to evade the reporting or
payment of the tax required to be shown on any return required under sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the tax required to
be shown on the return.
      (6)    If any person makes a false or fraudulent claim for a refund under
section
193.91  of the Codified Ordinances, a penalty may be imposed not exceeding the
greater of one thousand dollars or one hundred per cent of the claim. Any
penalty imposed under this division, any refund issued on the claim, and
interest on any refund from the date of the refund, may be assessed under
section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances without regard to any time limitation for
the assessment imposed by division (A) of that section.
   (B)    For purposes of this section, the tax required to be shown on a tax
return shall be reduced by the amount of any part of the tax paid on or before
the date, including any extensions of the date, prescribed for filing the
return.
   (C)    Each penalty imposed under this section shall be in addition to any
other penalty imposed under this section. All or part of any penalty imposed
under this section may be abated by the tax commissioner. The commissioner may
adopt rules governing the imposition and abatement of such penalties.
   (D)    All amounts collected under this section shall be considered as taxes
collected under sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances and shall be credited and distributed to
municipal corporations in the same proportion as the underlying tax liability
is required to be distributed to such municipal corporations under section
718.83 of the Revised Code.
(Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.90  ASSESSMENTS AGAINST TAXPAYER.
   (A)    If any taxpayer required to file a return under section
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances fails to file the return within the time
prescribed, files an incorrect return, or fails to remit the full amount of the
tax due for the period covered by the return, the tax commissioner may make an
assessment against the taxpayer for any deficiency for the period for which the
return or tax is due, based upon any information in the commissioner's
possession.
   The tax commissioner shall not make or issue an assessment against a
taxpayer more than three years after the later of the date the return subject
to assessment was required to be filed or the date the return was filed. Such
time limit may be extended if both the taxpayer and the commissioner consent in
writing to the extension. Any such extension shall extend the three-year time
limit in section
193.91  of the Codified Ordinances for the same period of time. There shall be
no bar or limit to an assessment against a taxpayer that fails to file a return
subject to assessment as required by sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, or that files a fraudulent return. The
commissioner shall give the taxpayer assessed written notice of the assessment
as provided in section 5703.37 of the Revised Code. With the notice, the
commissioner shall provide instructions on how to petition for reassessment and
request a hearing on the petition.
   (B)    Unless the taxpayer assessed files with the tax commissioner within
sixty days after service of the notice of assessment, either personally or by
certified mail, a written petition for reassessment signed by the authorized
agent of the taxpayer assessed having knowledge of the facts, the assessment
becomes final, and the amount of the assessment is due and payable from the
taxpayer to the treasurer of state. The petition shall indicate the taxpayer's
objections, but additional objections may be raised in writing if received by
the commissioner prior to the date shown on the final determination. If the
petition has been properly filed, the commissioner shall proceed under section
5703.60 of the Revised Code.
   (C)    After an assessment becomes final, if any portion of the assessment
remains unpaid, including accrued interest, a certified copy of the tax
commissioner's entry making the assessment final may be filed in the office of
the clerk of the court of common pleas in the county in which the taxpayer has
an office or place of business in this state, the county in which the
taxpayer's statutory agent is located, or Franklin county.
   Immediately upon the filing of the entry, the clerk shall enter a judgment
against the taxpayer assessed in the amount shown on the entry. The judgment
may be filed by the clerk in a loose-leaf book entitled "special judgments for
municipal income taxes," and shall have the same effect as other judgments.
Execution shall issue upon the judgment upon the request of the tax
commissioner, and all laws applicable to sales on execution shall apply to
sales made under the judgment.
   If the assessment is not paid in its entirety within sixty days after the
day the assessment was issued, the portion of the assessment consisting of tax
due shall bear interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of
the Revised Code from the day the commissioner issues the assessment until the
assessment is paid or until it is certified to the attorney general for
collection under section 131.02 of the Revised Code, whichever comes first. If
the unpaid portion of the assessment is certified to the attorney general for
collection, the entire unpaid portion of the assessment shall bear interest at
the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised Code from the
date of certification until the date it is paid in its entirety. Interest shall
be paid in the same manner as the tax and may be collected by issuing an
assessment under this section.
   (D)    All money collected under this section shall be credited to the
municipal income tax fund and distributed to the municipal corporation to which
the money is owed based on the assessment issued under this section.
   (E)    If the tax commissioner believes that collection of the tax will be
jeopardized unless proceedings to collect or secure collection of the tax are
instituted without delay, the commissioner may issue a jeopardy assessment
against the taxpayer liable for the tax. Immediately upon the issuance of the
jeopardy assessment, the commissioner shall file an entry with the clerk of the
court of common pleas in the manner prescribed by division (C) of this section.
Notice of the jeopardy assessment shall be served on the taxpayer assessed or
the taxpayer's legal representative in the manner provided in section 5703.37
of the Revised Code within five days of the filing of the entry with the clerk.
The total amount assessed is immediately due and payable, unless the taxpayer
assessed files a petition for reassessment in accordance with division (B) of
this section and provides security in a form satisfactory to the commissioner
and in an amount sufficient to satisfy the unpaid balance of the assessment.
Full or partial payment of the assessment does not prejudice the commissioner's
consideration of the petition for reassessment.
   (F)   Notwithstanding the fact that a petition for reassessment is pending,
the taxpayer may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the petition. The acceptance of a payment by the treasurer of state does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the petition.
   If upon final determination of the petition an error in the assessment is
corrected by the tax commissioner, upon petition so filed or pursuant to a
decision of the board of tax appeals or any court to which the determination or
decision has been appealed, so that the amount due from the taxpayer under the
corrected assessment is less than the portion paid, there shall be issued to
the taxpayer, its assigns, or legal representative a refund in the amount of
the overpayment as provided by section
193.91  of the Codified Ordinances, with interest on that amount as provided by
that section.  (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.91  REFUND APPLICATIONS.
   (A)    An application to refund to a taxpayer the amount of taxes paid on
any illegal, erroneous, or excessive payment of tax under sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances, including assessments, shall be filed with
the tax commissioner within three years after the date of the illegal,
erroneous, or excessive payment of the tax, or within any additional period
allowed by division (A) of section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall be filed in the form
prescribed by the tax commissioner.
   (B)   (1)    On the filing of a refund application, the tax commissioner
shall determine the amount of refund to which the applicant is entitled. The
amount determined shall be based on the amount overpaid per return or
assessment. If the amount is greater than ten dollars and not less than that
claimed, the commissioner shall certify that amount to the director of budget
and management and the treasurer of state for payment from the tax refund fund
created in section 5703.052 of the Revised Code. If the amount is greater than
ten dollars but less than that claimed, the commissioner shall proceed in
accordance with section 5703.70 of the Revised Code.
      (2)    Upon issuance of a refund under this section, the commissioner
shall notify each municipal corporation of the amount refunded to the taxpayer
attributable to that municipal corporation, which shall be deducted from the
municipal corporation's next distribution under section 718.83 of the Revised
Code.
   (C)    Any portion of a refund determined under division (B) of this section
that is not issued within ninety days after such determination shall bear
interest at the rate per annum prescribed by section 5703.47 of the Revised
Code from the ninety-first day after such determination until the day the
refund is paid or credited. On an illegal or erroneous assessment, interest
shall be paid at that rate from the date of payment on the illegal or erroneous
assessment until the day the refund is paid or credited.  (Ord. 18-051.  Passed
2-20-18.)
   193.92  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    If any of the facts, figures, computations, or attachments required
in an annual return filed by a taxpayer that has made the election allowed
under section
193.80  of the Codified Ordinances and used to determine the tax due under
sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances must be altered as the result of an
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax return, whether initiated by
the taxpayer or the internal revenue service, and such alteration affects the
taxpayer's tax liability under those sections, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the tax commissioner in such form as the commissioner
requires. The amended return shall be filed not later than sixty days after the
adjustment is agreed upon or finally determined for federal income tax purposes
or after any federal income tax deficiency or refund, or the abatement or
credit resulting therefrom, has been assessed or paid, whichever occurs first.
If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal income tax
return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a consolidated
return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax return, the
taxpayer shall notify the commissioner before filing the amended return.
   (B)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. An amended return required by this section is a
return subject to assessment under section
193.90  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of assessing any additional
tax due under this section, together with any applicable penalty and interest.
The amended return shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments from a previously filed return no longer subject to assessment that
are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal tax return.
   (C)    In the case of an overpayment, an application for refund may be filed
under this division within the sixty-day period prescribed for filing the
amended return, even if that period extends beyond the period prescribed in
section
193.91  of the Codified Ordinances, if the application otherwise conforms to
the requirements of that section. An application filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal income tax return unless it is also filed within the
time prescribed in section
193.91  of the Codified Ordinances. The application shall not reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are not affected, either
directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the taxpayer's federal income tax
return.
(Ord. 18-051. Passed 2-20-18.)
   193.93  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS AND OTHER DOCUMENTS AND PERSONS.
   (A)    The tax commissioner, or any authorized agent or employee thereof,
may examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax
returns of any taxpayer or other person that is subject to sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of
any return made or, if no return was filed, to ascertain the tax due as
required under those sections. Upon written request by the commissioner or a
duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every taxpayer or other person
subject to this section is required to furnish the opportunity for the
commissioner, authorized agent, or employee to investigate and examine such
books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns at a
reasonable time and place designated in the request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer or other person that
is subject to sections
193.80  to
193.95  of the Codified Ordinances shall be open to the tax commissioner's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the commissioner, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The
commissioner may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the commissioner determines necessary to show whether or not
that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by a municipal corporation.
   (C)    The tax commissioner may examine under oath any person that the
commissioner reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The commissioner may, for this purpose, compel any such person to
attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers, records, and
federal income tax returns in such person's possession or control. The person
may be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other
tax practitioner at any such hearing or examination. This division does not
authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the tax commissioner compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal income tax returns under this section shall fail to
comply.  (Ord. 18-051.  Passed 2-20-18.)

is to be applied.
      (2)    Such documentation shall be provided in the form prescribed by the

      (3)    Nothing in this section shall be construed to authorize the tax

determine if a taxpayer meets the conditions of a tax credit agreement entered
into by the City and taxpayer under section
193.064  or
193.065  of the Codified Ordinances, or to modify the terms or conditions of

      (Ord. 13-346.  Passed 12-17-13.)
   195.02  RATE OF TAX.
   (a)   Commencing on January I, 2018 and expiring on December 31, 2020, there
is levied a tax of three percent (3%) on all rents received by a hotel for
lodging furnished to transient guests with total receipts applied as follows:
      (1)    Seven percent (7%) gross, shall be charged as an administrative-
collection fee shall be deposited in the Transient Occupancy Tax Fund and
transferred to the General Fund.
      (2)    Forty-three percent (43%) gross, of said tax receipts shall be
deposited in the Transient Occupancy Fund and transferred to the General Fund.
      (3)    The remaining balance of said tax receipts shall be split between
Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau and Main Street Mansfield dba
Downtown Mansfield, Inc. fifty percent (50%) going to each organization.
      (4)    A financial review will be performed semi-annually, and if the tax
receipts increase; the percentage shared between Richland County Convention and
Visitors Bureau and Main Street Mansfield dba Downtown Mansfield Inc. will be
reviewed for a possible increase. The Mayor will ask Council for any
adjustments at that time.  (Ord. 17-212.  Passed 11-7-17.)
   (b)   This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient guest to the City,
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator as trustee for the City,
or to the City.  The transient guest shall pay the tax to the operator of the
hotel at the time the rent is paid.  If the rent is paid in installments, a
proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment.  The unpaid
tax shall be due upon the transient guest ceasing to occupy space in the

   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax, or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Director shall proceed in such
manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his
estimate of the tax due.  As soon as the Director procures such facts and
information upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this
chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the
same and to make a report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and
assess against the operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by
this chapter.  In case such determination is made, the Director shall give
notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally, or by depositing it
in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his
last known place of address.  The operator may within ten days after the
serving or mailing of the notice make application in writing to the Director
for a hearing on the amount assessed.  If an application by the operator for a
hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and
penalties, if any, determined by the Director, shall become final and
conclusive, and immediately due and payable.  If an application is made, the
Director shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner
prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in
the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for the tax,
interest and penalties.  At the hearing, the operator may appear and offer
evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. 
After the hearing, the Director shall determine the proper tax to be remitted,
and shall give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
the determination and the amount of the tax, interest and penalties.  The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days, unless an

Review by filing a notice of appeal with the Director within fifteen days of
the serving or mailing of the determination of the tax due.  The Board shall
fix a time and place for hearing the appeal and shall give notice in writing to
the operator at his last known place of address.  The findings of the Board
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service
of a notice of hearing.  Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due
and payable upon the service of notice.

Director shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

received by the City under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in
subsections (b) and (c) hereof provided a claim in writing therefor, stating,
under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded,

credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either
been refunded to the transient guest or credited to rent subsequently payable
by the transient to the operator.
   (c)   A transient guest may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, or paid more
than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City, by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection (a) hereof, but only when

satisfaction of the Director that the transient guest has been unable to obtain

is authorized and directed to provide for the sale of surplus property,
including equipment, supplies and motor vehicles in the following manner:
   (a)   At such time as personal property of the Municipality serves no useful
municipal purpose, either the Safety Director or the Public Works Director
shall direct the Operations Supervisor to provide for the sale of such surplus
property as provided in this section.  Such determination shall be made not
less than once during each calendar year.
   (b)   Sale of surplus property as determined in subsection (a) hereof shall
be sold by the Operations Manager by one or more of the following methods:
      (1)   By informal auction involving the acceptance of sealed bids after
advertising not less than two times in a newspaper of general circulation in
the Municipality.
      (2)   By public auction, after advertising not less than two times in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Municipality.
   (c)   Either the Safety Director or the Public Works Director or his
designee shall estimate the fair market value of the property to be sold under
the provisions of this section, using available valuation resources including,
but not limited to blue books, etc.  If an item of property is determined to
have a fair market value in excess of one thousand dollars ($1,000), then its
sale shall be authorized by ordinance before sale as provided in subsection (b)
(1) hereof.
   (d)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subsections (a), (b) or
(c) hereof and regardless of the property’s value, City Council may sell
personal property, including motor vehicles acquired for use of municipal
officers and departments, and road machinery, equipment, tools, or supplies,
which is not needed for public  use, or is obsolete or unfit for the use for
which it was acquired, by Internet auction.  Council may contract with a
private Internet-based auction system to conduct the Internet auction or it
shall conduct such auction itself.  Council shall adopt, during each calendar
year, a resolution expressing its intent to sell unneeded, obsolete and unfit
property by Internet auction and shall state within such resolution the general
terms and conditions of sale and whether the auction will be conducted by
contract with a private Internet-based auction system or by the Municipality
itself.  If a private Internet-based auction system is to be utilized, the
name, address and telephone number of the system shall be set forth in such
resolution.  After adoption of the resolution, Council shall cause to be
published twice during consecutive weeks, in a newspaper of general
circulation, notice of its intent to sell unneeded, obsolete or unfit municipal
personal property by Internet auction.  A similar notice shall be posted
continually throughout the calendar year in a conspicuous place in the City
Building.  It shall also be posted continually throughout the calendar year in
a conspicuous place in the City Building.  It shall also be posted on the
City’s website on the Internet.
As used in this section, “Internet” means the international computer network of
both federal and non-federal interoperable packet switched data networks,
including the graphical sub-network called the world wide web.
   (e)   The proceeds from the sale of surplus property shall be deposited in
the General Fund.
   (f)   Should either the Safety Director or the Public Works Director find
and determine that surplus property of the City has no value and therefore
should be disposed of, one of them shall direct the Operations Supervisor to
cause such property to be destroyed or abandoned.
   (g)   The Finance Director shall keep records with respect to the sale,
destruction or abandonment of surplus property disposed of in accordance with
this section.

proper identification and the recorded speed.
   II.   ENHANCED ELECTRONIC ENFORCEMENT
   (a)   Civil Enforcement System Established.  The City of Mansfield hereby
adopts a civil enforcement system for speeding offenders photographed by law
enforcement personnel using an “electronic speed enforcement device” as defined
in subsection (n) hereof.  This civil enforcement system imposes monetary
liability on the “owner” of a vehicle as defined in subsection (n) hereof for
failure of an operator to comply with the posted speed limitation.
   (b)   Speeding Offense; Liability Imposed.  The owner of a vehicle shall be
liable for the penalty imposed under this section if the vehicle is operated at
a speed in excess of the limitations set forth in Section
333.03.
   (c)   Liability Does Not Constitute a Conviction.  The imposition of
liability under this section shall not be deemed a conviction for any purpose
and shall not be made part of the operating record of any person on whom the
liability is imposed.
   (d)   Other Offenses and Penalties Not Abrogated.  Nothing in this section
shall be construed as altering or limiting Section
 333.03 of these Codified Ordinances, the criminal penalties imposed by that
section, or the ability of a police officer to enforce that section against any
offender observed by the officer violating that section.  Nothing in this
section shall be construed to limit the liability of an operator of a vehicle
for any violation of subsection (b) hereof.
   (e)   Selection of Enforcement Sites.  The selection of the sites for
enhanced electronic enforcement pursuant to this section shall be made on the
basis of sound professional law enforcement judgments, subject to general
oversight by the City Council.  It shall not be a defense to a citation issued
pursuant to this section that such enhanced electronic enforcement was not
properly sited in accordance with this subsection (e) hereof.
   (f)   Notices of Violation.  Any notice of violation (“NOV”) for speeding
under this section shall:
      (1)   Be issued by a Mansfield police officer;
      (2)   Be forwarded by first-class mail or personal service to the
vehicle’s registered owner’s address as given on the state’s motor vehicle
registration; and
      (3)   Clearly state the manner in which the violation may be appealed.
   (g)   Penalties.  Any violation of subsection (b) of this section shall be
deemed a noncriminal violation for which a civil penalty shall be assessed and

system for license suspension”) shall be assigned to the owner or driver of the
vehicle.
   (h)   NOV Evaluation, Public Service and Appeals.  The enhanced electronic
enforcement program shall include a fair and sound NOV evaluation process that
includes review by a Mansfield police officer, a strong customer service
committment, and an appeal process that accords due process to the NOV
respondent and that conforms to the requirements of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (i)   Appeals.  A notice of appeal shall be filed with the Hearing Officer
within twenty- one (21) days after the date listed on the NOV.  The failure to
give notice of appeal or pay the civil penalty within this time period shall
constitute a waiver of the right to contest the NOV and shall be considered an
admission.
Appeals shall be heard by the Parking Violations Bureau through an
administrative process established by the Clerk of the Mansfield Municipal
Court.  At hearings, the strict rules of evidence applicable to courts of law
shall not apply.  The contents of the NOV shall constitute prima facie evidence
of the facts it contains.  Liability may be found by the hearing examiner based
upon a preponderance of the evidence.  If a finding of liability is appealed,
the record of the case shall include the order of the Parking Violations
Bureau, the NOV, other evidence submitted by the respondent or the City of
Mansfield, and a transcript or record of the hearing, in a written or
electronic form acceptable to the court to which the case is appealed.
Liability shall not be found where the evidence shows that the enhanced
electronic enforcement device captured an event is not an offense, including
each of the following events and such others as may be established by rules and
regulations issued by the Director of Public Safety under the authority of
subsection (l) of this section:
      (1)   The motorist is operating a City-owned emergency vehicle with its
emergency lights activated and exceeds the posted speed limitation;
      (2)   The motorist is directed by a police officer on the scene contrary
to the traffic signal indication;
      (3)   The motorist is exceeding the posted speed limit in a work zone or
school zone by less than 6 MPH, or otherwise by less than 10 MPH.
Liability shall also be excused if a vehicle is observed committing an offense
where the vehicle was stolen prior to the offense and the owner has filed a
police report.
The Director of Public Safety, in coordination with the Parking Violations
Bureau, shall establish a process by which a vehicle owner who was not the
driver at the time of the alleged offense may, by affidavit, name the person
whom the owner believes was driving the vehicle at the time.  Upon receipt of
such an affidavit timely submitted to the Parking Violations Bureau, the Bureau
shall suspend further action against the owner of the vehicle and instead
direct notices and collection efforts to the person identified in the
affidavit.  If the person named in the affidavit, when notified, denies being
the driver or denies liability, then the Parking Violations Bureau shall resume
the notice and collection process against the vehicle owner, the same as if no
affidavit had been submitted, and if the violation is found to have been
committed by a preponderance of evidence, the owner shall be liable for any
penalties imposed for the offense.
A decision in favor of the City of Mansfield may be enforced by means of a
civil action or any other means provided by the Revised Code.
   (j)   Evidence of Operation.  It is prima facie evidence that the person
registered as the owner of the vehicle with the Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles,
or with any other State vehicle registration office, or in the case of a leased
or rented vehicle, the “lessee” as defined in subsection (n) hereof, was
operating the vehicle at the time of the offenses set out in subsection (b) of
this section.

$40.00 shall be imposed, for a total additional penalty in such a case of
$60.00.

evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   307.03  NOTICE OF IMPOUNDMENT.
   Within two business days (Saturdays, Sundays and municipal holidays

the twenty-four hour period commencing at the date and time such vehicle is
impounded by legal authority and every succeeding twenty-four hour period
thereafter. When the fees are paid as provided in the first paragraph of
subsection (c) hereof, the owner or other person claiming an impounded vehicle
must remove such vehicle from the vehicle pound within the same day as defined
herein; otherwise, additional storage costs will be incurred and must be paid
as provided in such subsection (c) before the vehicle can be removed from the
vehicle pound by the owner or other person claiming such vehicle. From the
storage charge collected for each day or portion thereof pursuant to this
section, the City may retain as an administrative fee that portion of the daily
storage charge as agreed to by the Chief of Police and the owner or lessee of
the vehicle pound, if other than the City.
   (b)    Impounding Fees.  In addition to any storage fees which may be
assessed under the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, a fee to defray the
costs of impounding, operating, removing or conveying a vehicle, shall be
assessed against the owner or other person claiming any impounded vehicle. Such
fee shall be deemed assessed and due from the moment of impounding as
established in Section
 307.01. Impounding fees are hereby determined to be as follows:
      (1)    Forty dollars ($40.00) for all vehicles towed fromprivate tow-away
zones within the City and for all other vehicles up to and including one ton
trucks and one ton buses impounded within the City limits or from Clearfork
Reservoir.  Of such fee, fifteen dollars ($15.00) shall be retained by the City
as an administrative fee.
      (2)    Fifteen dollars ($15.00) as an administrative fee to be retained
by the City, plus fifty dollars ($50.00) per hour, or portion thereof, for use
of a mediumsized wrecker, when required, computed from the time such wrecker
leaves the garage until the work is completed.
      (3)    Fifteen dollars ($15.00) as an administrative fee to be retained
by the City, plus seventy-five dollars ($75.00) per hour, or portion thereof,
for use of a large-sized wrecker, when required, computed from the time such
wrecker leaves the garage until the work is completed.
   (c)    Payment of Fees.  Payment of fees assessed under the provisions of
subsections (a) and (b) hereof shall be made to the City at the Police
Division, or other designated location, in the Municipal Building; provided, if
the owner or person claiming an impounded vehicle arrives at the scene of
impounding before the vehicle is removed from the point of the violation such
owner or person claiming the impounded vehicle may bar removal of such vehicle
to a pound by payment of the following service call fees which are hereby
established:
   Service calls within the City limits pursuant to subsection (b)(1) hereof
are twenty dollars, if the vehicle has been prepared for removal, if not so
prepared, the service calls are fifteen dollars ($15.00).
   Service calls at Clearfork Reservoir pursuant to subsection (b)(1) hereof
are twenty doll ars ($20.00).
   Service calls within the City limits pursuant to subsections (b)(2) and (3)
hereof are twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
   Service calls at Clearfork Reservoir pursuant to Sections (b) (2) and (3)
hereof are thirty-five dollars ($35.00).
   Such service call fees shall be paid only to the operator of the tow vehicle
and the operator shall issue receipts for such fees in sufficient number to
provide at least one copy thereof to the owner or other person claiming the
impounded vehicle and one copy to the City.
(Ord. 83-054.  Passed 3-15-83.)
   307.05  PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING.
   (a)    Right to Hearing.  A person who is the owner or lienholder of record
of a vehicle which has been impounded pursuant to the authority granted under
Section
 307.01 has a right to a post seizure administrative hearing to determine
whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle. Such person must file
a writtendemand, on forms provided, for such a hearing with the Municipality
within five days after such person has learned such vehicle has been impounded
or within five days after the mailing of the date set in the notice of
impoundment, whichever occurs first.
   (b)    Conduct of Hearing.  A hearing shall be conducted before a hearing
officer, who shall be the Director of Law or his designee, within seventy-two
hours of receipt of a written demand therefor from the person seeking the
hearing unless such person waives the right to a speedy hearing. Saturdays,
Sundays and municipal holidays are to be excluded from the calculation of the
seventy-two hour period. The sole issue before the hearing officer shall be
whether there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. "Probable
cause to impound" means a state of facts from which a person of ordinary care
and prudence would conclude that there were sufficient grounds for removal of
the vehicle under the authority granted in Section
307.01.
   The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and
shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the
hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right
to possession of the vehicle. The Police Division shall carry the burden of
establishing that there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question.
At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written
decision. A copy of such decision shall be provided to the person demanding the
hearing and the registered owner of the vehicle (if not the person requesting
the hearing). The only issue to be considered at the hearing shall be the
correctness of the impoundment of the motor vehicle. Any question of the merits
of any traffic citation issued concurrently with or underlying the impoundment
of the motor vehicle shall not be considered. The decision of the hearing
officer is final. Failure of the registered or legal owner, or their agent to
request or attend a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of
the right to such hearing.
   (c)    Decisions of the Hearing Officer.  The hearing officer shall only
determine that as to the vehicle in issue either:
      (1)    There was probable cause to impound the vehicle, or
      (2)    There was no such probable cause.
   In the event that the hearing officer determined that there was no probable
cause, the hearing officer shall prepare and date a "certificate of no probable
cause", copies of which shall be given to the possessor of the vehicle and the
Police Division. Upon receipt of the possessor's copy of such certificate, the
garage having custody of the vehicle shall release the vehicle to its
possessor. Upon a finding of no probable cause, towing and storage fees shall
be paid by the City in accordance with arrangements made between the City and
such garage. If the possessor fails to present such certificate to the garage
having custody of the vehicle within twenty-four hours of its receipt,
excluding such days when the garage is not open for business, the possessor
shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. Such certificate
shall advise the possessor of such requirements.
   (d)    Pending the outcome of the hearing provided in this section or a
later hearing on the correctness of the impounding a bond may be posted by the
person seeking possession of the vehicle in order to secure its release.
   307.06  SALE OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES.
   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, whenever any vehicle which has
been impounded by a police officer remains in the possession of the
Municipality, unclaimed by any person having the right to possession of such
vehicle, for a period of thirty days, such vehicle shall be sold under the
direction of the Chief of Police at public auction to the highest bidder, after
a notice of such auction has been given by advertisement published once a week
for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the County,
or at the order of the Chief of Police disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage
dealer as defined in Ohio R.C. 4738.01 or a scrap metal processing facility as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4737.05.
   At least fifteen days prior to such sale or disposal, a notice of the date,
time and place thereof shall be mailed by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the owner of such motor vehicle, if ascertainable, and to all
mortgage and lienholders of record, advising them of their rights to claim the
vehicle upon payment of all towing, storage and impounding fees, and in
addition thereto, the costs of any services performed by the Municipality in
order to properly maintain the impounded vehicle.
   In lieu of the foregoing, abandoned junk motor vehicles may be disposed of
to a motor vehicle salvage dealer as defined in Ohio R.C. 4738.01 or a scrap
metal processing facility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4737.05 and in accordance
with the provisions and procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.63.  (Ord. 86-
030. Passed 2-25-86.)
   307.07  VEHICLE POUNDS.
   (a)   The Director of Public Safety is hereby authorized to create a vehicle
pound or pounds to which vehicles may be removed by police officers in the
manner herein provided. Such pound or pounds shall be located at such places as

municipally owned or leased lands or upon private property by agreement with
the owner or lessee thereof. Any pound situated upon private property shall
have an attendant thereat, at the expense of the owner or lessee, at any and
all times during the day or night. 
(Ord. 83-054.  Passed 3-15-83.)
   (b)    Any pound created or designated by the Safety Director under the
provisions of subsection (a) hereof which shall be situated on private lands by
agreement with the owner or lessee of such private lands shall be non-exclusive
in nature and shall be terminable at the discretion of the Safety Director or
the owner or lessee of such lands.
(1969 Code §20.350)
   (c)    No owner or other person claiming an impounded vehicle shall remove
the same from any pound situated on City owned or leased lands without the
consent of the Safety Director or his designated agent. (1969 Code §20.352)
   307.08  IMMOBILIZATION OF VEHICLES BY BOOTING.
   (a)   Vehicles booted under authority of Section
307.01 may be “booted”, for a maximum of seventy-two hours, and then towed.  If
the vehicle is immobilized by a “boot”, a notice of the booting shall be placed
on the windshield, and attached with tape, that explains the reason for the
“booting” and the release procedure.
   (b)   An immobilization fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) must be paid in
addition to any outstanding traffic fines and applicable storage costs in order
to obtain the official release of the vehicle.  Payment must be made in cash,
by money order, certified check, or personal check.  An additional fee of
twenty dollars ($20.00) will be charged for any check returned by the bank for
insufficient funds or because the account is closed.
   (c)   The immobilizating device (boot) is the property of the City and any
damage to this device shall make the offender liable for the destruction of

interfere with the movement of police vehicles, fire-fighting equipment or
ambulance service to other areas of the Municipality.
         D.    The parade would unreasonably interfere with another parade for
which a permit has been issued.
         E.    The information contained in the application is found to be

   313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
   313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
(ORC 4511.99)
   313.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving

to the jurisdiction from which it is requesting the establishment of a school
zone.
         C.   As used in this section, "school zone" means that portion of a
street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway.  Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries.  The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building lines normal to
the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on each approach
direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial
action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at the traditional
school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.
         D.   As used in this subsection, "crosswalk" has the meaning given
that term in Section
301.09.  The Director may, upon request by resolution of Council, and upon
submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a  State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet.  Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;
(2)   Twenty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the Municipality,
except on State routes outside business districts, through highways outside
business districts and alleys;

outside urban districts unless a lower prima-facie speed is established as
further provided in this section;
      (6)   Fifteen miles per hour on all alleys within the Municipality;

the Municipality other than freeways as provided in subsection (b)(10) and
(12);
      (8)   Sixty miles per hour on rural expressways with traffic control
signals and on all portions of rural divided highways, except as provided in
subsections (b)(9) and (10) of this section;
      (9)   Sixty-five miles per hour on all rural expressways without traffic
control signals;
      (10)   Seventy miles per hour on all rural freeways;
      (11)   Fifty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or
expressways in congested areas as determined by the Director and that are
located within a municipal corporation or within an interstate freeway
outerbelt, except as provided in subsection (b)(12) of this section;
      (12)   Sixty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or
expressways without traffic control signals in urbanized areas.
   (c)   It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in subsection (b)(1)A. to  (b)(6) hereof, or any declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and
it is unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed limitations in
subsection (d) hereof.  No person shall be convicted of more than one violation
of this section for the same conduct, although violations of more than one
provision of this section may be charged in the alternative in a single
affidavit.
   (d)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a street or highway as
follows:

highway, expressway or freeway as provided in subsection (b)(8), (9), (10) and
(12) hereof;
      (2)   At a speed exceeding sixty miles per hour upon a highway as
provided in subsection (b)(8) hereof;
      (3)   At a speed exceeding sixty-five miles per hour upon an expressway
as provided in subsection (b)(9) hereof, or upon a freeway as provided in
subsection (b)(12) of this section, except upon a freeway as provided in
subsection (b)(10) hereof;
      (4)   At a speed exceeding seventy miles per hour upon a freeway as
provided in subsection (b)(10) hereof;
      (5)   At a speed exceeding the posted speed limit upon a highway,
expressway or freeway for which the Director has determined and declared a
speed limit pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21(I)(2) or (L)(2).
   (e)   In every charge of violation of this section the affidavit and warrant
shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs.  It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the
speed limits posted upon such signs.

offender alleges, in an affidavit filed with the court prior to the offender’s
sentencing, that the offender is indigent and is unable to pay the fine imposed
pursuant to this subsection and if the court determines that the offender is an
indigent person and unable to pay the fine. 
      (4)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

described in subsection (a)(1) of this section, or if the driver is traveling
on a highway of that type but it is not possible to change lanes or if to do so

offender, if the offender has never held a valid license as a motorcycle
operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial
driver’s license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle

previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for

dollars ($1,000) and, notwithstanding division (A)(3) of Ohio R.C. 2929.27, the

guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense.  If issued, the order shall
be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as
determined by publications of the national automobile dealer’s association. 
The proceeds from any fine imposed under this subsection shall be distributed
in accordance with division (C)(2) of Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination.  If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
Registrar, the Registrar shall take all necessary measures to permit the person
to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to transfer the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:

   339.13  WEIGHING VEHICLE; SCALES TO BE USED; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD.
   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a vehicle and
its load is unlawful may require the driver of such vehicle to stop and submit
to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable, sealed
scale specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of vehicles on highways;
a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a load-
receiving element specially adapted to determining the wheel loads of highway
vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determining the combined load of
all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway vehicle, or a
sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or unloaded. The
driver of such vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed to the
nearest available of such sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided
such scales are within three miles of the point where such vehicle is stopped.
Any vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section.
   Whenever such officer upon weighing a vehicle and load determines that the
weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a suitable
place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as is
necessary to reduce the weight of such vehicle to the limit permitted under
this chapter.

   339.14  SPECIAL WEIGHT RESTRICTIONS.
   Whenever in the judgment of the Director of Public Service any highway or

solid tires or by vehicles exceeding in gross weight or in weight per inch of
tire width the limits set forth in this Traffic Code, he shall erect
appropriate traffic signs prohibiting the operation of vehicles having solid
tires or indicating and designating such weight limits, and it shall be
unlawful to operate over any such highway or part thereof any vehicle having
solid tires or exceeding such weight limits, without securing a permit
thereunto as provided in Section
339.02.

   339.15  GROSS WEIGHT STATEMENT.

document of like nature in lieu thereof, which bill or document is to accompany
a shipment of goods or property by truck, trailer, semitrailer, commercial
tractor or any other commercial vehicle used for the transportation of
property, the gross weight of which, with load, exceeds three tons, with intent
to defraud by misrepresenting thereon the weight of such goods or property to
be so transported.
   Any driver or operator of a commercial car, trailer or semitrailer may
obtain from any person, firm, partnership, corporation or association,
including the owner, lessee or operator of such commercial car, trailer or
semitrailer, owning and operating sealed scales in this State, a written
"statement of gross vehicle weight" showing the gross weight of the vehicle
including the cargo on the vehicle, the name and address of the person issuing

weighed. The driver or operator of the commercial car, trailer or semitrailer
shall retain such statement of gross vehicle weight on his person, and any law
enforcement officer of this State may request that such driver or operator
exhibit it to him. If, upon examining the statement of gross vehicle weight,
the law enforcement officer has reason to believe that the information
contained therein is correct in every respect, he shall endorse it with his
name and the date and place where it was exhibited to him. The law enforcement
officer may then permit such driver or operator to proceed without weighing by
a law enforcement officer of this State. No person shall willfully issue a
written statement of gross vehicle weight and knowingly give any false
information in such statement.
(1969 Code §20.484)

   349.01  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    A parking ticket shall be the summons and complaint for purposes of
issuing parking ticket citations. The provisions of this chapter and all
actions taken pursuant to this chapter are civil and remedial in nature and not
designed to punish the offender and are not criminal offenses. No violation of
this chapter shall be considered a misdemeanor of any class, and no person
shall be arrested for a violation of this chapter or Chapters
351, 
353 or
357.
   
   (b)    Each parking citation issued shall contain the following information:
(1)    The address and phone number of the Mansfield Parking Violations Bureau;
(2)    The location as to where the person cited appears to pay the citation
and the time by which the person must appear and who the person must appear in
front of;
(3)    The procedure to contest the citation;
(4)    The specific ordinance allegedly violated with a description of the
offense; and
(5)    Any penalty for not paying the ticket within the time prescribed.
(6)    Any other information as required by Section
349.02(a).
         (Ord. 98-051. Passed 3-17-98.)
   349.02  PROCEDURES. 
   (a)    A parking enforcement officer or police officer who issues a parking
ticket for a parking infraction shall complete the ticket by identifying the
parking infraction charged, recording the license plate number, type, and make
or model of the vehicle, and indicating the date, time, and place of the
parking infraction charged. The officer shall sign the ticket and affirm the
facts it contains. If the operator of the vehicle is present, the officer shall
personally serve the parking ticket upon the operator. If the operator of the
vehicle is not present, the officer shall constructively serve the parking
ticket upon the owner of the vehicle by affixing the ticket to the vehicle in a
conspicuous place. 
   Constructive service of a parking ticket upon an owner of a vehicle by
affixation as provided in this division, or by the procedure as otherwise
described in this section has the same force and  effect, and potentially
subjects both the owner and the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction, if different, to the same fine and the same
penalties for failure to timely answer or to appear, if a hearing is requested,
as if the parking ticket were personally served on both the owner and operator
of the vehicle at the time of the violation.
   (b)    An operator of a vehicle who is not the owner of the vehicle, but who
operates it with the express or implied permission of the owner is the agent of
the owner for purposes of the receipt of parking tickets served in  accordance
with this section, and personal service of a parking ticket upon the operator
in accordance with this section constitutes constructive service upon the owner
for purposes of this chapter. The operator of a rented or leased vehicle whose
act or omission resulted in an alleged parking infraction shall not be
considered an agent of the owner if the owner is engaged in the business of
renting and leasing vehicles pursuant to a written rental or lease agreement
and if the owner follows the procedures set forth in Ohio R.C. 4521.09.
   (c)    Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4521.09, when a parking ticket is
issued for a parking infraction and is served pursuant to this section, the
operator of the vehicle whose act or omission resulted in the parking
infraction for which the ticket was issued and the owner of the vehicle
involved in the parking infraction, if different, are jointly liable for the
parking infraction and any fine or penalty arising out of the parking
infraction under an ordinance, resolution, or regulation enacted by the local
authority pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4521.02(A). Any owner of a vehicle who pays any
fine or penalty imposed for a parking infraction pursuant to this chapter may
recover the amount paid from the operator of the vehicle whose act or omission
resulted in the parking infraction.

   The following words and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall have the
meanings respectively ascribed to them:
   (a)    "Parking meter" means a mechanical device installed for the
regulation of parking by lawful authority. Each parking meter shall contain a
slot for the deposit of lawful coin of the United States and a receptacle for
receiving and storing such coin. Each parking meter shall display brief
directions as to its operation and the value of lawful coin required to be
deposited. Each parking meter shall contain a timing mechanism which shall
indicate either a balance of legal parking time or overtime parking by an
appropriate signal at the expiration of such lawful time.
   (b)    "Parking meter space" means a space within a parking meter area,
which is designated for the parking of a single vehicle by marked lines on the
curb or paved surface area adjacent to a parking meter. Posted notice on the
meter or on signs shall indicate the maximum consecutive parking time limit
during which a vehicle may be legally parked in a particular parking meter
space and the days and hours when the requirement to deposit lawful coin shall
apply.
   353.02  PARKING ZONES.
   (a)    Parking Zone A is hereby established in the City, the boundaries of
which are set forth in the Traffic Schedules.
   (b)    The Director of Public Safety, unless Council shall revise or reverse
his act or decision, or Council by administrative order or otherwise, may
establish additional zones to be known as parking meter zones on all or part of
the streets and avenues as are now or which may hereafter be regulated by
parking restrictions.
   (c)    In all such parking meter zones, the Director of Public Safety shall
cause parking meters to be installed and shall cause parking meter spaces to be
designated as hereinafter provided and shall fix the time limitations for legal
parking in such zones except as hereinafter provided and the hours during the
day or night when the parking meter or meters must be used and when the time
limitations shall be effective in compliance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, and he shall indicate the time limitations by designating the
same on the parking meter or meters or by appropriate signs posted in proximity
to the meter or meters in such zones.
(1969 Code §20.300)
   353.03  METER LOCATIONS.
   Parking meters installed in the parking meter zones established as provided
in Section
353.02 shall be placed immediately adjacent to the individual parking spaces
hereinbefore described. Each parking meter shall be placed or set in such a
manner as to show or display by a signal that the parking space adjacent to
such meter is or is not legally in use. Each parking meter installed shall
indicate by proper legend the legal parking time established by the City and
when operated shall indicate on and by its dial and pointer the duration of the
period of legal parking, and on the expriation of such period shall indicate
illegal or over-parking.
(1969 Code §20.302)
   353.04  METER AREAS MARKED.
   The Director of Public Safety shall have lines or markings painted or placed
adjacent to each parking meter for the purpose of designating the parking space
for which the meter is to be used and each vehicle parked adjacent to or next
to any parking meter shall park within the lines or markings so established. It
shall be unlawful and a violation of this provision to park any vehicle across
any such line or marking or to park the vehicle in such position that the same
shall not be entirely within the area so designated by such lines or markings.
(1969 Code §20.304)
   353.05  METER PARKING.
   When a parking space in any parking meter zone is parallel with the adjacent
curb or sidewalk, any vehicle parked in such parking space shall be parked so
that the foremost part of such vehicle shall be nearest to the parking meter;
when a parking space in any parking meter zone is diagonal to the curb or
sidewalk any vehicle parked in such parking space shall be parked with the
foremost part of such vehicle nearest to such meter.
(1969 Code §20.306)
   353.06  METER AREA REGULATIONS.
   No person shall park a vehicle or permit a vehicle registered in his name to
be parked, in any space adjacent to a parking meter except in compliance with
the following provisions:
   (a)    When any vehicle is parked in any space adjacent to which a parking
meter is located in parking meter Zone A, the operator of the vehicle shall,
upon entering the parking space, immediately deposit or cause to be deposited
an appropriate coin, or combination of such coins of the United States in such
parking meter and failure to make such deposit shall constitute a violation of
this section. Upon deposit of the appropriate coin or coins of the United
States totaling ten cents in a thirty-minute meter in parking meter Zone A,
such parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle for a period not
exceeding thirty minutes. Upon deposit of the appropriate coin or coins of the
United States totaling twenty-five cents in a two hour meter in parking meter
Zone A, such parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle for a
period not exceeding two hours.
      (Ord. 81-82.  Passed 3-17-81.)
   (b)    If the vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond
the specified time period, the parking meter shall, by its dial and pointer,
indicate such illegal parking and in that event such vehicle shall be
considered as parked overtime and beyond the period of legalparking time, and
the parking of a vehicle overtime or beyond the period of legal parking time
for the coin deposited in any such part of the zone where any such meter is
located shall be a violation of this section and punished as hereinafter set
out. Each and every hour or fraction thereof of illegal or overtime parking
prohibited by this subsection shall constitute a separate violation of this
section.
   (c)    No person shall park a vehicle or permit a vehicle registered in his
name to be parked in any space adjacent to a parking meter while such meter is
displaying a signal indicating that the vehicle occupying such parking space
has already been parked beyond the period of time prescribed as legal parking
time.

illegal parking.
(1969 Code §20.308)
   (e)    No person parking a vehicle within a parking meter space in parking

guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other
jurisdiction.
      (3)   While out of this Municipality, the person conspires or attempts to
commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal
duty imposed by the laws of this Municipality, which omission affects a
legitimate interest of the Municipality in protecting, governing or regulating
any person, property, thing, transaction or activity in this Municipality.
      (5)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
retains property and subsequently brings any of the unlawfully taken or
retained property into this Municipality.
      (6)   While out of this Municipality, the person unlawfully takes or
entices another and subsequently brings the other person into this
Municipality.
      (7)   The person, by means of a computer, computer system, computer
network, telecommunication, telecommunications device, telecommunications
service, or information service, causes or knowingly permits any writing, data,
image, or other telecommunication to be disseminated or transmitted into this
Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of
the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (h)   As used in this section, “computer”, “computer system”, “computer
network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01. (ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An "offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant" includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   "Public servant" has the same meaning as in Section 525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.  (ORC
2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is his specific intention to cause a
certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition against
conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is his specific intention to engage in conduct of that
nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of his purpose, when he is aware
that his conduct will probably cause a certain result or will probably be of a
certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when he is aware that
such circumstances probably exist.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that his conduct is likely
to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain nature.  A person is
reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he perversely disregards a known risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, he fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his conduct may cause a
certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is negligent with
respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due care, he
fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
(1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
(2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
(3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
(1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in conduct
constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct, or
tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
(2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
   501.13  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing

   515.06  COMPLAINT PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Whenever it is charged in writing and under oath, by a person,
referred to as the "complainant" that any person, referred to as the
"respondent" has engaged or is engaging in any unlawful discriminatory practice
(s) in Section
515.02 or upon its own initiative in matters relating to such unlawful
discriminatory practices, the Fair Housing Officer or a committee designated by
the Fair Housing Commission shall initiate a preliminary investigation. Such
preliminary investigation shall be an attempt to determine whether or not there
is any merit to the charge. If it is determined after such preliminary
investigation that it is not probable that any unlawful discriminatory practice
has occurred, the Fair Housing Officer or the committee shall notify the
"respondent" and the "complainant" of its determination and no further action
wild be pursued. No such complaint shall be made later than 120 days after the
date of occurrence of the act or practice complained of.
   If it is determined that it is probable that any unlawful discriminatory
practice has occurred, the Fair Housing Officer or the designated committee
shall endeavor to eliminate such practices by informal methods of conference,
conciliation and persuasion, which proceedings may include or involve the
execution by the parties of a written conciliation agreement setting forth the
manner, terms and conditions of the resolution of such dispute and requiring
compliance with any such terms and conditions. Nothing said or done during any
such endeavors at conciliation shall be disclosed by any member of the
Commission or its staff or be used in any subsequent proceedings. If, after
such investigation and conference, the Fair Housing Officer or the designated
committee is satisfied that any unlawful discriminatory practice of the
respondent will be eliminated, it may treat the complaint as conciliated.
   If the Fair Housing Officer or the designated committee fails to effect the
elimination of any unlawful discriminatory practice(s) and to obtain voluntary
compliance with this chapter, the Fair Housing Commission shall issue and cause
to be served upon any person or respondent a complaint stating the charges in
that respect and containing a notice of hearing before a hearing examiner
appointed by the Commission at a place therein fixed to be held not less than
ten days after the service of such complaint. Such hearing shall be held at a
place designated by the Commission. The City Law Director, a member of his/her
staff, or an attorney appointed by the Commission may represent the Commission
at such hearing.
   (b)    Any complaint may be amended by the Commission or its hearing
examiner conducting the hearing, at any time prior to or during the hearing
based thereon. The respondent shall have the right to file an answer or to
amend an answer to the original or amended complaint, and to appear at such
hearing in person, be represented by an attorney or other person, or otherwise
to examine and cross-examine witnesses.
   (c)    The complainant shall be a part to the proceeding and any person who
is an indispensable party to a complete determination or settlement or a
question involved in a proceeding shall be joined. Any person who has or claims
an interest in the subject of the hearing and in obtaining or preventing relief
against the acts or practices complained of may, in the discretion of the
person or persons conducting the hearing, be permitted to appear for the
presentation of oral or written arguments.
   (d)    In any proceeding, the hearing examiner or the Commission shall not
be bound by the rules of evidence prevailing in the courts of law or equity,
but shall, in ascertaining the practices followed by the respondent, take into
account all reliable, probative and substantial evidence, statistical or
otherwise, produced at the hearing which may tend to prove the existence or
nonexistence of any unlawful discriminatory practice(s) or a predetermined
pattern of unlawful discriminatory practice(s).
   (e)    The testimony taken at the hearing shall be under oath and shall be
reduced to writing and filed with the Commission. Thereafter, at its
discretion, the Commission or its hearing examiner upon notice to the
complainant and to the respondent with an opportunity to be present may take
further testimony or hear argument.
   No person shall be compelled to be a witness against himself at any hearing
before the Commission or a hearing examiner of the Commission.
   (f)    If upon all the reliable, probative and substantial evidence, the
hearing examiner determines that the respondent has engaged in, or is engaging
in, any unlawful discriminatory practice(s) charged in the complaint, the
hearing examiner shall state in writing to the Commission the findings of fact
and conclusions of law and any recommendations concerning remedial action to be
taken. Whereupon, the Commission shall issue and cause to be served on such
respondent an order requiring such respondent to cease and desist from such
discriminatory practice(s) and to take such further affirmative or other action
as will effectuate the purpose of this chapter.
   (g)    If the hearing examiner finds that no probable cause exists for
crediting the charges, or if upon all the evidence, the hearing examiner finds
that a respondent has not engaged in any discriminatory unlawful practice(s)
against the complainant or others, the examiner shall state in writing to the
Commission the findings of fact and conclusion of law and the Commission shall
issue and cause to be served on the complainant and the respondent an order
dismissing the complaint as to such respondent.
   (h)    Any party to the proceeding, claiming to be aggrieved by a final
order of the Commission, including a determination by it that a prima facie
case was not established by the complainant, may obtain judicial review thereof
by a resort to any court of competent jurisdiction in accordance with the
provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 2506.
(Ord. 89-150.  Passed 7-5-89.)
   515.07  INJUNCTIONS.
   (a)    The existence of any unlawful discriminatory practice and the
commission of any act constituting the same, is hereby declared to be a public
nuisance, and any person injured or aggrieved thereby may apply to a court of
competent jurisdiction for an order in joining the continuance of any such
practice or act, and if it appears from the facts alleged in a properly filed
complaint that there is a great probability of immediate and irreparable damage
to the complainant as a result of the alleged discriminatory act, the Fair
Housing Commission after investigation, may request the City Law Director to
apply to a court of competent jurisdiction for an order enjoining the
continuance of any such practice or act.
   (b)    Whenever deemed necessary in order to protect the rights of the
complainant and to preserve the power to the Commission to act upon or to
resolve a complaint, or to seek compliance with a cease and desist order of a
conciliation agreement, the Commission may apply to a court of competent
jurisdiction for an injunction directed against a respondent, restraining the
respondent from taking any action which would prevent the Commission from
acting or which would make any order issued by the Commission meaningless.
(Ord. 89-150.  Passed 7-5-89.)
   515.08  LIMITATION OF JURISDICTION; TERMINATION OF PENDING PROCEEDINGS.
   The Fair Housing Commission shall have no authority to entertain or proceed
with any complaint if the facts upon which the same is founded have by action
of the complainant been made the subject of any civil or criminal proceeding in
any court of competent jurisdiction.
(Ord. 89-150.  Passed 7-5-89.)
   515.99  PENALTY.
   (a)    Whoever fails to comply with the subpoena issued by the Fair Housing
Commission shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
(b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or

(d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in sexual
activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the prostitute or
to another.
(e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or performance
describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement, or sado-
masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
(f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary adults,
or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially susceptible group,
judged with reference to such group, any material or performance is "obscene"
if any of the following apply:
(1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
(2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends to
represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
(3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
(4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by displaying
or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which inspires
disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without serving
any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic purpose;
(5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual activity,
masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or bizarre
violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of elimination, the
cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to prurient or
scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is primarily for its
own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than primarily for a genuine
scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic purpose.

(1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
(2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to its
former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable cost
of restoring the property.
(3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and the
physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to its
former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal property,
is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind and

545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an

employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section

545.15 or

may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

licenses granted hereunder. In the event of misconduct on the part of a
licensed taxicab owner or a licensed taxicab driver which would show him or her

already granted.

degree.

satisfactory and genuine bill of sale, invoice or statement is sooner
presented.
   Failure to furnish a satisfactory and genuine bill of sale, invoice or
statement within forty-eight hours from the time that such truck, trailer or

boughs so impounded are not the property of the person engaged in transporting
them and that such person is unlawfully transporting such trees or boughs.

CROSS REFERENCES
Assessments - see Ohio R.C. 701.05, Ch. 727
   903.01  CORNER LOT ADJUSTMENTS.
   The following criteria and considerations are hereby established to control
the granting of corner lot adjustments in street improvement projects wherein
bounding and abutting property is assessed a portion of the cost of such
improvement:
   (a)    A corner lot is deemed to be a parcel of land abutting on two of its
continuous dimensions upon:
      (1)    Two intersecting public streets or ways, or
      (2)    A single named public street or way whose continuous path abuts
such two continuous dimensions of the parcel.
   (b)    Only a single adjustment shall be granted to any corner lot, whether
heretofore or hereafter granted.
   (c)    An adjustment shall be granted to a corner lot only after both
dimensions of the parcel referred to in subsection (a) hereof have been
specially benefited by street improvements abutting thereon.
   (d)    The adjustment shall be a reduction of the special assessment last
levied against the parcel equal to one-third of the amount assessed against the
parcel for the improvement abutting the longer of the two dimensions referred
to in subsection (a) hereof. Provided, no adjustment shall exceed the total
amount last levied against the parcel for an improvement abutting one of the
dimensions referred to in subsection (a) hereof.
   (e)    When a corner lot qualifies for an adjustment under the provisions
hereof, such adjustment shall be made as a matter of course and no request
therefor shall be deemed necessary.
   (f)    The amount of the adjustment shall be assumed as an additional part
of the cost to the City of the improvement, and the adjustment can only be
granted at the time the assessments for the improvement are levied.
   (g)    As used in this chapter, "street improvement" means grading to the
established grade, constructing curbs and gutters, storm drainage, etc., and
paving to a minimum width of twenty-eight feet with some suitable material.

   (a)    Any person desiring for necessary purposes to make an opening in any
street in the City shall make a written application to the Bureau of Buildings,
Inspections, Licenses and Permits for a permit to open such street. Such
application shall set forth the location, kind and extent of the pavement
desired to be taken up, the purpose and size of the openings to be made and the
time when such openings are desired or necessary.
   Upon such application being filed the applicant shall pay to the Bureau the
sum of fifty dollars ($50.00) as an inspection and permit fee and shall deposit
with the Bureau a backfill and repair deposit calculated in accordance with the
following schedule:
 
                        Per lineal foot opening
(1) Improved Streets    $50.00
(2) Unimproved Streets    30.00
(3) Grass or Lawn Strip   30.00
(4) Sidewalk              30.00
   The amount of deposit shall be calculated by multiplying the above rate
times the centerline distance of opening within the sidewalk, grass or
lawnstrip, unimproved street or improved street area.
   Grass or lawn strip shall be measured from the right-of-way line to the
traveled edge of the street and the street opening shall be measured from the
traveled edge of the street to the furthest end of and along with the opening.
   (b)    When it becomes necessary by reason of the negligence or failure of
the applicant or for any other reason, for City forces to provide, maintain,
replace, erect or re-erect barriers, warning lights, traffic control devices,
flares or other warning and safety devices in and about the excavation as
required by law or to backfill, relay or repair the opening or the backfill as
made by the applicant, then the reasonable cost and expense of the labor and
materials so provided by the City in remedying such defects shall be chargeable
against the applicant and against the deposit made.
   (c)    The Bureau shall make an inspection of the applicant's work not less
than forty-five days nor more than fifty days after notice from the applicant
that his backfill and repairs have been completed. After a satisfactory
inspection report has been filed, the deposit, less any amounts chargeable
under this section, shall be refunded to the applicant. No permit shall be
issued to any applicant who has not satisfied all charges and fees against him
arising from the granting of a prior street opening permit. Upon compliance
with this section the Bureau shall issue its permit for the opening of the
street specified in the application.
   (d)    The deposits established in subsection (a) hereof shall not be
required of public utility companies under franchise with, and operating in the
City, but the provisions of subsection (b) hereof shall be applicable to such
companies and any expenses and costs incurred by the City in remedying
omissions, neglect and defects shall be chargeable to the public utility
company. (Ord. 13-008.  Passed 1-15-13.)

   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for discharges into the POTW
Authority Sewage Collection and Treatment Systems, and enables the POTW
Authority to protect public health in conformity with all applicable state and
federal laws relating thereto.
   The objectives of this chapter are:
   (a)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal sewage
system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting sludge;
   (b)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the municipal sewage
system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which will pass
through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be
incompatible with the system;
   (c)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim sewage and sludge
from the system.
   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the POTW through
the enforcement of administrative regulations. This chapter does not provide
for the recovery of operations, maintenance or replacement costs of the POTW or
the costs associated with the construction of collection and treatment  systems
used by industrial dischargers, in proportion to their use of the POTW, which
are the subject of separate enactments.
   The procedures, technical information and specific requirements necessary to
accomplish these objectives are detailed in the City of Mansfield Pretreatment
Program, which is administered through the POTW Authority as a part of the
Public Works Department.

joint.  House sewers shall be not less than six inches in diameter. If
installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast
iron soil pipe, except the vitrified clay sewer pipe or Polyvinyl Chloride
(PVC) pipe material may be used if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as
approved by the Public Works Director. 
   (i)    The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the
approval of the Public Works Director, but in no event shall the diameter be
less than six inches. The slope of such six-inch pipe shall not be less than
1.04% or one-eighth inch per foot.
   (j)    Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the
building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be
laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall, which might thereby
be weakened. The building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and in straight
alignment insofar as possible. Changes in direction shall be made only with
properly curved pipe and fittings.
   (k)    In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit
gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such drain shall

passing three-fourths inch; 20-55% passing three-eighths inch; 0-10% passing
#4; 0-5% passing #8. Measurement shall be by weight.
   After the bedding material is placed in the bottom of the trench, the pipe
shall be laid in the bedding material with care being taken to insure that the
bottom of the pipe is resting on the bedding material for its full length. The
pipe shall then be adjusted to the proper elevation by adding or removing
bedding material as required.
   After the piping installation is approved by the Public Works Director, it
shall be backfilled to a depth of at least six inches above the top of the pipe
with granular material conforming to that specified for bedding material. This
initial backfill shall be thoroughly tamped to the satisfaction of the Public
Works Director with precaution taken so that no misalignment and no change in
grade will occur during the backfilling operation.
   The balance of the trench located outside the pavement limits shall be
backfilled with the excavated materials free of large stones or lumps. All
excavations within the limits of street pavement, parking areas or public
drives shall be backfilled with gravel backfill compacted in place. Gravel
backfill shall meet with approval of the Public Works Director prior to its
installation. All excavations shall be adequately guarded with barricades and
lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
   (n)    The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be
made at a wye or tee fitting, if such fitting is available at a suitable
location. If the public sewer is fifteen inches in diameter or less, and no
properly located wye or tee fitting is available, the owner shall at his own
expense install a wye or tee fitting in the public sewer at the location
specified by the Public Works Director. This shall be done by neatly sawing
pipe and connecting with stainless steel "no-hub" connectors. Where the public
sewer is greater than fifteen inches in diameter, and a wye or tee fitting is
not available, connection into the public sewer shall be made by using a saddle
completely encased in concrete and made watertight. Long radius forty-five
degree shall be used, as required, at the wye or tee fittings.
   (o)    The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Public
Works Director twenty-four hours before the building sewer will be ready for
inspection and connection to the public sewer to insure inspection on the
following day. The connection shall be made under the supervision of the Public
Works Director or his representative.

guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard.
Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the course
of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the Public Works
Director.
   (q)    No person authorized and licensed under the chapter to make openings,
taps or connections with sewers, drains or drainage facilities or provide
septic tank cleaning or repair services, shall allow his name to be used by
another for the purpose of obtaining permits, or of doing any work under a
license issued to him.
   (r)    Each person who makes openings, taps or connections with or
constructs sewers or drains upon or over public streets or property, shall keep
in repair and good order the whole of the work executed by him, until the same
is accepted by the Public Works Director or his authorized representative,
which acceptance shall be given in writing, and if deemed necessary by the
Public Works Director may be deferred until the expiration of one year after
the completion of the work.
   (s)    In case it is necessary to connect a drain or sewer pipe with a
public sewer or drainage facility when no junction is left in the same, the new
connection with the public sewer or drainage facility shall be made only when a
representative of the City, designated by the Public Works Director, is present
to see the whole of the work performed.
   (t)    The owner shall maintain and repair private sewers lying within the
right of way limits of dedicated public streets and alleys.
   (u)    The Public Works Director is hereby authorized to make and enforce

accurate information for control mechanism requirements; and is assigned or
delegated the authority to sign documents in accordance with corporate
procedures.
            2.   The authorization is made in writing by the individual
described in paragraph 1.a., b., or c.;
               a.   The authorization specifies either an individual or a
position having responsibility for the overall operation of the facility from
which the industrial discharge originates, such as the position of Plant
Manager, Operator of a well, or Well Field Superintendent, or a position of
equivalent responsibility, or having overall responsibility for environmental
matters for the company; and
               b.   The written authorization is submitted to the Control
Authority.
            3.   If an authorization under paragraph (b) of this section is no
longer accurate because a different individual or position has responsibility
for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization satisfying the
requirements of paragraph (3) of this section must be submitted to the Control
Authority prior to or together with any reports to be signed by a responsible
corporate officer or his designated representative.
All reports and data concerning discharge to the POTW must be designed by a
responsible corporate officer or his designated representative. A letter
delegating responsibility must be submitted to the Wastewater Plant indicating
the designated representative's name and job title.
The City, for good cause shown, considering such factors as local high or low
flow rates, holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating factors, may authorize
the submission of such reports on months other than those specified above.
Should a report of any daily composite sampling (National Categorical or Local
Standards) show a violation of the maximum daily limits, the discharger shall
notify the Control Authority within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the
violation and if directed by the Environmental Compliance Supervisor, commence
fourteen (14) consecutive calendar days of sampling for the pollutant in
violation. If the violation notice is given by phone a written notification
must be received within ten working days. The sampling must be completed within
30 calendar days of first becoming aware of the pollutant in violation. If the
analysis shows a violation, then the discharger will be notified that a
compliance schedule is required. All additional monitoring beyond the minimum
requirements must be reported. If the sampling indicates no additional
violations, then no further action will be required by the discharger at the
time.
Any substantial change in discharge of an industrial user's discharge must be
reported by a responsible corporate officer or his designated representative in
advance including the listed or characteristic hazardous waste for which the
industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR Part 403.12 (p)

pollutants or changes in the nature of pollutants to the POTW by industrial
users where such contributions do not meet applicable pretreatment standards or
such contributions would cause the POTW to violate its NPDES permit.
Where categorical standards allow a three-day average limit and the report of
scheduled sampling shows the discharge exceeds the three-day average but within
the maximum daily limit, the City will perform a second sampling for the
parameter of concern. If the second sampling again indicates the discharge is
in excess of the three-day average, the discharger will be notified and will be
required to report seven days of sampling for that parameter to show the
pollutant does not exceed allowable limits.
         B.   Reports of dischargers shall contain all results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the date the samples were taken, exact

or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fines and
imprisonment for known violations."
An explanation of a responsible corporate officer or his designated
representative can be found in subsection(b)(4)A. hereof.
The frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the
applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or at intervals
determined to be necessary by the City (issued in the discharge permit). If the
pollutant concentration in the discharge is of such varying nature, or if there
is a reasonable risk of a slug of a pollutant that a grab sample of the
wastewater cannot be relied upon to furnish a representative analysis of the
industry's discharge, then the City may require the installation of special
sampling devices, on a case-by-case basis as determined by the City.
This may include a continuous sampling pump coupled to a flow meter in such a
way that the size of the sample is proportional to the total flow (proportional
sampling). The discharger shall be responsible for the collection and testing
of the aforementioned samples. Samples shall be collected in such a manner as
to be representative of the composition of the wastes. Every care shall be
exercised in the collection of samples to ensure their preservation in a state
comparable to that at the time the sample was taken.
Sampling and Analyses. Laboratory procedures used in the examination of
industrial wastes shall be those set forth:
            1.   Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate U.S. EPA guidance, multiple grab samples
collected during a twenty-four-hour period may be composited prior to the
analysis as follows: for hexavalent chromium, cyanide, total phenols, and
sulfides, the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field; for
volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory, or;
            2.   Any other technique approved by the Administrator of the U.S.
EPA.
   (c)   Monitoring Facilities.  Each discharger shall provide and operate at
the discharger's own expense a monitoring facility to allow inspection,
sampling, and flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the City. Each
monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except
where such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the
discharger. The City may concur with the facility being constructed in the
public street or sidewalk area provided that the facility is located so that it
will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. There shall be ample
room in or near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of samples for analysis.
   The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the
discharger. All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and specifications.
Construction shall be completed within ninety days of receipt of written notice
from the City directing the discharger to construct the facility.
   All sewers shall have an inspection and sampling manhole or structure with
an opening of no less than twenty-four inches diameter and internal diameter of
no less than forty-eight inches containing flow measuring, recording and
sampling equipment as required by the City to ensure compliance with this
chapter. Such structure may be utilized by the discharger for his monitoring
program if approved by the City.
   (d)   Inspection and Sampling. The City may inspect the monitoring
facilities of any discharger to determine compliance with requirements of this
chapter. The discharger shall allow the City or its representatives to enter
upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the purposes
of inspection, sampling or records examination. The City shall have the right
to set up on the discharger's property necessary devices to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, metering, operations or all of these. The
City shall have the right to copy the discharger's records relevant to
determining compliance with the requirements of this chapter. If a violation
occurs where City has performed the sampling and analysis in lieu of the
Industrial User, the City shall perform the repeat sampling and analysis,
unless it notifies the user of the violations and requires the user to perform
the repeat analysis. If the City does sampling, they shall perform the repeat
sampling with 30 days of violation unless notifying user and requiring user to
perform the repeat sampling and analysis.
   (e)   Confidential Information.  Information and data furnished to the City
with respect to the nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the
public or other governmental agency without restriction unless the discharger
specifically requests by stamping "confidential business information" on each
page containing such information, and is able to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade
secrets or proprietary information of the discharger. When requested by a
discharger furnishing a report, the portions of a report which may disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by
the public but shall be made available upon written request to governmental
agencies for uses related to this chapter, the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) Permit, the State Disposal System Permit, the
Pretreatment Programs, or all of these, provided however, that such portions of
a report shall be available for use by the State or any state agency in
judicial review or enforcement involving the discharger furnishing the report.
Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
If no claim of confidentiality is made at the time of submission, EPA or the
City may make the information available to the public without further notice.
Information accepted by the City as confidential shall not be transmitted to
any part except as provided herein and unless a ten day notification is given
to the discharger.
(Ord. 16-172.  Passed 8-2-16.)
   935.12  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Violations. No person or discharger shall violate any provision,
regulation or requirement of this chapter. Details of the City's Enforcement
Response Plan (ERP) are contained in the City of Mansfield's Industrial
Pretreatment Program (IPP) under separate cover.
   (b)   Notice of Violation. Whenever the EC Supervisor finds a discharger in
violation of this chapter, he may serve written notice upon the violator
stating a brief and concise description of the violation and direct compliance
with this chapter within ten days.
Service of the notice shall be made personally or by certified mail upon the
discharger or authorized representative of the industrial user. Service is
complete upon date of mailing.
Where a discharger cannot be located, service of notice shall be made by the
City of Mansfield's Police Department.
   (c)   Citation and Hearing. When the violation has not been corrected as
directed by the EC Supervisor, the EC Supervisor may issue a written citation
to the discharger. The citation shall contain a brief and concise description
of the particulars of the violation as well as the time and place of a hearing.
The date of the hearing shall be no earlier than ten days nor later than twenty
days from the date of the service.
   Service of the citation shall be made personally or by certified mail upon
the discharger or authorized representative of the industrial user. Service is
complete on the date of mailing. Where a discharger cannot be located service
of notice shall be made by the City of Mansfield's Police Department.
   The City's Public Works Director and not his authorized deputy, agent or
representative shall be the responsible officer before which the hearing shall
be conducted. He shall determine the order in which the hearing shall proceed.
   At the hearing the discharger or its representative or attorney shall be
permitted to present its position, arguments and contentions. Evidence may be
admitted and witnesses may be examined and cross examined to either support the
discharger's position or to refute evidence and testimony offered by the EC
Supervisor. Further, the right to proffer evidence into the record shall be
recognized. All witnesses shall be placed under oath and the Public Works
Director shall permit subpoenas to be issued upon written request. If neither
the discharger nor its authorized representative appear at the hearing, the
Public Works Director shall proceed with the hearing.
   Within thirty days from the date of the hearing, the Public Works Director
shall render his decision in writing, supported by conclusions of fact
supporting his decision, to all parties. The Public Works Director may order
any appropriate relief including termination of wastewater treatment services
to the discharger. The decision of the Public Works Director shall be a final
administrative order and any discharger adversely affected by such decision may
appeal to the common pleas court according to law.
   (d)   Enforcement Actions: Annua1 Publication. At least annually, the Public
Works Director shall publish a list of all industrial users which at any time
during the previous twelve months were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment requirements. For the purposes of this provision, an
industrial user is considered in significant noncompliance if it has a
violation that meets the criteria in paragraphs (3), (4), or (8) listed below.
A significant industrial user (SIU) is considered in significant noncompliance
if its violation meets any of the following criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits listed in Section
935.09 , defined here as those which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of
the measurements taken for the same pollutant parameter, at any permitted
monitoring point during a six month period exceed (by any magnitude) the daily
maximum limit or the average limit for the same pollutant parameter;
      (2)   Technical Review Criteria (TRC) violations, defined here as those
in which thirty-three percent or more of all of the measurements for the same
pollutant parameter taken during a six month period equal or exceed the product
of the daily maximum limit or the average limit multiplied by the applicable
TRC (TRC = 1.4 for BOD, TSS, Fats, Oil & Grease, and 1.2 for all other
pollutants except pH);
      (3)   Any other violation of a pretreatment standard or requirement
(daily maximum, longer-term average, instantaneous limit or narrative standard)
as described in Sections
935.08  and
935.09  that the Public Works Director determined has caused, alone or
combination with other discharges, interference or pass through (including
endangering the health of POTW personnel or the general public);
      (4)   Any discharge of a pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment
of human health, welfare or to the environment or has resulted in the POTW's
exercise of emergency authority to halt or prevent such a discharge;
      (5)   Failure to meet, within ninety days after the schedule date, a
compliance schedule milestone contained in a wastewater discharge permit or
enforcement order for starting construction, completing construction, or
attaining final compliance;
      (6)   Failure to provide, within forty-five days after the due date
required reports such as baseline monitoring reports, ninety day compliance
reports, periodic self-monitoring reports, reports on compliance with
compliance schedules, or any other reports required;
      (7)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance;
      (8)   Any other violation or group of violations which the Public Works
Director determines will or has adversely affected the operation or
implementation of the City's pretreatment program, including violations of any
Best Management Practice (BMP) established for an industrial user.
   (e)   Operating Upsets. For the purpose of this section "upset" means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with Categorical or Local Pretreatment Standards because of
factors beyond the reasonable control of the industrial user. An upset does not
include noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly
designed treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of
preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
      (1)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with Local or Categorical Pretreatment Standards if
the requirements of paragraph (e)(2) below, are met.
      (2)   Conditions necessary for a demonstration of a upset. A user who
wishes to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence
that:
         A.   An upset occurred and the industrial user can identify the cause
(s) of the upset;
         B.   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent workman-
like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
         C.   The industrial user has submitted the following information to
the City within twenty-four  hours of becoming aware of the upset. (If this
information is provided orally a written submission must be provided within
five days).
      (3)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause of noncompliance;
      (4)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and time or if
not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to continue;
and
      (5)   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
      (6)   Burden of proof. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.
      (7)   Reviewability by the City of consideration of claims of upset. In
the usual exercise of prosecutorial discretion the City enforcement personnel
should review any claim that noncompliance was caused by an upset. No
determination made in the course of the review constitutes final City action
subject to judicial review. Industrial users will have the opportunity for a
judicial determination on all claims of upset in any enforcement action brought
for noncompliance with National or Local Pretreatment Standards.
      (8)   User's responsibility in case of upset. The industrial user shall
control production of all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain
compliance with Local and Categorical Pretreatment Standards upon reduction,
loss or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an
alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement applies in the
situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.
   (f)   Other Remedies. Notwithstanding any other enforcement procedure listed
in this chapter, whenever it is determined there is a substantial danger to the
public health or welfare or a substantial danger to the environment or of
interferences or pass-through to the POTW due to acts or omissions of any
discharger, the City may, through its appropriate officials, seek a temporary
restraining order, temporary or permanent injunction or abatement in the Court
of Common Pleas and shall not be required under these conditions to exhaust the
administrative procedures within this chapter as a condition precedent to the
commencement of such action.
   Notwithstanding any other enforcement procedures listed in this chapter, or
in conjunction with any other enforcement procedure, the City may seek to
terminate the wastewater treatment services to any discharger which fails to
factually report the wastewater concentration and characteristic of its
discharge; report significant changes in the wastewater concentration or
discharge; provide reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the authority for the purpose of inspection or monitoring;
or who violates the conditions of this chapter, or any final administrative
order entered with respect thereto. Any discharge or interested party shall
have the right to request in writing an interpretation or ruling by the City on
any matter covered under this chapter and shall be entitled to a prompt written
reply.
   Any discharge of any sewage, industrial waste pollutant, toxic pollutant or
other waste into the POTW in violation of any provision, regulation or
requirement of this chapter is declared to be a public nuisance and may be
enjoined by the City through its appropriate officials in the Court of Common
Pleas.
   (g)   Bypasses.
      (1)   "Bypass" means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any
portion of a user's treatment facility.
      (2)   "Severe property damage" means substantial physical damage to
property, damage to the treatment facilities which cause them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property
damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.
      (3)   Bypasses not violating applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.  A user may all allow bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are not
subject to the provision of paragraphs (g)(4) and (6) of this section,
      (4)   Notice. If an industrial user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the City, at least ten  days before the
date of the bypass if possible.
      (5)   An industrial user shall submit oral notice to the City of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within
twenty-four  hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written
submission shall also be provided within five  days of time the user becomes
aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the
bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and
times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is
expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and
prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The City may waive the written report on a
case by case basis of if the oral report has been received within twenty-four
hours.
      (6)   Prohibition of bypass. Bypass is prohibited, and the City may take
enforcement action against a user for bypass unless:
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury,
or severe property damage;
         B.   The industrial user submitted notices as required under paragraph
(g)(4) of this section.
      (7)   The City may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering its
adverse effects, if the City determines that it will meet the three conditions
listed in subsections (g)(6)A. and B. of this section.
         (Ord. 16-172.  Passed 8-2-16.)
   935.13  RECORDS RETENTION.
   All dischargers subject to this chapter shall retain and preserve for a
minimum of three years, any records, books, documents, memoranda, reports,
correspondence and any and all summaries thereof, relating to monitoring,
sampling, sampling and chemical analyses made by or in behalf of a discharger
in connection with its discharge. All records shall be made available for
inspection and copying by the retention shall be extended during the course of
any unresolved litigation regarding the discharge of pollutants by an
industrial user or the operation of the POTW Pretreatment Program or when
requested by the Director or the Regional Administrator.
(Ord.97-229. Passed 9-16-97.)
   935.14  INDUSTRIAL WASTEWATER PERMITTING PROGRAM.
   This chapter authorizes the creation of the "City of Mansfield; Industrial
Pretreatment Program (IPP)" under separate cover. The detailed descriptions,
applications, permits and forms comprising this program are located within the
IPP and are maintained under the control of the Plant Manager and administered
by the Environmental Control (EC) Supervisor. The IPP will contain these
elements:
   (a)   Industrial User Listing (as defined in Section
935.02 )
      (1)   Industrial Users
      (2)   Significant Industrial Users
   (b)   Industrial Waste Survey and Wastewater Baseline Analyses Forms.
   (c)   Industrial Discharge Permit Applications.
No Significant Industrial User shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without
first obtaining an Industrial Discharge Permit (IDP). Other Users may also be
required to obtain an IDP, at the discretion of the EC Supervisor. All
Industrial Users will follow the application procedures as described in Section
 935.11 .
      (1)   Any existing User required to obtain an IDP, who was discharging
wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this ordinance and who
wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall within 90 days, submit
a completed IDP Application and Waste Survey to the EC Supervisor.
      (2)   Obtaining an IDP does not relieve a permittee of its obligation to
comply with all Federal and State Pretreatment Standards or with any other
requirements of Federal, State, and local law.
      (3)   The EC Supervisor will evaluate the IDP application and data
furnished by the User and may require additional information. Within 30 days of
receipt of a complete permit application, the EC Supervisor will determine
whether to issue an individual wastewater discharge permit. The EC Supervisor
may deny any application for an IDP.
      (4)   Once the IDP permit has been issued, the EC Supervisor will perform
baseline monitoring of the User within 90 days of commencing discharge to the
POTW, as described in Section
935.11 .
      (5)   A new permit application is required every five (5) years in order
to renew the IDP.
   (d)   Signatory Requirements and Certifications.
All applications and User reports submitted to the City, must be signed by an
Authorized Representative of the User (as defined in Section
935.02 ), and contain the following certification statement:
"I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments were
prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system designed
to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the information
submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who manage the system,
or those persons directly responsible for gathering the information, the
information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true,
accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant penalties for
submitting false information, including the possibility of fine and
imprisonment for knowing violations."
   (e)   Industrial Discharge Permit Contents.
IDPs issued by the City shall include such conditions that are deemed
reasonably necessary by the EC Supervisor to prevent Pass Through or
Interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment
plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety, facilitate sludge
management and disposal, and protect against damage to the POTW. Each IDP shall
contain:
      (1)   A specific permit issuance date, expiration date and effective
date. An IDP shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five
(5) years from the effective date of the permit. An IDP may be issued for a
period of less than five (5) years, at the discretion of the EC Supervisor.
      (2)   The following statement: "Compliance with this permit does not
relieve the permittee of its obligation to comply with any or all applicable
pretreatment regulations, standards, or requirements under local, state, and
federal law, including any such regulations, standards, requirements, or laws
that may become effective during the terms of this permit. There are applicable
civil and criminal penalties for violation of the Pretreatment Standards and
Requirements, and any applicable compliance schedule."
      (3)   Opportunity for Appeal - If a User wishes to appeal or challenge
any conditions imposed in the IDP, a written request may be filed for
modification or rescission of this permit with the EC Supervisor within 30 days
of the effective date of the IDP.
      (4)   A description of the location of the User's discharge outfall(s)
and all applicable effluent limits, including any Best Management Practices
(BMPs) required.
      (5)   All monitoring, sampling and record keeping requirements. These
requirements shall include an identification of pollutants (or BMPs) to be
monitored, the sampling location, sampling frequency, and sample type based on
Federal, State, and/or local law.
      (6)   All reporting requirements, including self-monitoring, BMP
compliance, and accidental discharges. The IDP shall specify the notification
and reporting procedures including addresses and telephone numbers as
applicable.
When compliance with a BMP or a pollution prevention alternative is required,
documentation shall be included with all periodic compliance reports to
determine the compliance status of the User.
      (7)   Any special conditions or special monitoring requirements that the
EC Supervisor deems necessary to ensure the User's compliance with this
chapter, and State and Federal laws, rules, and regulations; including:
         A.   User requirements to control Slug Discharges and/or development
of a Slug Discharge Control Plans as described in Section
935.10 .
         B.   Compliance plan and schedule to meet one or more of the
wastewater discharge limitations within the User's IDP.
         C.   User requirements for installation and maintenance of inspection
and sampling facilities and equipment, including flow measurement devices.
         D.   Reopener clause allowing the City to modify the User's IDP at any

   (f)   Additional Procedures for Operation of the IPP:
      (1)   User Inspections by the City
      (2)   City Sampling of Users
      (3)   User Reporting Requirements
      (4)   User Upset or Bypass Notification
   (g)   Local Limits which are established to protect the POTW against pass
through and interference and the technical justification analyses are detailed
in the IPP. The current local limits are also listed in Section
935.09 .
      (1)   Users must comply with all prohibitions and local limits listed in
these sections.
      (2)   Users that are subject to any categorical pretreatment standard (40
CFR 405-471) must also meet all limits as established in the applicable
regulation, unless any local limit is more stringent that the categorical
limit, in which case the local limit takes precedence.
      (3)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard are
expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, an Industrial User may
request that the City convert the limits to equivalent mass limits. The
determination to convert concentration limits to mass limits is within the
discretion of the EC Supervisor. The Industrial User must also meet all the
conditions of 40 CFR part 403.6(c)(5).
      (4)   The City may also convert mass limits of a categorical pretreatment
standard to concentration limits for purposes of calculating limitations
applicable to individual Industrial Users under the following conditions: When
converting such limits to concentration limits, the Control Authority must use
the concentrations listed in the applicable subparts of the standard and
document that dilution is not being substituted for treatment as detailed in 40
CFR part 403.6 (d).
   (h)   Enforcement Response Plan.
The Enforcement Response Plan (ERP), is to be used as a guidance document for
the City, and implemented as necessary by the EC Supervisor, in enforcing the
Mansfield IPP. The ERP plan shall contain procedures indicating how the City
will investigate and respond to instances of User noncompliance. The ERP shall
describe the types of escalating enforcement the City will take in response to
anticipated types of industrial user violations and the time periods within
which responses will take place. The ERP also includes judicial enforcement
remedies that can be implemented by the City if necessary.
The City retains the right to make case-by-case enforcement decisions and
settlements which may or may not exactly follow the ERP.

(Ord. 92-008.  Passed 1-7-92.)
   937.04  VOLUME OF SEWAGE.
   As described in subsequent sections of this chapter, certain segments of the
sanitary sewer charges are determined by applying a unit charge to a volume of
sewage flow from each user.  In all cases, this volume to be charged for shall
be one hundred percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded on the meters used
to measure water from the water system of the City, unless the user is supplied
with water from a source other than the water system of the City or unless a
substantial volume of water supplied to the user is not discharged to the
sewage treatment works, in which cases, the volume of water discharged to the
sewage treatment works shall be determined by one or more meters installed to
measure water flow and/or sewer discharged, or by other means approved by the
City.  In the event a sewage user is supplied either in whole or in part with
water from wells or any source other than the City Water Division, then such
wells or other source of supply shall be registered with the Service Director.
   In the event a sewage user should elect at his own cost and expense to
install a separate water meter or meters for re-registering or auxiliary meter
for water-cooled air conditioners, lawn sprinklers or other uses which do not
return flows to the sewage treatment works, the volume to be charged for shall
be one hundred percent (100%) of the metered water use and the rates
established in subsequent sections of this chapter shall apply.  In the event a
sewer user shall elect at his own cost and expense to install a meter to
register the exact volume of sewage that enters the sewage works, the volume to
be charged for such metered sewage shall be based upon one hundred percent
(100%) of the actual meter reading and the rates established in subsequent
sections of this chapter shall apply.  Meters installed other than the meter or
meters used to record consumption from the water system of the City shall be
approved by the City and installed and maintained at the expense of the user.
   Sewage meters shall be tested for accuracy at the expense of the owner once
each year.
   The City shall have the authority to remove the meter on its initiative to
undertake to test and correct any meter which in its judgment is registering
incorrectly without the consent of the owner.  Should the sewage meter be found
to be registering outside of the accuracy of the specifications published for
such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and
replacement.  Should the sewage meter be found to be registering within the
accuracy of the specifications published for such meter, the City shall bear
the cost for shipping, testing, repair and replacement.  During the period the
meter is not in service, the volume of sewage discharged shall be determined by
the Service Director.
(Ord. 92-008.  Passed 1-7-92.)
   937.05  USER CLASSES.
   For the purpose of applying sanitary sewer charges, that is, user charges
and debt service charges, all users of the sewage treatment works shall be
classified as a member of one of the following two user classes:
   (a)   Nonindustrial;
   (b)   Industrial.
   An industry may be placed in the nonindustrial user class if the industry
discharges segregated domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary conveniences.
   Any industry whose wastes are not domestic wastes or not wastes from
sanitary conveniences shall be placed in the industrial user class.
   The placement of a user within the nonindustrial user class shall be as
determined by the Service Director in accordance with the above criteria.
(Ord. 92-008.  Passed 1-7-92.)
   937.06  USER CHARGES; WASTES OF NORMAL CONCENTRATION.
   A user charge shall be levied on all users of the sewage treatment works to
provide funds necessary to pay for the cost of operation, maintenance and
replacement of such works.  The user charges shall result in the distribution
of all costs of operation, maintenance and replacement of the treatment works
to each user or user class, in proportion to such user's contribution to the
total sewage loading of the treatment works.  Factors such as strength, volume
and delivery flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the
basis for the user's contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of
operation, maintenance and replacement costs.  The method to be used to
establish the base user charges for sewage within the limits of normal
concentration, as defined in Section
937.02, shall be defined in this section.  The method to be used to establish
extra strength surcharges for wastes in excess of normal concentrations shall
be defined in Section
937.08.
   The volume of sewage from each user shall be subject to a base user charge
per 100 cubic feet, as follows:

   941.02  OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL.
   (a)    The public water supply system of the City, including all water
mains, laterals, valves, hydrants, meters and services, is under the exclusive
control of the Director of Public Service and his authorized agents and
employees. Such control shall include all piping from the City mains to the
point of ultimate consumption or to where the City water is finally discharged
freely at atmospheric pressure. Such control shall be governed by these rules
and regulations and the water by-laws as adopted by the Director of Public
Service.
   (b)    The Division of Water does not guarantee any fixed chemical quality,
fixed pressure or continuous supply, but it will, in case of accident that will
cause sudden change in quality, pressure or supply, endeavor to notify
consumers affected thereby. Those using fixtures or equipment sensitive to
change and receiving their supply direct from the City mains should have
protective equipment, including but not limited to reserve supply tanks,
alarms, pressure regulating valves, for emergency cases as no claims will be
considered for damage of any nature whatsoever arising from such action.
   (c)    Whenever a break or leak occurs in a water main or water service line
between the main and the curb box, the Division of Water will repair this at
its own expense as soon as possible. If a break or leak occurs between the curb
box and the meter at any place upon the premises supplied, it shall be repaired
at the expense of the customer. If the Division of Water, in order to prevent
excessive waste or substantial damage deems it to be an urgent and necessary
action to shut off the water, such action will be taken. The City shall give
notice to the customer and consumer, if any, in accordance with Section
941.12(1). The customer must then make repairs before water service will be
restored.
(Ord. 96-079.  Passed 5-7-96.)

any meter, registering device or seal placed by the Water Division or insert a
meter by-pass without the permission of the Director of Public Service under
penalty provided in Ohio R.C. 4933.99(B). If the Division of Water finds that a
Water Division seal has been broken or any by-pass inserted and there is
evidence that the meter or registering device has been tampered with, water
service to the unit may be terminated in accordance with Section
941.12(a), (f), (g) and (m), and shall not be turned on again until the
consumer or owner of the premises pays for the estimated quantity of water
which has been used and not registered, and, in addition thereto, the standard
fee for turning off and the standard fee for turning on such water. Payment of
the fees herein will not in any way relieve any person from criminal
prosecution. Meters damaged by abuse, misuse, accident or any act of
carelessness shall be repaired at the expense of the customer.
   (b)    No person shall operate, open or otherwise tamper with any valve,
stopcock, curbcock or other device after the same has been closed for violation
of any rule or regulation of the Division of Water, or unlawfully secure a
supply of water through such valve, stopcock, curbcock or other device after
same has been closed for the violation of any rule or regulation of the
Division of Water, or in any way take water for private use unlawfully or
without first having secured the necessary permit from the Bureau of Buildings,
Inspections, Licenses and Permits.
   (c)    No person shall put filth, animal matter, chips, shavings or any
other substance into any City reservoir or bathe or swim therein.
   (d)    No person shall open, close, adjust or interfere with a fire hydrant,
valve, regulator, gauge, gate, curbcock, stopcock, meter or other regulator,
operating a measuring device, or appliance in or attached to the wells, tanks,
reservoirs, conduits, pipes, mains, service pipes, house pipes or other pipes
or apparatus of the City water supply system, with intent to cause the escape
of water or to injure or destroy such property. No person shall tap, sever,
open or make unauthorized connections with a main or pipe used or intended for
the transmission of water. This section does not apply to the agent or employee
for the purpose of the owner or operator of the appliances referred to in this
section, and does not apply to anything done by or under authority of any
regularly constituted fire department. The penalty for violation of this
section is not less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than three
hundred dollars ($300.00) or imprisonment for not more than thirty days, or
both.
   (e)    Any customer or consumer having a connection to the public water
supply system who permits public water to be wasted excessively from such
connection either by unnecessary use, or negligence, or who fails to prevent
excessive waste, may have water service to the unit terminated in accordance
with Section
941.12(a), (f), (g), and (m).
   (f)    No person shall damage or disturb any fire hydrant or any part
thereof or take any water from such hydrant under any circumstances except an
authorized agent of the Division of Water or the Fire Division or a person with
a special permit from the Division of Water. In case any damage is done to a
fire hydrant by any person, he shall upon demand of the Division of Water pay
such damages and all cost and expense incurred by reason thereof.
(Ord. 96-079. Passed 5-7-96.)
   941.04  ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING SERVICE.
   (a)    Any person or entity, who owns a premises to which water service is
or can be delivered, shall have the right to establish a water service account
to pay for future water service to the premises unless:
      (1)    The applicant is a person or an entity who is delinquent on a
water service account for any premises; or
      (2)    The applicant is the person or entity who has failed to cure the
breach for which water service was terminated pursuant to Section
941.12(f); or
      (3)    Conditions exist at the unit for which water service is sought
which would be grounds for termination of the water service pursuant to Section
941.12(1).
   (b)    Any person or entity making application to establish a water service
account shall execute an application agreeing to be responsible for all charges
to the premises in a form and manner approved by the Director of Public
Service.
   The City reserves the right to require an applicant to submit proof of
identification.
   (c)   No person or entity may be denied the right to establish a water
service account to a premises because of an outstanding obligation of some
other person or entity for past water service to that premises except persons
who were members of the obligor's household during the time the outstanding
obligation was incurred and are presently members of the obligor's household.
   (d)    Whenever the City denies an applicant the right to establish a water
service account, the City shall give the applicant a written notice of the
reasons for the denial and of the right of the person or entity to request a
hearing at which to contest the reasons for the denial. Thereafter, the
applicant may request a hearing, and, if so requested, the hearing shall be
granted by the City. Any such hearing shall be conducted by the City in
accordance with Section
941.13.
   (e)    In all cases, the owner of the premises, shall be primarily liable
for all charges for each water service account to the premises.
   (f)   Owners making application may elect to have their accounts billed to
and in the name of their tenants, but only with respect to those premises on
which there is no past due amount owing.  If a property owner and tenant sign
and return a direct billing agreement the City will send to the owner's tenant,
the original billings and property owners will receive only copies of all
delinquency and turn-off notices.
   (g)   In the event it becomes necessary to turn off the water because of a
violation of any of the rules or regulations of the Division of Water, or due
to the request of the customer, a charge of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) will
be made for turning the water off and an additional charge of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00) will be made for turning the water on. The turn off-fee shall
be the responsibility of the customer at the time of the turn off.  The turn on
fee shall be the responsibility of the customer at the time of turn on.  The
turning off and back on of water shall not be construed as "establishing a
water service account" for the purposes of Section
941.01(a), provided the customer maintained ownership of the property while the
water was turned off.
   (h)   The Utility Collections Division shall attempt to give notice by mail
of all due and payable water bills but cannot guarantee the delivery of such
bills. Property owners, when either buying or selling properties, shall see
that notice of transfer of ownership is made at the office of the Utility
Collections Division and that all water bills are paid to date of transfer of
title. The Utility Collections Division shall make every possible effort to
collect water bills as promptly as possible, but no consumer or owner of
property shall be relieved from any obligation for bills that may be unpaid
through failure of the Utility Collections Division to make collections as
provided by its rules. 
(Ord. 13-088.  Passed 4-16-13.)
   941.05  PERMITS FOR SERVICES.
   (a)    Any person or entity, in person or by agent, desiring a water service
connection shall make application for such connection at the Bureau of
Buildings, Inspections, Licenses and Permits. There shall be at least one meter
for each customer.  There may be more than one meter for each building and each
such meter constitutes a separate service. Each meter shall serve a separate
geographical area or be protected by an approved backflow prevention device. 
Each meter shall have a separate shut-off apparatus accessible to employees of
the City Water Division for turning on and turning off service to that
customer. Should property owners wish auxiliary meters inside a building on the
same water service, they may have them, by establishing separate accounts under
these regulations and the by-laws of the Water Division. Cost of meters and
their installation must be at the expense of the owner and meet requirements of
the water by-laws.
   (b)    Any person or entity in person or by agent, desiring a water service
connection for one or more mobile homes to be placed upon a single lot or
parcel under one ownership shall obtain one water tap and one meter only. Water
service shall be extended to mobile home parks at the sole expense of the land
owner(s)and such owner(s) shall be billed and pay for all water used on the
premises. Water service consumers residing in mobile homes shall have the right
to establish a group account as provided in Section
941.12(I).
   (c)    No water service tap or permit will be issued to any consumer on any
private line unless the applicant files a signed release or order of authority
to the Division of Water from the owners of such private line and then only at
the discretion of the Director of Public Service. All rules and regulations not
conflicting by law shall apply to all consumers receiving their supply of water
over private lines from the Division of Water.
   (d)    Any residential consumer who is presently being billed for use of
City water and is presently receiving service, in the sole opinion of the City,
through an inadequate supply main, may request a new tap whenever an adequate
supply main is made available. Such new tap shall be at no cost to the
customer.
   (e)    A new tap shall include the removal and replacement of pavement,
shut-off valve or curb stop and the extension of a service line to a location
behind the sidewalk near the public right of way. All expense and costs
relating to rearrangement of plumbing, resetting the water meter and/or
connecting piping between the new shut-off valve or curb stop and the ultimate
use of water shall be borne by the customer.
(Ord. 96-079.  Passed 5-7-96.)
   941.06  METERS AND REGISTERING DEVICES.
   (a)    Every water service shall be equipped with a meter and a remote
register, unless approved otherwise. All meters shall be the property of the
City. For the purpose of maintaining meters, the Division of Water reserves the
right to remove and then replace or repair any meter at any time without
notice.
   (b)    Each meter shall be sized according to the volume of water used by
the consumer. The Division of Water reserves the right to size or change the
size of any meter according to water use records of the consumer and the
recommendations of the American Water Works Association "Standard for Cold
Water Meters".  The customer is responsible for providing facilities for a
proper meter setting and for any required piping changes.
   (c)    All new water services shall be metered with a remote reading meter
and register after the passage of this chapter. Remote reading meters and
registers shall be installed on all existing water services unless determined
otherwise by the Director of Public Service. Remote reading meters will require
periodic inspection by the Division of Water. Failure of the customer or
consumer to comply with this rule may result in water service to the unit being
terminated in accordance with Section
941.12 (a), (f), (g) and (m).
   (d)    Upon request from an owner-customer and upon payment of the standard
test charge as established by Section
941.08(g), the Division of Water shall remove any meter to the meter shop for
test. If, upon examination and test, it is found that the meter registers
outside of the tolerance limits of the following percentages of water through
it, that is, two percent (2%) over or under on meter sizes five-eighths inch
thru two inches on flows from one to twenty gallons per minute, five percent
(5%) over or under on all other types and sizes of meters on flows from low to
high rating, then it shall be considered "inaccurate" and the water charges
will be adjusted upon basis of the test. 
   (e)    The standard charge for the replacement of frozen or stolen meter
shall be the current cost of the meter to the City of Mansfield plus the cost
of any auxiliary devices such as remote radios if necessary.
(Ord. 14-047.  Passed 4-15-14.)
   941.07  METER READINGS AND BILLS.
   (a)       Each water service account bill shall represent water used as
determined by an actual meter reading or an estimated reading based upon
previously used water at the same premises, or a minimum service charge. 
Estimated readings shall be noted as such on the bill.  Bills for each water
service account shall be mailed to the customer on a monthly basis.  Bills
shall be due in full on the fourteenth day after the bill date.  Failure to pay
a bill by the twenty-first day after said bill date will result in the
assessment of a ten percent (10%) late fee which shall appear on the next
monthly statement.  Failure to pay a bill on time, may be considered nonpayment
for the purposes of Section
941.12 (a), (f), (g) and (m).
            (1)     All payments to the Utility Collections Division shall be
in currency, by check or money order, credit or debit card, or other form of
online payment.  Any credit, debit, or other form of online payment may be
subject to a servicing or processing fee determined by the Utility Collections
Division. All checks will be accepted subject to collection at the bank.  In
the event a check is not honored by the bank and is returned for refund, the
account to which payment has been credited will be charged thirty-five dollars
($35.00) for the returned check.  Dishonored electronic funds transfer (EFT)
transactions will also be charged at the thirty-five dollar ($35.00) penalty.
            (2)     If a check has been received by the Utility Collections
Division that is returned by the bank as a dishonored check, upon notification
to the payor of the return of the dishonored check, the payor shall make
restitution on the dishonored check by making payment on the account as soon as
possible in cash, by cashier's check or money order, only.
            (3)     If a payor causes two dishonored checks to be presented to
the Utility Collections Division within a one year period, the Utility
Collections Division shall notify that payor in writing that payment for all
future water bills must be made in cash, by cashier's check or money order,
only.
 
   (b)       Meter readings will be taken in accordance with the water by-laws
as established by the Director of Public Service. Meter readings shall be taken
as near the same day of the month as possible. Meters must be installed in such
a location and manner so as to make them readily accessible for reading. If the
meter reader is unable to obtain a reading by reason of the meter or remote
register being out of order, or he is unable to gain access to either, an
estimated charge will be made. If authorized by the Director of Public Service,
a meter reading card may be sent to customers when their meter cannot otherwise
be read. Such cards shall be accurately marked by the customer to indicate the
true meter reading and returned to the Utility Collections Division. Returned
cards shall be considered as estimates only since actual water used shall be
determined by a reading taken by a City employee. If access to the meter or
remote register is not available for four consecutive months, notice will be
served upon the customer to take corrective action.
 
   (c)       Inspectors, meter readers or employees of the Division of Water
whose duty it may be to enter upon private premises to examine meters, pipes or
other fixtures used in connection with the City water supply shall be equipped
with a proper badge or such other credentials as the Director of Public Service
may deem necessary to identify them as agents of the Division of Water. Such
inspectors, meter readers or employees authorized by the Division of Water must
have free access at all reasonable hours to all parts of the building for the
purpose of inspecting meters, examining fixtures and observing the manner in
which the water is used. In case any authorized inspector, meter reader or
employee is refused admittance to any premises or is hindered or prevented from
making such inspection or reading, water service to the premises may be
terminated in accordance with Section
941.12 (a), (f), (g) and (m), and not turned on again until free access is
granted.
   (d)       Payment of water service accounts shall be deferred where the
customer established: an inability to pay a water bill by the date on which
such payment is due; and that termination of water service would be especially
dangerous to the health of a consumer at the unit as certified in writing by a
physician. Upon the establishment of both the foregoing conditions, payment
shall be deferred entirely for so long as both conditions exist, or for ninety
days, whichever occurs first. At the end of the deferment the customer shall be
required to pay the past due bill in full, or, at the customer's option, in
three equal monthly installment payments with each installment payment to be
made by the fifteenth day of the month; and the customer shall also be required
to pay the current bills for the water service account provided after the
deferment in accordance with the requirements of subsection (a) hereof. 
Successive deferments may be granted only upon either payment of all past due
amounts or upon the consent of the Director of Public Service. In the event
that the customer's application for an emergency deferment is initially
rejected by the City, or in the event that the City intends to terminate such a
deferment prior to the expiration of the ninety days, the City shall give the
customer written notice of the reason(s) therefor and of the opportunity for a
hearing, pursuant to Section
941.13,  at which he may contest the denial or the proposed termination of the
deferment. Whenever a customer requests a hearing pursuant to this paragraph to
contest a proposed termination, he shall not be obligated to pay the bill
unless and until he is ordered to do so by the decision of the hearing officer,
upon expiration of the ninety days, or upon prior settlement of the dispute,
whichever occurs first.
 
   (e)       In the event that a customer fails to make payment of a monthly
bill by the date it is due (see subsection (a) hereof) or fails to make either
a full or monthly payment after the cessation of an emergency deferment as
provided in subsection (d), the City may propose to terminate the water service
as provided by Section
941.12 (a), (f), (g) and (m).
   (f)     Customers have the right to request and attend a hearing for the
purpose of disputing: the amount of any charge assessed by the City against the
water service account of the customer; the amount of any credit accorded by the
City to the customer for prior payment on the water service account of the
customer; or the failure of the City to accord to customer a credit for prior
payment on the water service account of the customer. Any such hearing shall be
conducted by the City in accordance with Section
941.13  and shall be limited to matters concerning the two billings immediately
preceding the date of the request for hearing. Whenever a customer requests a
hearing pursuant to this subsection, he shall not be obligated to pay the
disputed portion of the bill unless and until, and only to the extent that he
is ordered to domino by the decision of the hearing officer or upon prior
settlement of the dispute.
   (g)   When water rents or charges are not paid when due, the Director of
Public Service shall cause them to be certified to the County Auditor for
placement as a lien upon the property served in accordance with the procedures
set forth in Ohio R.C. 743.04. Certification of delinquent water charges shall
be concurrent with certification of delinquent sewer charges as provided by
Section
937.14.
   (h)     Notwithstanding any other provision within this chapter, where water
service accounts are determined to be non-collectible by the Director of Public
Service, he may charge-off delinquent accounts in the categories set forth
below. In no event shall any account in any of the following categories be
charged-off from the account receivables unless and until the Director has,
after diligent effort, determined that the account cannot reasonably be
collected, after taking into consideration the age of the account, the
ownership of the premises served, the condition of the property, whether the
property is occupied or vacant, whether the property is improved or unimproved,
the expense of collection when compared to the amount due, any billing errors
on the part of the City, the adequacy of City records substantiating the
account and any other factors relevant to such determination.
     The Director shall maintain adequate records on each account which is
charged off, indicating the reason that each such account is deleted from the
account receivables.
     The procedures established by this subsection shall not be utilized as a
method of resolving disputed accounts in lieu of the procedures set forth in
Section
941.13,  but shall be for internal bookkeeping purposes only and in order to
remove uncollectible accounts from the City's files. The categories wherein the
Director is authorized to charge-off delinquent accounts are as follows:
            (1)       Water service accounts serving properties where the
structures thereon have been demolished and the accounts have not been removed
from the City's files.
            (2)       Water service accounts serving properties where the water
meter has been removed and billing records have not been adjusted accordingly.
          (3)       Flat rate sewer charges being billed after removal of the
structures on the property.
            (4)       Accounts older than six years and barred by the
applicable statute of limitations.

   941.12  TERMINATION OF SERVICE.
   (a)       The City may terminate water service to any premises, in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this section, for any of the
following reasons:
            (1)       Nonpayment of a bill for a water service account to the
premises; or
            (2)       Request of the customer; or
            (3)       Tampering with the water meter(s) for the premises by the
customer or consumer; or
            (4)       Failure to install remote reading meter(s) and register
(s); or
            (5)       Failure of the customer or consumer to permit the City
access to the meter(s); or
            (6)       Emergency termination as defined by subsection (1)
hereof; or
            (7)       For the purpose of water conservation in accordance with
subsection (b); or
            (8)     Breach of a tap-in agreement for outside the City users.
            (9)     Failure to install meters within ten days after purchase
and/or failure to have installed meter inspected.
   (b)       Water service to consumers may be terminated in accordance with
subsections (f), (g) and (m) hereof in the event that it is necessary to
conserve water.
   (c)   A water service account terminates upon the date of the termination of
water service and the removal of the meter from the premises, or upon the date
that a new water service account for water service to the premises is
established by some other person or entity, whichever occurs first.
   (d)       A customer may terminate his obligation on a water service account
without causing the termination of water service to the premises only if
another party establishes a water service account for the premises, pursuant to
this section, which commences on the date on which the water service account of
the customer terminates.
 
   (e)       A customer may voluntarily terminate the water service to a
premises. In such terminations the notice provisions of subsection (g) hereof
and the hearing provisions of Section
941.13 are applicable, unless no consumer resides at the premises or the
customer has obtained the written consent of each of the consumers residing at
the premises, or unless the emergency termination provisions of subsection (l)
are applicable. In determining whether or not any consumers reside at the
premises, the City has the right to rely upon the written affidavit of the
customer. If no consumer resides at the premises or the customer has obtained
the written consent of the consumer(s) residing at the premises, the customer
may secure termination of water service to a premises by notifying the Utility
Collections Division of the date on which he desires such water service to be
terminated. The customer may effect such notification by mailing a written
request to or by visiting the offices of the Utility Collections Division and
making an oral or a written request to an employee of the Utility Collections
Division. The customer shall be required to provide photo identification at the
time such request is made or the customer shall be required to mail a copy of
his/her photo identification to the Utility Collections Division.  Such
customers must provide to the Utility Collections Division an address to which
the City may mail a final water service bill, and must specify a termination
date which is at least five working days subsequent to the date on which the
customer has notified the Utility Collections Division of his desire to have
the water service terminated. Upon completion of the physical termination of
the utility services, the customer or his/her written designee shall sign and
date a document prepared by the City acknowledging the request for termination
has been completed to his/her satisfaction. The City shall read the water meter
and terminate the water service as near as possible to the requested date of
termination. A bill shall be prepared, mailed and become due at the next normal
billing period. In no case shall a bill for a fractional part of a billing
period be less than the minimum monthly charge.
 
   (f)       (1)   Prior to terminating water service to a customer, each of
the following conditions must be met, unless the customer and consumer(s), if
any, consent to the termination pursuant to subsection (e) hereof, or unless
the termination is initiated pursuant to subsection (1):
         A.       If the grounds for termination is nonpayment, the City shall
serve upon the customer no sooner than fourteen days after nonpayment as
defined in Section
 941.07 (a) and (e), a written notice of its intent to terminate the water
service supplied to the customer. In the event the grounds for termination are
other than nonpayment, the notice herein may be sent by the City when there is
reason to believe that such grounds exist. The written notice must have been
provided on Form A, as appended to original Ordinance 82-346. A written notice
shall, in this section, be referred to as the "termination notice".
         B.       The customer fails to do either of the following within
fourteen days of the termination notice served upon him:
                     1.     Cure the breach(es) of obligation for which the
City is authorized to terminate water service and concerning which the City has
notified the customer in the termination notice, including making restitution
on a dishonored check; or
                     2.       Request a hearing in accordance with subsection
(f)(2) hereof.
                 C.     In the event the customer has requested a hearing in
accordance with subsection (f)(2), the hearing officer has ruled in favor of
the City and the customer has failed within two working days of the service
date of the decision served upon him to cure the breach(es) of obligation found
by the hearing officer.
            (2)     A customer who receives a termination notice is entitled to
contest, at a hearing, the validity of the grounds set forth in the termination
notice, provided the customer requests a hearing within fourteen days of the
service date of the termination notice served upon him. The hearing provided by
the City pursuant to this subsection shall be conducted in accordance with
Section
941.13 .
            (3)     Payment on an account with a dishonored check shall be
deemed as a nonpayment and shall not alter the scheduled notice of termination
of water service if restitution is not made.  Payment of a termination notice
with a dishonored check will result in the immediate termination of water
service.
 
   (g)   (1)     Prior to terminating water service to a premises at which a
consumer who is not a customer resides, each of the conditions set forth in
subsection (f)(l) hereof and each of the following conditions must be met,
unless the consumer consents to the termination pursuant to subsection (e), or
unless the termination is initiated pursuant to subsection (1) hereof:
         A.     The City shall serve upon the consumer, no sooner than written
notice was served on the customer pursuant to subsection (f)(1)A. hereof, a
written notice of its intent to terminate the water service supplied to the
consumer. If the consumer resides in a single occupant structure or a dwelling
unit of a multi-occupant structure for which there is an individual water
meter, the written notice shall be provided on Form B. as appended to original
Ordinance 82-346. If the consumer resides in a dwelling unit of a multi-
occupant structure for which there is not an individual water meter, the
written notice shall be provided on Form C, as appended to original Ordinance
82-346. The written notice required by this subsection shall, in this section
be referred to as the "termination notice".
         B.     The consumer fails to do any of the following within fourteen
days of the service date of the termination notice served upon him:
            1.     Request a hearing in accordance with subsection (j); or
            2.     Cure the breach(es) of obligation claimed by the City as the
grounds for termination of water services, including making restitution on a
dishonored check.
            3.     Establish a payment account as provided in subsection (h)
hereof if there is an individual water meter.
                     4.     Establish a group payment account as provided in
(i) hereof if there is no individual water meter.
                 C.     In the event the consumer has requested a hearing in
accordance with subsection (j) hereof, the hearing officer has ruled in favor
of the City and the consumer has failed, within two working days of the service
date of the decision served upon him, to cure the breach(es) of obligation
found by the hearing officer.
            (2)     Payment on an account with a dishonored check shall be
deemed as a nonpayment and shall not alter the scheduled notice of termination
of water service if restitution is not made.  Payment of a termination notice
with a dishonored check will result in the immediate termination of water
service.
 
   (h)     In the event a consumer, who is not a customer, and who resides in a
single-occupant structure or dwelling unit of a multi-occupant structure for
which there is an individual water meter, receives a termination notice from
the City, such consumer may establish, in the customer's name, a payment
account.  The consumer shall be liable only for the cost of water and sewer
service supplied to the consumer subsequent to the date on which such account
has been established.  In order to establish an individual payment account, the
consumer must visit the offices of the Utility Collection Division during its
business hours and, at that time, an employee of the Utility Collections
Division shall provide the consumer the necessary forms hereof; the account
shall be deemed established when the consumer has submitted these forms,
properly completed, together with a security deposit of fifty dollars ($50.00)
to an employee of the Utility Collections Division.  The fifty dollars ($50.00)
shall be deposited in the Utility Guarantee Deposit Fund.  At the termination
of service, the deposit will be refunded, less any balance due for the final
bill.
 
   (i)     In the event a consumer, who is not a customer and who resides in a
dwelling unit of a multi-occupant structure for which there is no individual
water meter, receives a termination notice from the City, the consumer may
establish a group payment account for the entire multi-occupant structure. A
group payment account is a procedure by which the consumer(s) may maintain the
water service to the unit(s) by paying only the current monthly bill. The
burden of collecting any amounts in arrears remains with the City, and the
consumer(s) may exercise such legal remedies as are available to them. Amounts
sufficient to cover the current billing must be rendered to the Utility
Collections Division. The City is under no obligation to accept payment from
each individual consumer, but rather from one representative acting on behalf
of all of the consumers. One payment will be issued to the Utility Collections
Division and one receipt will be issued by the Utility Collections Division to
the consumer's representative rendering payment. In order to establish a group
payment account, the consumer or the consumer's representative must visit the
offices of the Utility Collections Division during its business hours and, at
that time, an employee of the Utility Collections Division shall provide the
consumer or the consumer's representative the necessary forms and assistance
for establishing the group payment account. The City may require the
representative to provide the names and addresses of all members establishing
the group payment account. For purposes of subsection (g) hereof, a group
payment account shall be deemed established when the consumer or the consumer's
representative has submitted these forms, properly completed, together with a
security deposit of two hundred dollars ($200.00), to an employee of the
Utility Collections Division, and the consumer or the consumer's representative
has tendered to the Utility Collections Division payment in the amount of the
current monthly bill.  The two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be deposited in
the Utility Guarantee Deposit Fund.  At the termination of service, the deposit
will be refunded, less any balance due for the final bill.  In the event the
consumers in a group payment account thereafter fail to tender timely a monthly
payment, the City may proceed to terminate the water service, subject to the
provisions of subsection (m) hereof.  In such circumstances, no other notice or
hearing is required.
     
   (j)     A consumer, who is not a customer and who receives a termination
notice, is entitled to contest, at a hearing, the validity of the grounds set
forth in the termination notice, provided the consumer requests a hearing
within fourteen days of the service date of the termination notice served upon
him, and further provided the consumer may not dispute the City's claim, if
any, of a delinquency in the water service account of the customer. The hearing
provided by the City pursuant to this paragraph shall be conducted in
accordance with Section
941.13.
   (k)   In the event a consumer, who is not a customer, receives a termination
notice from the City as a result of a delinquency in the water service account
of the customer, the consumer may pay the delinquent amount claimed by the City
and thereby avoid termination of the water service.
      
   (1)       In circumstances set forth in Section
941.02 (c) and in those situations in which it is necessary for the City to
terminate the water service to a unit in order to make repairs or to prevent
substantial damage, and where the pretermination requirements in subsections
(f), (g) and (m) hereof reasonably cannot be followed, the City may terminate
the water service to the unit immediately and without prior notice. In any such
case, if and when it is reasonably practicable to do so, the City shall provide
the customer and the consumer(s), if any, either individually or through the
media, notice of the reasons for the termination and of the estimated time at
which the water service will be restored. The pretermination notice provisions
of subsections (f), (g) and (m) shall not apply.
 
   (m)       In addition to any other notices required by this chapter, between
five and ten days prior to terminating the water service to a consumer, the
City shall serve the consumer a written notice of the date on or shortly after
which the water service will be terminated; however, this notice shall not be
required if the termination is at the request of the customer and consumer(s),
if any, pursuant to subsection (e) hereof, or the termination is initiated
pursuant to subsection (1). Except for emergency terminations, under subsection
(1), terminations of water service shall be conducted only during normal
business hours in compliance with the following provisions:
      (1)       No termination may be made after 12:30 p.m. on the day
preceding a day that all services necessary for the consumer(s) or customer to
arrange and the City to perform reconnection are not regularly performed, and
      (2)       Within twenty-four hours prior to termination of service, the
City will provide the consumer(s) with personal notice, or if the consumer is
not at home, written notice to the premises, prior to termination. In a multi-
unit structure, written notices shall be placed in conspicuous places. The
notice shall advise the consumer(s) of the termination and of the business
address and telephone number of the Utility Collections
         (Ord. 16-080.  Passed 5-3-16.)
   941.13  HEARINGS.
   (a)    Customers and consumers shall have the right to request a hearing
orally or in writing for the reasons and purposes set forth in this section.
The request for a hearing shall be made by the customer or consumer or person
acting on their behalf at the office of the Utility Collections Division to an
employee during regular business hours. The City reserves the right to require
that the applicant sign a request for hearing form. Whenever a customer or
consumer timely requests a hearing, regarding the right of the City to
terminate water service to a unit, the City shall not terminate the water
service during the pendency of the hearing, nor unless and until authorized to
do so by the decision of the Board of Utility Appeals or upon prior settlement
of the dispute. A consumer who is not a customer may not dispute at a hearing
the City's claim of a delinquency in the water service account of the customer.
   (b)    The customer/consumer shall be informed, in writing, by the City of
all standards and procedures pursuant to which the hearing will be conducted;
i.e., all of the standards and procedures set forth in this section. The
written notice shall be provided on Form D, as appended to original Ordinance
82-346, and shall be served upon the customer/consumer by the City within
thirty working days of the date on which the customer/consumer requested the
hearing.
   (c)    The customer/consumer shall be informed by the City of the date of
the hearing which shall be held within ten working days of the date on which
the customer/consumer requested the hearing, but not sooner than five working
days after the date on which the City served written notice of the hearing date
on the customer/consumer, unless the customer/consumer requests a continuance
of the original hearing date and there is good cause shown for this request.
When such continuances are granted, the original hearing date shall be
continued to a second date, which shall be within thirty working days of the
original hearing date.
   (d)    During regular business hours of the Utility Collection Division the
customer/consumer may, at any time prior to the hearing, inspect and copy at
his expense any records in the possession of the City which are relevant to the
issue about which a hearing has been requested. At least two working days prior
to the hearing date, the customer/consumer also may request of the Utility
Collections Division that the City test and/or read the water meter in issue,
and if so requested, the City shall honor the request, provided the customer/
consumer pays the test charge established by Sections
941.06(d) and
941.08(g).
   (e)    If both the City and the customer/consumer desire to have an informal
conference for the purpose of resolving the dispute for which a hearing has
been requested, the City and customer/consumer may hold such a conference, at a
mutually agreeable time and location, at any time prior to the hearing. Any
agreement reached by the City and the customer/consumer during an informal
conference shall be reduced to writing by the City and shall include, among
other things, the terms of the agreement, the signature of a representative
from the City and the customer/consumer, and if appropriate, a waiver of the
hearing requested by the customer/consumer. The Director of Public Service or
his authorized representative may correct, adjust or reduce a disputed bill at
an informal conference. In no case shall such correction, adjustment or
reduction be in excess of fifty percent (50%) of the amount billed or to less
than the minimum charge for the billing period, whichever is greater.  Any
adjustment correction or reduction shall be documented in writing setting forth
the specific reasons in support of the adjustment, correction or reduction.
   (f)    The hearing shall be conducted by the Board of Utility Appeals and
that Board shall be authorized to determine the amount of money, if any, owed
to the City under the water service account in issue, and any other relevant
issues in dispute; and shall be authorized to order continuation or termination
of water service or any other appropriate action within the authority of the
City. The decision of the Board shall be implemented through the Director of
Public Service.
   (g)   At the hearing, the customer/consumer shall have the right to be
represented by counsel, to be heard in person, to present witnesses and
documentary evidence, and to confront and cross-examine the City's witnesses.
   (h)    The Board of Utility Appeals' decision shall be made in writing
within five working days of the hearing date. It shall be based solely on the
evidence introduced at the hearing and shall state the rule(s) and evidence
relied upon to make the decision. A copy of the decision shall be served
immediately upon the customer/consumer.
   (i)   No person shall knowingly make a false statement or representation of
any fact on any application or document provided for in this chapter.

   971.06  FLASHING LIGHTS PROHIBITED; EXCEPTIONS.
   No person shall install or use any intermittently flashing light of any type
or color on any watercraft in use or operation on the waters of the City,
except that such flashing lights may be installed and used in an emergency to
attract attention to such an emergency for aid and relief of the distressed,
and except that a blue colored revolving or flashing horizontal beam of low
intensity located at any effective point on the forward exterior of the
watercraft may be displayed by authorized patrol boats when engaged in law
enforcement duties day or night on waters of this City.  (ORC 1547.03)
   971.07  SIREN PROHIBITED.
   No person, except an authorized representative of the Federal government,
the State or any of its political subdivisions shall use or operate a siren on

   971.08  OPERATING REGULATIONS; RISK OF COLLISION; RIGHT OF WAY.
   The following rules for preventing collisions shall be followed in the
navigation of all public and private watercraft operating upon the waters of
the City:
   (a)    Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail alone shall be
considered a sailboat. Every watercraft which is under way propelled by sail
and machinery shall be considered a powercraft. Every watercraft shall be
considered under way when it is not at anchor or made fast to the shore or
aground. In addition to any other situation, "risk of collision", shall be
determined to exist whenever the compass bearing of the approaching watercraft
remains substantially the same.
   (b)    When two sailboats are approaching one another so as to involve the
risk of collision, one of them shall yield the right of way to the other, as
follows, namely:
      (1)    A sailboat which is running free shall yield the right of way to
the sailboat which is close-hauled.
      (2)    A sailboat which is close-hauled on the port tack shall yield the
right of way to a sailboat which is close-hauled on the starboard tack.
      (3)    When both sailboats are running free, with the wind on different
sides, the sailboat which has the wind on the port side shall yield the right
of way to the other.
      (4)    When both sailboats are running free, with the wind on the same
side, the sailboat which is to the windward shall yield the right of way to the
sailboat which is to the leeward.
   (c)    When two powercraft are meeting end on, or nearly end on, so as to
involve the risk of collision, each shall alter its course to starboard, so
that each shall pass the other on the port side of the other.
   (d)   When two powercraft are crossing at right angles or obliquely, so as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft which has the other on its own
starboard side shall yield the right of way to the other.
   (e)    When a powercraft and a sailboat are proceeding in such directions as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft shall yield the right of way
to the sailboat, except when the sailboat is overtaking the powercraft.
   (f)    Every watercraft which is directed by these rules to yield the right
of way to another watercraft shall, on approaching such other watercraft, if
necessary, slacken its speed, stop, reverse or alter course. Where, by any of
the rules prescribed by this chapter one of two watercraft shall yield the
right of way, the other shall keep its course and speed.
   (g)    Notwithstanding anything contained in these rules, every watercraft
overtaking another shall yield the right of way to the overtaken watercraft.
Every watercraft coming up with another watercraft from any direction more than
twenty-two and one-half degrees abaft the other's beam, that is, at such a
position with reference to the watercraft which it is overtaking that at night
it would be unable to see either of the other's side or combination bow lights
is an overtaking watercraft; and no subsequent alteration of bearing between
the two watercraft shall make the overtaking watercraft a crossing watercraft
within the meaning of these rules, or relieve it of the duty of keeping clear
of the overtaken watercraft until it is finally passed and clear. If the
overtaking watercraft is in doubt as to whether it is forward of or abaft this
direction from the other watercraft, it should assume that it is an overtaking
watercraft and yield the right of way.
   (h)    In rivers and streams or other areas in which there is a water
current, the descending watercraft shall have the right of way over a
watercraft which is ascending.
   (i)    When a powercraft and a rowboat are proceeding in such direction as
to involve the risk of collision, the powercraft shall yield the right of way
to the rowboat.
   (j)    Watercraft leaving a dock, boat slip or tie-up space shall yield the
right of way to all watercraft approaching such dock, boat slip or tie-up
space.
   (k)    At all times the operator of a watercraft shall maintain a proper
lookout required by the ordinary practice of seamen and by the special
circumstances of the case.
   (l)    In obeying and construing these rules, due regard shall be given to
all dangers of navigation and collision and to any special circumstances which
may render a departure from the above rules necessary in order to avoid
immediate danger.
   971.09  CHILD OPERATORS; SUPERVISING PERSON.
   No person under twelve years of age shall operate any watercraft upon the
waters of the City unless such person is under the direct visual and audible
supervision, during such operation, of a parent, guardian or other person over
the age of sixteen years. No supervising parent, guardian or other person over
sixteen years of age shall permit any person under twelve years of age
operating a watercraft upon the waters of the City to violate any section of
this chapter or Ohio R.C. Chapter 1547.  (ORC 1547.06)
   971.10  RECKLESS OPERATION.
   No person shall operate any watercraft, or manipulate any water skis,
aquaplane or similar device upon the waters of the City carelessly or
heedlessly, or in disregard of the rights or safety of any person, watercraft
or property, or without due caution, at a rate of speed or in a manner so as to
endanger any person, watercraft or property.
(ORC 1547.07)
   971.11  OPERATION IN RESTRICTED AREAS.
   (a)    No person shall operate a watercraft within or through a designated
bathing area or within or through any area which has been buoyed off
designating it as an area in which watercraft are prohibited.
   (b)    No person shall operate a watercraft at greater than idle speed or at
a speed that creates a wake near any marina, boat docking facility, boat
gasoline dock, launch ramp, recreational boat harbor or harbor entrance or
within any area buoyed or marked as a no wake area.
   (c)    No person shall operate a watercraft in any area of restricted or
controlled operation in violation of the designated restriction.
   (d)    No person shall operate a watercraft within 150 feet of an official
diver's flag unless he is tendering the diving operation.
   (e)    All areas of restricted or controlled operation as described in
subsection (a) hereof, or as provided for in Ohio R.C. 1547.14 or 1547.61 shall
be marked by a buoy or sign designating the restriction. The specific areas
described in subsection (b) hereof shall be considered restricted areas without
being designated by a buoy or sign. All waters surrounded by or lying between
such a buoy or sign and the closest shoreline are thereby designated as an area
in which the designated restrictions shall apply in the operation of any
watercraft.
   Markings on a buoy or sign designating areas of restricted or controlled
operation shall be so spaced as to show all around the horizon. Lineal spacing
between such buoys or signs shall be such that under normal conditions of
visibility any such buoy or sign shall be readily visible from the next
adjacent buoy or sign. No colors or symbols, except as provided for in rules of
the Chief of the Division of Watercraft, shall be used for marking closed or
controlled areas of boating waters.
   The City is authorized to place such buoys or signs on its waters and may
apply to the Chief of the Division of Watercraft for permission to place such
buoys or signs on other waters within its territorial limits. (ORC 1547.08)
   971.12  MOORING PROHIBITED IN CERTAIN AREAS.
   No person shall moor or anchor any watercraft in a designated speed zone or
water ski zone. No person, unless in distress and no other watercraft or vessel
is endangered thereby, shall moor to, anchor to, or tie up to any marker, aid,
buoy, light or other aid to navigation.
(ORC 1547.09)
   971.13  OPERATING UNDER INFLUENCE OF ALCOHOL, DRUGS PROHIBITED; EVIDENCE.
   (a)    No person shall operate, be in physical control of any watercraft
underway or manipulate any water skis, aquaplane or similar device upon the
waters of this City, if any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person is under the influence of alcohol or a drug of abuse, or
the combined influence of alcohol and a drug of abuse;
      (2)    The person has a concentration of ten-hundredths of one percent
(0.10%) or more by weight of alcohol in his blood;
      (3)    The person has a concentration of fourteen-hundredths (0.14) of
one gram or more by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his urine;
      (4)    The person has a concentration of ten hundredths (0.10) of one
gram or more by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his breath.
   (b)    In any criminal prosecution for a violation of this section, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol or a drug of abuse in
the defendant's blood, urine or breath at the time of the alleged violation as
shown by chemical analysis of the defendant's blood, urine or breath, taken
within two hours of the time of the alleged violation.
   When a person submits to a blood test, only a physician, registered nurse or
qualified technician or chemist shall withdraw blood for the purpose of
determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content. This limitation does not
apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A physician, registered nurse
or qualified technician or chemist may refuse to withdraw blood for the purpose
of determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content if in his opinion the
physical welfare of the person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
   The blood, urine or breath shall be analyzed in accordance with methods
approved by the Ohio Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director of Health pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
   If there was at the time the blood, urine or breath was taken a
concentration of less than ten-hundredths of one percent (0.10%) by weight of
alcohol in the defendant's blood, less than fourteen hundredths (0.14) of one
gram by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of his urine or less than ten
hundredths (0.10) of one gram by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of his
breath, such fact may be considered with other competent evidence in
determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the result of the test shall
be made available to him, his attorney or agent immediately upon the completion
of the test analysis.
   The person tested may have a physician, registered nurse or qualified
technician or chemist of his own choosing administer a chemical test or tests
in addition to any administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer,
and shall be so advised. The failure or inability to obtain an additional test
by a person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the test
or tests taken at the direction of a law enforcement officer.
   A physician, registered nurse or qualified technician or chemist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section, and a hospital, first
aid station or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to
this section, is immune from criminal liability, and from civil liability that
is based upon a claim of assault and battery or based upon any other claim that
is not in the nature of a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in
withdrawing blood from the person. (ORC 1547.11)
   971.131 IMPLIED CONSENT.
   (a)   Any person who operates a vessel or uses any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device upon any waters of the City of Mansfield, shall be deemed to

for the purpose of determining its alcohol or drug of abuse content if arrested
for the offense of operating a vessel or using any water skis, aquaplane, or
similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11.  The test or tests shall be
administered at the direction of a law enforcement officer having reasonable
grounds to believe the person to have been operating a vessel or using any
water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11. 
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
   (b)   Any person who is dead, unconscious, or who is otherwise in a
condition rendering him incapable of refusal shall be deemed not to have
withdrawn consent provided by division (a) of this section and the test or
tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C. 313.12 to 313.16.
   (c)   Any person under arrest for the offense of operating a vessel or using
any water skis, aquaplane, or similar device in violation of Ohio R.C. 1547.11
or similar municipal ordinance, shall be advised of the consequences of his
refusal to submit to a chemical test designated by the law enforcement agency
as provided in division (a) of this section.  The advice shall be in a written
form prescribed by the Chief of the Division of Watercraft and shall be read to
the person.  The form shall contain a statement that the form was shown to the
person under arrest and read to him in the presence of the arresting officer
and either another law enforcement officer, civilian law enforcement employee,

1123.01(b)
   1111.01  STREETS.
   (a)    General. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade and
location of all streets shall conform to the Official Thoroughfare Plan or
subsequent amendments thereof, and shall be considered in their relation to
existing and planned streets, to topographical conditions, to public
convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses
of the land to be served by such streets. The subdivider shall provide within
the boundaries of the subdivision plat the necessary right of way for the
widening, continuance or alignment of such street in conformity with the
Thoroughfare Plan by one of the following methods:
      (1)    The dedication of the necessary right of way for the continuation,
extension or connection of any present or planned thoroughfare.
      (2)    When subdividing land fronting on an existing County or township
road not designated on the Thoroughfare Plan as of equal to or greater
importance than a secondary street, a dedication shall provide necessary right
of way or easements for traffic, utilities and drainage.
   (b)    Major Traffic Arteries and Physical Barriers.
      (1)    Traffic arteries. Where a subdivision abuts or contains an
existing or proposed street of equal or greater importance than a secondary
thoroughfare, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets,
reverse frontage with planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
rear property line or a planting strip of a minimum width of twenty feet on the
rear of the lots with no vehicular access across such strip, deep lots with
rear service alleys, or such other treatment as may be necessary for adequate
protection of residential properties and to afford separation of through and
local traffic.
      (2)    Physical barriers. Where a subdivision borders on or contains a
railroad right of way or limited access highway right of way, the Commission
may require a street approximately parallel to and on each side of such right
of way, at a distance suitable for necessary traffic circulation.
   (c)    Arrangement.
      (1)    Traffic. Minor streets shall be so laid out that their use by
through traffic will be discouraged.
      (2)    Access to adjacent property. The street layout shall make
provision for the proper protection and continence of streets into adjacent
unsubdivided acreage where it is deemed appropriate and desirable by the
Commission.
      (3)    Master Plan. Where the plat to be submitted includes only part of
the tract owned by the subdivider, the Commission shall require a sketch of a
tentative future street system for the unsubdivided portion.
   (d)    Alignment.
      (1)    Horizontal.
         A.    Jogs. Street jogs with centerline offsets of less than 125 feet
shall be avoided.
         B.    Angle of intersections. Streets shall be laid out so as to
intersect as nearly as possible at right angles and no street shall intersect
any other street at less than sixty degrees.
         C.    Intersection approaches. Approaches to street intersections
shall be straight for a distance of at least 100 feet from the centerline of
the street intersected.
         D.    Reverse curves. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be
introduced between reverse curves on all but minor and marginal access streets.
      (2)    Vertical.
         A.    Grade at intersection. Approaches to intersections shall be
reduced to grade not exceeding three percent (3%) for a distance of at least
100 feet. The Commission may modify this requirement when an unreasonable
hardship would result from the strict enforcement.
   (e)    Classification. Each street in a subdivision shall be classified and
shall be governed in accordance with the following table:
 
                                   Minimum      Max.      Minimum

   ** If separate drainage is necessary, the right of way shall be 50 feet.
   (f)    Corner Radii at Intersections. Property lines at street right-of-way
intersections shall be rounded with a radius of forty feet or of a greater
radius where the Commission may deem it necessary.
   (g)   Dead-End Streets.
      (1)    Permanent.
         A.    Dead-end streets (cul-de-sacs), designed to be so permanently,
shall not be longer than 600 feet and shall be provided at the closed end with
a turn-around having a street property line diameter of at least 100 feet. The
street right-of-way lines and the 100-feet diameter turn-around shall be joined
by tangent arcs which are of fifty-foot radius.
         B.    Where the street does not exceed 350 feet in length, a T-type
back-around terminus may be approved within a sixty-foot right of way.
      (2)    Temporary.
         A.    Where streets are extended to the boundary of a subdivision to
provide for their proper continuance at such time as the adjacent land is
subdivided, they may be terminated in the same manner as required for permanent
dead-end streets, of 350 feet or less.
         B.   If a street extends only one lot depth past a street
intersection, no turn-around is required.
   (h)    Half Streets.
      (1)    Half streets shall be prohibited except under one of the following
conditions:
         A.    The Commission finds it will be practicable to require the
dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining acreage is
subdivided.
         B.    There exists a half street which should logically be continued
to a reasonable intersection.
         C.    There exists a dedicated or platted half street adjacent to the
tract to be subdivided, the other half shall be platted if deemed necessary by
the Commission.
      (2)   Where a half street is permitted, the Commission shall require
provisions to prevent access from abutting property outside the subdivision
until the other half of the street is established as a public street.
         (Ord. 64-222.  Passed 9-15-64.)
   (i)    Private Streets.   Private streets shall meet all requirements for
public streets, except as specified for private streets in a single-family
residential development with lot sizes of one acre and larger in area.
   The Commission may require certain streets within a development to be public
if it is determined that the projected density necessitates the use of public
streets and that traffic connections to adjacent plats or developments are
required for adequate circulation.
(Ord. 83-143.  Passed 5-17-83.)
   1111.02  ALLEYS.
   (a)    Required. Alleys shall be provided in apartment, commercial and
industrial districts, except that the Commission may waive this requirement
where other definite and assured provision is made for service access such as
off-street loading, unloading and parking consistent with and adequate for the
uses proposed.
   (b)    Prohibited.  Alleys will not be allowed in one and two-family
districts except where it is desirable to continue an existing alley to the
nearest intersection or where the lots face a street shown on the Major
Thoroughfare Plan and provision has not or cannot be made for limited access on
such street.
   (c)    Width. The minimum width of an alley shall be twenty feet.
   (d)    Intersections. Alley intersections and sharp changes in alignment
shall be avoided, but where necessary, corners shall be cut off sufficiently to

   (b)    Length.  Blocks shall not exceed 1,320 feet in length except where
topographical conditions require longer blocks, nor shall they be less than 400
feet in length; blocks in excess of 900 feet in length shall require crosswalks
ten feet in width to be located at approximately the center.
   (c)    Width. Blocks shall contain two rows of lots except where double and
reverse frontage lots are allowed.  (Ord. 64-222.  Passed 9-15-64.)
   1111.04  LOTS.
   (a)    General.   The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation shall be
appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development
and use contemplated in order to secure and provide for the proper arrangement
of streets or other highways in relation to existing or planned streets or
highways or to the regional plan for adequate and convenient open spaces for
traffic, utilities, access of fire-fighting apparatus, recreation light, air
and for the avoidance of congestion of population.
      (1)    Lots shall meet all lawful requirements as adopted by the various
governmental subdivisions or public agencies having jurisdiction over this
problem.
      (2)    The minimum lot width, at the building line shall be sixty feet.
      (3)    No lot depth shall exceed three and one-half times the lot width.
   (b)    Corner Lots. Corner lots for residential use shall have extra width
if necessary to permit an appropriate building setback from and orientation to
both streets.
   (c)    Ingress and Egress. The subdividing of land shall be such as to
provide each lot with frontage on a public street.
   (d)    Double and Reverse Frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage
lots may be allowed where they are essential to provide separation of
residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific
disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at
least twenty feet, and across which there would be no right of access should be
provided along the line of lots abutting such traffic artery or other
disadvantageous use. Such easements should be owned and maintained by adjacent
property owners but adequately protected through restrictions.

minimum building setback line of thirty-five feet measured from the right-of-
way line.
         B.    Primary roads 100 feet in width shall have a minimum building
setback line of forty feet measured from the right-of-way line.
         C.    The building setback line for all lots fronting on streets or
roads having a width of more than 100 feet, such as expressways or super
highways, shall be determined by the Planning Commission.
      (3)    Transition. Where a building setback line established under
subsection (f)(l) or (2) hereof is more or less than that established on
contiguous property on the same street, there may be a gradual transition at
the rate of two and one-half feet per lot from the existing to the new.
      (4)    Parcels exempted from platting. Where lots fronting on an existing
public street are split or subdivided without a plat, there shall be a building
setback line not less than that which would be required if the land were
platted.
      (5)    Corner lots.  The minimum building setback line on any street not
having lots fronting upon it shall be twenty-five feet from the required right-
of-way or easement line. Where the street on the side of a corner lot has lots
fronting upon it within the same block on the same side of the street, the
building setback on the side of the corner lot shall conform to the setback
requirements of such street.
         (Ord. 64-222.  Passed 9-15-64.)
   (g)    Zero Lot Line - Common Wall Residences.   When zoning regulations

jurisdiction. All typical sections and major engineering details to be used on
any particular road, street or alley shall be approved in advance by the
engineer of jurisdiction or his representative before completion of the
construction plans.
   When the subdivider or developer submits, for approval, a construction plan
for street improvements for a part of a proposed subdivision area, preliminary
street grades and proposed drainage facilities for the entire subdivision area
shall also be presented.
   Where deemed desirable the engineer of jurisdiction or his representative
may require the construction of improvements in or vacation of part or all of
any intersection roads, streets or alleys in order to assure that no hardships
of added expense be endured by abutting property owners or the local governing
body at some future date.
   All materials and construction procedure shall be in accordance with the
improvement standards herein and shall be approved in advance by the engineer
of jurisdiction or his representative.
   (a)    Subdividers Agreement, Performance Bond and Inspection Fee. Before
any subdivision plat or construction plan is given final approval, the
subdivider or developer shall have executed a performance bond for the amount
of the estimated construction cost, and an inspection fee for the amount of the
estimated inspection cost shall be deposited with the engineer of jurisdiction
before authorization of any construction plans. Any excess fee shall be
returned on completion.
   (b)    Drawings. The construction drawings shall be made with India ink or
some other equally substantial and distinct material from which clear and
legible prints may be obtained. Freehand linear drawing must not be attempted,
nor should other principles of good surveying, engineering or draftsmanship be
offended. The sheets upon which the construction drawings are made shall
measure either eighteen inches by twenty-four inches or twenty-four inches by
thirty-six inches. A poorly drawn or illegible plan is sufficient cause for
rejection.
   (c)    Title of the Plan. The title of the plan must contain the name of the
subdivision, road or street names, township, county and location plat. Space
shall be provided on the title sheet or the first sheet of the plan for
approval by the proper authorities.
   (d)   Typical Sections. The typical sections shall meet the current
requirements as set forth and the engineer of jurisdiction may require that any
typical section, which may be contiguous to a proposed section or existing
section, within the corporate limits of the City, be of the same type and
design as that of the City. Curb or curb and gutter shall be required as part
of any road or street construction. Sidewalks shall be provided unless waived
by the Planning Commission.
   (e)    Plan and Profile. The plan view shall be drawn to a scale of 1" =
50', or larger. The plan view shall show the proposed road, street or alley
alignment, right-of-way and pavement widths, centerlines, bearing, stationing,
curve or radius data, existing and proposed drainage. Any other significant
feature or factor, shall also be shown on the plans. The centerline of road,
street or alley construction shall coincide with the centerline of the right of
way.
      The profile view shall have a horizontal scale equal to the plan scale
and a vertical scale of 1" = 5', or larger. The existing and proposed
centerline profile, elevations, gradient, existing and proposed drainage lines
and vertical curves shall be shown. The maximum street gradient shall be 0.
50%. Any change from same shall be with the approval of the engineer of
jurisdiction or his representative. When establishing road, street or alley
gradients, fullest consideration shall be given to the abutting property.
      Vertical curves shall be used at all points on the gradient where the
algebraic difference is one percent (1%) or greater. The minimum length of any
vertical curve shall be 100 feet. The minimum non-passing sight distance shall
be 200 feet on vertical curves.
   The following Engineer's certificate shall be placed on subdivision
improvement plans in accordance with this section.

system.
   The storm water in the drainage system shall be determined by the subdivider
using a ten-year storm frequency and suitable run off factors for completed
development both within the subdivider's property and all lands upstream from
the subdivider's property. If the design storm flow is calculated in an amount
which can be conducted adequately by a forty-eight inch conduit or less, then
the developer shall install a conduit of sufficient capacity up to forty-eight
inches in size to conduct this drainage on and through the subdivider's
property. If the design flow is calculated in amount in excess of the capacity
of a forty-eight inch conduit, then the subdivider must provide a conduit or an
open drainage channel treatment designed as follows:

or smooth interior corrugated polyethylene storm sewer pipe. The minimum
diameter shall be not less than twelve inches. Where special drainage designs
are necessary such as masonry or concrete structures, etc., such designs in
detail shall be submitted to the engineer of jurisdiction for approval in
advance of the completion of the construction plans.
   (b)    Flood Plain. If any portion of the land within the subdivision is
subject to inundation or flood hazard by a storm water, such fact and that
portion shall be clearly indicated on the subdivision plat. Land subject to
flooding shall not be platted for residential occupancy or for other such uses
which may increase the danger to health, life or property or may aggravate the
flood hazard.
   (c)   Intersection. The minimum curb radius shall be twenty-five feet
measured to the back of curb. An area of clear vision free of shrubbery, trees
and all other obstructions at street intersection shall be provided.

thickness of Portland cement concrete except at drives the thickness shall
conform to the drive thickness. The sidewalk shall be a minimum of four feet
wide. The inside edge shall normally be placed at least five feet from the face
of curb and the outside edge no closer than one foot to the right-of-way line.
   (f)    Underdrains. Six-inch diameter pipe underdrains installed a minimum
of three feet below subgrade shall be required under all pavement in order to
provide satisfactory subgrade drainage.  The estimate of quantities shall
include the necessary materials to provide this underdrain under all pavement.
   (g)    Guard Rail and Seeding, etc. The necessity of guard rail, seeding,
type of backfill or other special conditions, shall be determined with the
assistance of the engineer of jurisdiction or his representative before
completion of the construction plan.
   (h)    Cul-de-sac. The paved area within the circular space at the
termination of the cul-de-sac shall have a minimum radius of thirty-five feet.
   (i)    T-Turn Arounds. T-turn arounds may be required by the City Planning
Commission as a temporary measure at the end of streets where a future
extension is anticipated into adjacent land.
   The location and design of T-turn arounds shall be determined with the
assistance of the engineer of jurisdiction or his representative. The T-turn
arounds shall extend the entire width of the right of way and shall have a
minimum width of fifteen feet along the property line with the flared portions
rounded by a minimum radius of fifteen feet.
(Ord. 06-282.  Passed 12-19-06.)

accordance with the "Material Details" of the current volume of the
"Construction and Material Specifications", State of Ohio, Department of
Transportation. The materials will be referred to by material grade or section
number of the same current volume.
   (b)    Field Construction and Engineering. All items of work covered and
stipulated in the construction plans, altered or extra work shall be performed
in accordance with the lines, grades, typical cross sections and dimensions
shown on the construction methods set forth in the State of Ohio Department of
Transportation "Construction and Material Specifications". All streets shall be
graded the full width of the right of way. The setting and marking of all line,
profile and grade stakes necessary for the proper prosecution of the work in
accordance with the construction plans will be performed only by an authorized
engineer or surveyor. Should any misunderstanding arise, as to the intent or
meaning of the construction plans, or any discrepancy appear in same, or in the
proper method of setting and marking of the construction stakes, the decision
of the engineer of jurisdiction in such cases shall be final.
   (c)    Inspection.  Inspection of the work shall be made by the engineer of
jurisdiction or his representative. Forty-eight hours notice will be required
before any work of inspection takes place. Failure to comply with the above may
result in the rejection of the work and the project. Failure to reject any
defective work or materials shall not in any way prevent later rejection when
such defects are discovered, or obligate the governing body to final
acceptance. All costs of inspection shall be charged against the developer.
(Ord. 73-499.  Passed 12-18-73.)

   1129.01  PLAN SEQUENCE.
   Normally, a sketch plan, a preliminary plan with a key map of surrounding
streets, allotments, etc., and a subdivision plat will all be required and
should be submitted in the sequence named. (see also Chapter
1131.)
(Ord. 64-222.  Passed 9-15-64.)
   1129.02  SUBDIVISIONS INVOLVING FIVE LOTS OR LESS.
   Whenever a division of a parcel of land shown as a unit on the last
preceding tax roll (duplicate) is proposed along an existing public street, not
involving the opening, widening or extension of a street or road, and involving
no more than five lots after the original tract has been completely subdivided,
the division may be submitted to the Planning Commission for approval without a
plat. If the Commission, acting. through its staff, is satisfied that such
proposed division is not contrary to applicable platting, subdividing or zoning
regulations, and contains adequate dedication of public right of way, and has
adequate frontage on a dedicated and accepted public street, it shall within
seven working days after submission, approve such proposed division. On
presentation of a conveyance of such parcel, the same shall be stamped,
"Approved, City Planning Commission", and signed by a member of the staff.
   (a)    A drawing, based on a survey showing location of property and giving
such other information as may be necessary, shall be required.
   (b)    The following statement shall appear on each deed which is to be
executed. "The grantor, grantee and all subsequent owners or assignees taking
title from, under or through the grantor or grantee agrees that any use or
improvement made on this land shall be in conformity with all existing valid
zoning, platting, health or other lawful rules and regulations.
      (Ord. 64-222.  Passed 9-15-64.)

applicant may agree to, the Commission acting through its staff shall inform
the subdivider that the plans and data as submitted or as modified do or do not
meet the objectives of the Code. If the plans and data do not meet the
objectives of the Code the staff shall express the reasons therefor.
   (b)    Preliminary Plan.
      (1)    General. On reaching conclusions, informally as recommended in
subsection (a) hereof, regarding his general program and objectives, the
subdivider shall have prepared a preliminary plan, together with plans and
other supplementary material as specified in Chapter
1131.
         (Ord. 64-222. Passed 9-15-64.)
      (2)    Filing. Five copies of the preliminary plan and supplementary
material specified shall be submitted to the Commission with written
application for conditional approval and shall be accompanied by a preliminary
plan review fee in the amount of thirty dollars ($30.00). If time is not of
essence, the subdivider may submit two copies provided he agrees, in writing,
to an additional five days beyond the provisions of subsection (b) (3) hereof.
(Ord. 91-048. Passed 2-5-91.)
      (3)    Approval. The Commission, with the assistance of the staff, shall
within fifteen working days or within such further time as the applicant may
agree to, review the preliminary plan and other material submitted for
conformity thereof to this Subdivision Code. The. Commission shall recommend
to, and negotiate with the subdivider, changes deemed advisable. The staff
shall inform the subdivider as to which public offices must be contacted by him
to determine the extent and nature of the improvements required by this Code.
         A.    Upon completion of the review, the action, recommendations and
negotiation results of the Commission shall be noted on two copies of the
preliminary plan, referenced and attached to any conditions determined. One
copy shall be retained by the Commission and the other returned to the
subdivider.
         B.    Conditional approval of the preliminary plan shall not
constitute approval of the subdivision plat. Rather it shall be deemed an
expression of approval to the layout as returned to the subdivider, on the
preliminary plan as a guide to the preparation of the subdivision plat which
will be submitted for approval of the Commission, and for recording upon
fulfillment of the requirements of this Code and the conditions of the
conditional approval, if any.
      (4)    Improvements. If the subdivider or developer wishes to install his
improvements before the subdivision plat is recorded, he shall comply with the
requirements of both the preliminary plan and the subdivision plat.
Certification by a registered engineer or registered surveyor that improvements
have been built to plans and specifications filed with and approved by the
engineer of jurisdiction shall then accompany the subdivision plat when
submitted for final approval in lieu of plans, profiles and specifications.
   (c)    Subdivision Plat.
      (1)    General. The subdivision plat shall conform to the preliminary
plan except where changes are agreed upon between the Commission and the
subdivider, and it may constitute only that portion of the approved preliminary
plan which the subdivider proposes to record and develop at the time, provided
that such portion conforms with all the requirements of this Code. (Ord. 64-
222.  Passed 9-15-64.)
      (2)    Filing. The subdivision plat shall be filed with the Commission
not later than twelve months after the date of conditional approval of the
preliminary plan and shall be accompanied by a final plat review fee in the
amount of fifty dollars ($50.00), otherwise it will be considered void unless
an extension is requested by the developer and granted by the Commission. The

   1151.01  TITLE.
   This Title Three and Five shall be known as and may be referred to as the
"Zoning Ordinance of the City of Mansfield, Ohio".
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1151.02  AUTHORIZATION.
   This Zoning Ordinance is enacted under Ohio R.C. 713, governing the
incorporated parts of the City.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1151.03  LEGISLATIVE PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this Zoning Ordinance is to regulate and restrict the
location and use of buildings, structures and land for commercial, industrial,
residential, public and quasipublic uses or other specified uses; to regulate
the height and bulk of buildings and other structures; to regulate and
determine the area and dimensions of yards, courts and other open spaces; to
regulate and limit the density of population; to provide standards for all
types of dwelling units so that all residents may have access to decent, safe
and sanitary housing in accordance with the Federal Housing Act of 1949; to
lessen the danger and congestion of traffic on City streets and highways,
limiting excessive numbers of intersections, driveways and access points; to
provide adequate privacy, light and air; to protect the tax base facilitating
cost-effective development within the City; to protect landowners from adverse
impacts of adjoining developments; to conserve the values of property
throughout the City; to divide the City into districts, establishing the
boundaries thereof; to provide for changes in the regulations and boundaries of
such districts; to define certain terms used herein; to provide for the
administration and enforcement of the Ordinance; and to establish a Planning
Commission and define the powers and duties of such Commission.
(Ord. 06-019.  Passed 1-17-06.)
   1151.04  INTERPRETATION.
   (a)   This Zoning Ordinance shall be interpreted, whenever an administrative
board or the judiciary is called upon to do so, in conformance with the purpose
intended to be served by its enactment.  The intent of the standards and
supporting definitions is to protect both individual property owners and the
general public from adverse impacts which might otherwise be the result of a
proposed use.  To this end, those called upon to interpret this Ordinance shall
proceed as follows: determine the public purpose(s) of the standard(s) with
respect to which an interpretation is required; determine the actual impact of
a proposed interpretation; determine that the proposed interpretation will
ensure a just balance between the rights of the landowner and all others who
will be affected by that individual land use proposal.
   (b)   In the interpretation and application, the provisions of this
Ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety, comfort, convenience or general
welfare.  It is not intended by this Ordinance to repeal, abrogate, annul or in
any way impair or interfere with any existing provision, law or ordinance, or
with any rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or issued or which
shall be adopted or issued pursuant to the laws and regulations governing the
use of buildings or premises; provided, however, that where this Ordinance
provides greater restriction than is required by existing ordinances, rules,
regulations or permits, the provisions of this Ordinance shall control.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1151.05  VALIDITY AND SEPARABILITY.
   It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent of this Zoning Ordinance
that if any provisions of this Ordinance, or the application thereof to any
zoning lot, building or other structure, or tract of land, are declared by a
court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or ineffective in whole or in
part, or to be inapplicable to any person, firm, corporation or situation, the
effect of such decision shall be limited to the provision or provisions which
are expressly stated in the decision to be invalid or ineffective to the zoning
lot, building or other structure, or tract of land immediately involved in the
controversy.  All other provisions of this Ordinance shall continue to be
separate and fully effective, and the application of any such provision to
other persons or situations shall not be effected.

(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1159.03  DUTIES.
   For the purpose of this Zoning Ordinance, the Planning Commission shall have
the following duties and powers:
   (a)   Initiate proposed amendments to this Ordinance;
   (b)   Review all proposed amendments to this Ordinance in accordance with
Chapter
1161 and make recommendations to Council;
   (c)   Review all planned unit developments and make recommendations to
Council in accordance with Chapter
1185.
   (d)   Review all site plans whenever specifically required elsewhere in this
Ordinance.
   (e)    Review site plans and storm drainage plans for any multifamily or
nonresidential development of previously undeveloped land if a variance or
conditionally permitted use approval is required.
   (f)   Review any site plan for any development when deemed necessary by the
Zoning Administrator, particularly where such development would result in an
increase in impervious surface on the lot, an increase in the need for off-
street parking or would have an impact on traffic flow or circulation in the
immediate area.
   (g)   Hear and decide all appeals from any decision or action of the Zoning
Administrator or any other administrative official in carrying out or enforcing
any provisions of this Ordinance.
   (h)   Where there are practical difficulties or unnecessary or particular
hardships in carrying out the strict letter of this Ordinance, the Commission
shall have the power, upon appeal, to authorize a variance from the strict
application of the provisions of this Ordinance where evidence is submitted
showing that:
      (1)   By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape or area of
a specific piece of property, or by reason of exceptional topographic
conditions or other extraordinary physical land conditions applying to the
property involved or the intended use or development of the property that does
not generally apply to other properties or uses within the same zoning district
or neighborhood, the strict application of the provisions of this Ordinance
would result in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardship inconsistent
with the general purpose and intent of this Ordinance; and
      (2)   Granting of such variance will not be of substantial detriment to
the public interest or to property or improvements in such district in which
the variance is sought, and will not materially impair the purpose of this
Ordinance.  In granting a variance, the Commission may attach such conditions
or safeguards as it deems necessary to protect the public health, safety or
welfare and to further the purposes and intent of this Ordinance.
   (i)   Permit uses not expressly permitted under this Ordinance, if they are
similar in nature to permitted or conditionally permitted uses.
   (j)   Permit one- and two-family dwellings in any district if it can be
demonstrated that such use is in keeping with the character of the area and
would not be detrimental to future expansion of nonresidential uses in the
district.
      (Ord. 06-019.  Passed 1-17-06.)
   1159.04  APPEALS.
   Appeals, pursuant to Section
1159.03(g) and (h), may be taken by any person, firm or corporation, deeming
himself or itself to be adversely affected by the decision of the Zoning
Administrator regarding the interpretation of this Zoning Ordinance.  An appeal
shall be made no later than fifteen calendar days after the date on which the
Zoning Administrator makes his decision which causes such appeal to be made and
shall be accompanied by a fee in the amount of sixty-five dollars ($65.00),
which fee shall be refunded if the Zoning Administrator’s decision is wholly
reversed.  An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the administrative officer, whose decision is being
appealed, certifies to the Commission, after the notice of appeal has been
filed, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his
opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.  Within its powers, the
Commission may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be done, and
to that end shall have all the powers of the officers and bodies from whom the
appeal was taken and it may issue or direct the issuance of a certificate.
(Ord. 13-013.  Passed 1-15-13.)
   1159.05  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   All appeals and applications made to the Commission shall be in
writing and on forms prescribed therefor.  Every appeal or application for a
variance shall refer to the specified provision of the Zoning Ordinance
involved and shall exactly set forth the interpretation that is claimed, the
use for which the certificate is sought or the details of the appeal, and the
grounds on which it should be granted, as the case may be.  Each and every
decision made by the Commission shall be by resolution and shall contain a full
record of the findings of the Commission in the particular case.  Each such
resolution shall be filed with the City Building and Codes Department by case
number.
   (b)   When a notice of appeal has been filed in the proper form with the
Commission, the secretary shall immediately place the request for appeal upon
the calendar for hearing and shall cause notices, stating the time, place, date
and purpose of the hearing to be served personally or by mail, addressed to the
parties making the request for appeal at least ten days prior to the date of
the scheduled hearing.  Notices of the hearing shall also be sent to the owners
of all property bounding and abutting upon the land which is the subject of
appeal.  The Commission, at its discretion, may send out further notices to
publicize such hearings.
   The Commission may recess hearings from time to time, and if the time and
place of the continued hearing are publicly announced at the time of
adjournment, no further notice shall be required.

property, and does not violate the spirit and purpose of these preservation
regulations, then the Commission secretary shall issue the certificate of
approval.
   (f)   If the Commission determines that the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition will have an adverse effect on the
Historic District or listed property, and does violate the spirit and purposes
of these preservation regulations, then the Commission shall deny issuance of
the certificate of approval.
   (g)   In the event that the Commission determines within the thirty-day
review period that a certificate of approval shall not be issued, it shall
forthwith state in its records reasons for such determination and may include
recommendations respecting the proposed construction, reconstruction,
alteration or demolition of any area, place, building, structure, site, object
or work of art.  The secretary of the Commission shall forthwith notify the
applicant of such determination and transmit to him a certified copy of the
reasons for denial and recommendations, if any, of the Commission.
   (h)   Upon denying a certificate of approval, the Commission shall impose a
waiting period of at least thirty days, but not to exceed six months from the
date of disapproval, during which time the Commission shall negotiate with the
owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable to
both.  The first meeting between Commission and applicant shall be held within
thirty days from the date of disapproval.  If a compromise proposal is accepted
by both parties, the Commission may henceforth issue a certificate of approval.
   (i)   In the case of denial of a certificate of approval for demolition:
      (1)   The Commission and applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find a means of
preserving the property.  The Commission and applicant shall investigate the
feasibility of all means of preserving the listed property.  If the Commission
and applicant do not agree on a means of preserving the structure at the
initial meeting, then they shall continue to undertake meaningful and
continuing discussions for the purpose of finding a method of saving the
structure and such good faith meetings shall be held at least every forty-five
days after the initial meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Commission in good faith in
the time specified, then the Commission's denial of the application shall
stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Commission, the Commission determines that failure to issue a
certificate of approval will create a substantial hardship to the applicant and
that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment to the public
welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of this chapter,
then and in such event, the secretary of the Commission shall issue a
certificate of approval for such proposed demolition.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Commission, no alternative property use is developed or no
offer to save the structure is made by the applicant, the Commission or a third
party, then the applicant may appeal the decision to Council.  Council may
affirm or reverse the Commission's decision.  If Council affirms the decision,
the denial of certificate of approval shall stand.
   (j)   In the case of denial of a certificate of approval for construction,
reconstruction or alteration:
      (1)   The Commission and the applicant shall undertake meaningful and
continuing discussion during the waiting period in order to find an alternative
to incompatible new construction, reconstruction or alteration within a
Historic District or to a listed property.  If the Commission and applicant do
not agree on an alternative solution at the initial meeting, then they shall
continue to undertake meaningful discussions for the purpose of seeking a
compromise solution and such good faith meetings shall be held at least every
forty-five days after the initial meeting.
      (2)   If the applicant fails to meet with the Commission in good faith in
the time specified, then the Commission's denial of the application shall
stand.
      (3)   If, after holding such good faith meeting in the waiting period
specified by the Commission, the Commission determines that failure to issue a
certificate of approval will create a substantial hardship to the applicant and
that such certificate may be issued without substantial detriment to the public
welfare and without substantial derogation from the purposes of this chapter,
then and in such event, the secretary of the Commission shall issue a
certificate of approval for such proposed construction, reconstruction, or
alteration.
      (4)   If, after holding such good faith meetings in the waiting period
specified by the Commission, no alternative solution to incompatible
construction, reconstruction or alteration is reached, then the applicant may
appeal the decision to Council.  Council may affirm or reverse the Commission's
decision.  If Council affirms the decision, the denial of certificate of
approval shall stand.  (Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)

   1177.01  PURPOSE.
   Within the districts established by this Zoning Ordinance or amendments that
may later be adopted, there exist lots, structures and uses of land and
structures which were lawful before this Ordinance was passed or amended, but
which would be prohibited, regulated or restricted under the terms of this
Ordinance or future amendment.  Council declares that nonconforming uses and
structures are incompatible with permitted uses in the districts involved and
shall not be enlarged, expanded or extended, nor shall they be used as grounds
for adding other structures or uses prohibited by this Ordinance.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1177.02  NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD.
   In any district permitting residential uses, one-family and two-family
dwellings may be erected on any single lots of record existing at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance, even though such lot
fails to meet the requirements for minimum area and/or width that are
applicable in the district, providing that the yard setbacks and other
requirements not involving the area and width of the lot shall conform to the
regulations for the district in which such lot is located.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1177.03  NONCONFORMING USES OF LAND, BUILDINGS OR STRUCTURES.
   The lawful use of any land, building or structure existing at the effective
date of adoption or amendment of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued
although such use does not conform with the regulations of this Ordinance,
providing the following provisions are met:
   (a)   A nonconforming use shall not be extended, enlarged or increased to
occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of this
Ordinance.  The extension of a lawful use to any portion of a nonconforming
structure which existed prior to the enactment of this Ordinance, shall not be
deemed to be the extension of such nonconforming use.
   (b)   Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for a period of two
years or longer, such discontinuance shall be considered as conclusive evidence
of an intention to abandon the nonconforming use.  At the end of such two-year
period, any subsequent use of land shall conform to the provisions of this
Ordinance for the district in which such land is located.
   (c)   Nonconforming uses established after the effective date of this
Ordinance shall be declared as illegal nonconforming uses and shall be
discontinued within twenty days following the date of inspection by the Zoning
Administrator or any of his deputies.
      (Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   (d)   Any nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use of
the same or a more restrictive classification than the existing use upon
approval by the Planning Commission.  The Commission may attach any conditions
to the new use which it deems necessary to safeguard the public health, safety
or welfare.
      (Ord. 06-019.  Passed 1-17-06.)
   (e)   Where a nonconforming use of a building or structure exists, the
voluntary removal or voluntary destruction of the building or structure shall
eliminate the nonconforming status of the land.
      (Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1177.04  NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES.
   A lawful structure existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment
of this Zoning Ordinance may be continued although such structure does not
conform to the area, height or yard provisions of the district in which it is
located, providing the following provisions are met:
   (a)   Enlargements.  A nonconforming structure may not be added to or
enlarged unless the additions or enlargements are made to conform to the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (b)   Relocation.  A nonconforming structure shall not be moved to any other
lot or to any other portion of the lot on which it is presently situated unless
as a result of the move, the structure shall conform to the regulations of the
district in which it will be located after the move.
(c)   Enlargements.  A nonconforming building or structure, except for a two-
family dwelling or a multifamily or townhouse dwelling, which is damaged or
partially destroyed by any reason to the extent of not more than fifty percent
(50%) of its value at that time, may be restored without increase in
nonconformity, and the occupancy or use of such building, structure or part
thereof, which existed at the time of such partial destruction, may be
continued or resumed, provided such restoration is started within a period of
one year and is diligently prosecuted to completion.  In the event such damage
or destruction exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the value of such nonconforming
building or structure, no repair or reconstruction shall be made unless every
portion of such building or structure is made to conform to all regulations for
new buildings and structures in the district in which it is located.  A
nonconforming two-family dwelling or a nonconforming multi-family or townhouse
dwelling which is accidentally or involuntarily damaged or destroyed may be
restored without increase in nonconformity, such as size, setbacks, location,
height, density, occupancy, use or otherwise, which existed at the time of such
damage or destruction, provided such restoration to be commenced is started
within a period of one year and is substantially completed within two years.

health, safety and public welfare of the community.
   (b)   Ordinary repairs and the replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures,
wiring or plumbing may be done on any building or part thereof devoted to a
nonconforming use provided the size of the building is not increased.
   (c)   Nothing in this Ordinance shall prohibit the completion or
construction and use of a nonconforming building, structure or use for which a
zoning certificate has been issued prior to the effective date of adoption or
amendment of this Ordinance, provided construction is commenced within thirty
days after the issuance of such certificate; and that the entire building or
structure is completed within one year from the date the certificate was

   1179.01  OFF-STREET PARKING REGULATIONS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this section is to require off-street parking
spaces and loading spaces for all land uses sufficient in number to accommodate
all vehicles which will be congregated at a given location at a given point in
time by drivers and passengers who use or occupy the facility for which the
parking space is provided; to the end that on-street parking will be
diminished, traffic and pedestrian safety enhanced, property values stabilized
and the general welfare promoted. 
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   (b)   General Regulations.  In all districts, except the Central Business
District, in conjunction with the erection or enlargement of every building or
structure, off-street parking space shall be provided with adequate access to
each space.  In connection with all permitted uses, off-street parking spaces
shall be provided before a certificate of occupancy shall be issued, and shall
further be constructed in accordance with the following regulations:
      (1)   Any area once designated as required off-street parking shall never
be converted, changed or occupied by another structure or use of land until
equal facilities are provided elsewhere.
      (2)   Land area designated for off-street parking shall be used solely
for the parking of vehicles and no commercial repair work, storage or service
of any kind shall be conducted on any part of such parking lot.
      (3)   Any use not specifically mentioned shall provide off-street parking
facilities in accordance with the requirements established for a use which is
similar in nature.
      (4)   For a change of occupancy where the parking demand is increased and
where no new construction requiring a building permit is anticipated, but a
zoning certificate is required, the Zoning Administrator shall review the
parking requirements of the proposed use.  Two copies of a parking plan shall
be submitted to the Zoning Administrator showing the entire property, the means
of ingress and egress, location of buildings, parking spaces, landscaping and
any other proposed facilities.  If the plan conforms to the intent and
provisions of this section, the Zoning Administrator shall approve both copies,
keeping one on file and returning the other to the property owner.
      (5)   The Planning Commission may grant a variance to the requirements of
this section where joint use is made of parking facilities, providing the
operating hours of such uses do not overlap.
      (6)   Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same
lot as the structure or use served, except that a parking facility providing
the sum of parking spaces required of several uses may be provided contiguous
and in common to the several structures and uses served.  (Ord. 06-019. Passed

area of the building or be used for dwelling purposes.
   (b)   Essential Services.  Essential services shall be permitted as

established or observed on one side of a street within one block or for a
distance of 600 feet on both sides of a lot in question, by at least fifty
percent (50%) of all property, according to front footage, and such established
setback is more than that required by the Ordinance for that district, then no
building construction or alteration shall extend beyond the established setback
line.  When the established setback line is less than required by the
Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator may permit the construction or alteration
to extend to the established setback line.
   (i)   Construction.  Nothing in this Ordinance shall be deemed to require
any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building upon
which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this
Ordinance, and upon which actual construction has been diligently carried on
and provided further that such building shall be completed within one year from
the date of passage of this Ordinance.
   (j)   Railroad Rights of Way.  For the purposes of this Ordinance, railroad
rights of way shall be permitted as authorized and regulated by State and
Federal laws, it being the intent of this section to exempt railroad rights of
way from the application of this Ordinance.  Buildings and structures intended
to be constructed within railroad rights of way shall comply with the use, area
and height regulations of the district in which they are located.  Spur tracks
shall be extended from the existing railroad right of way to adjacent
industrial districts only when they are totally within an industrial district.
   (k)   Exception to Yard Requirements.  The yard requirements set forth in
this Ordinance shall not apply to dwellings located above or as a part of
commercial buildings. 
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   (l)   Exception for One- and Two-Family Dwellings.  Nothing in this
Ordinance shall prohibit an existing one- or two-family dwelling from being
altered, enlarged or reconstructed, regardless of the zoning district in which
it is located, provided that a nonconforming structure does not have an
increase in nonconformity.  In addition, the Planning Commission shall have the
power to permit the construction of a one- or two-family dwelling in any
district, provided the character of the area is conducive to residential
development and it will not adversely affect any surrounding business or
industrial property. 
(Ord. 06-019.  Passed 1-17-06.)
   (m)   Home Occupation in Residential Units.  Regardless of the zoning
district in which a dwelling unit is located, the occupant of that unit shall
be permitted to have a home occupation as a conditionally permitted use in
accordance with Section
1183.03.
      (Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)

   1183.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for a more detailed consideration
of certain specified uses or activities with regard to their location, design,
size, operation, intensity of use, generation of traffic, ingress and egress,
compatibility with permitted uses and other factors.  Uses possessing these
unique characteristics are designated as conditionally permitted uses and are
permitted through the issuance of a conditional zoning certificate with such
conditions and safeguards attached as may be deemed necessary for the
protection of the public safety and welfare.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1183.02  PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Application to Zoning Administrator.  An application for a conditional
zoning certificate shall be made to the Zoning Administrator on a special form
provided for this purpose.  An application fee as provided in Section
1155.04 shall be submitted with the application.
   (b)   Data Required With Application.  A site plan, plot plan or development
plan of the entire property drawn at a scale of 1":20', and showing the
location of all abutting streets, the location of all existing and proposed
parking, landscaping, lot dimensions and points of ingress and egress.
   (c)   Site Plan Review.  Whenever required by this Zoning Ordinance, the
site plan shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission before a conditional
zoning certificate is issued by the Zoning Administrator.  Unless required by
this Ordinance, the Zoning Administrator may review the site plan without
submittal to the Commission and upon determination that all requirements have
been met, shall issue the conditional zoning certificate.  The Zoning
Administrator, at his option, may submit the site plan to the Commission for
its review and upon order of the Commission, shall then issue the certificate.
   (d)   Revocation of Conditional Zoning Certificates.  The breach of any
safeguard, condition or requirement of the Ordinance, Planning Commission or
Zoning Administrator, shall constitute a violation of the Ordinance, and the
Zoning Administrator may revoke such certificate.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1183.03  CONDITIONAL ZONING REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)    Home Occupations.
      (1)   Intent.  It is the intent of this section to permit certain home
occupations as accessory uses in dwelling units, so long as they are clearly
incidental and secondary to the use of the dwelling for residential purposes
and do not change the character thereof or adversely affect the uses in the
residential neighborhood of which they are a part.  In general, a home
occupation is an accessory use located and conducted so that the average
neighbor, under normal circumstances, would not be aware of its existence.
      (2)   Permit exemption.  Home occupations may be established without the
resident obtaining a conditional zoning certificate.
      (3)   Permitted home occupation.

of the type and scale of use which can normally be conducted within the limits
of the restrictions established in this section; however, there may be similar
uses not specifically listed which meet the intent and regulations of this
section, in which case they may be permitted at the discretion of the Zoning
Administrator.  Uses on this list which do not comply with all regulations of
this section shall not be permitted.

representative, manufacturer's representative, accountant, architect, broker,
consultant, contractor, engineer, insurance agent, lawyer, realtor or similar
professional, provided that such home occupations do not involve the presence
of more than one client vehicle at a time.   
            8.   The repair of small electrical appliances, typewriters,
cameras or other similar small mechanical items.
         B.   The following list is illustrative of uses or scales of operation
which are generally beyond the limits permitted for home occupations and
therefore would normally be prohibited as home occupations.

   1185.01  PURPOSE.
   It shall be the policy of the City to promote progressive development of
land and construction thereon by encouraging planned unit development to
achieve:
   (a)   A maximum choice of living environments by allowing a variety of
housing and building types and permitting an increased density per acre and a
reduction in lot dimensions, yards, building setbacks and area requirements;
   (b)   A more useful pattern of open space and recreation areas and, if
permitted as part of the project, more convenience in the location of accessory
commercial uses and services;
   (c)   A development pattern which preserves and utilizes natural topography
and geologic features, scenic vistas, trees and other vegetation, and prevents
the disruption of natural drainage patterns;
   (d)   A more efficient use of land than is generally achieved through
conventional development resulting in substantial savings through shorter
utilities and streets;
   (e)   A development pattern in harmony with land use density, transportation
facilities and community facilities objectives of the comprehensive plan.
   The City is also prepared to accept a greater population density in
undeveloped areas than that reflected by present zoning provided the developer
can demonstrate than any increment of public cost clearly attributable to
increased densities shall be compensated for by the private amenities and
public benefits to be achieved by the plan of development.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1185.02  PROVISIONS GOVERNING PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS.
   Because of the special characteristics of planned unit developments, special
provisions governing the development of land for this purpose are required. 
Whenever there is a conflict or difference between the provisions of this
chapter and those of the other chapters of this Zoning Ordinance, the
provisions of this chapter shall be governed by the respective provisions found
elsewhere in the Ordinance.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1185.03  PLANNED UNIT DISTRICT; APPLICATION.
   Planned Districts may be established by application in accordance with the
provisions set forth below.
   Any application for a Planned Development, for any land use or structure
permitted under this Zoning Ordinance shall be submitted in accordance with the
following procedure.
   (a)   Pre-Application Conference.
      (1)   Prior to preparing a Development Plan, the landowner shall consult
informally with the City Planning Commission, City Engineer, Zoning
Administrator and Richland County Regional Planning Commission staff in order
that he may become familiar with subdivision and zoning requirements, the
relation of his property to existing conditions, future plans, community
facilities, utilities and services.
      (2)   The landowner shall also consult informally with public utility
companies in order to determine the character and extent of electric power and
telephone lines and also to determine the most advantageous routing of these
lines and utility easements.
   (b)   Planned Unit Development Principles.  Prior to concluding the pre-
application conference between the landowner and the City Planning Commission,
the Commission shall consider the following principles governing Planned
Developments in the City:
      (1)   It shall be the duty of the City Planning Commission to discourage
Planned Developments that are far in advance of the needs of the City, or
which, by their very nature or location, cannot be efficiently served by public
utilities, fire or police protection or other Municipal services, or which are
being unwisely or prematurely developed.
      (2)   It shall further be the duty of the City Planning Commission to
encourage that Planned Developments be coordinated with the development of
adjacent small parcels of land and to this end, the City Planning Commission
shall require the landowner to submit sketch plans for such coordinated
development, showing how streets can be connected, lot orientations coordinated
and open spaces extended.  The City Planning Commission may also arrange
meetings with the several owners of such small parcels of land or may carry out
the intent of this directive by such other means as may be lawful and
appropriate.
   (c)   Application to Planning Commission.  An application for a Planned
Development shall be submitted to the Planning Commission on a special form
provided for that purpose.  The application shall be executed by or on behalf
of the landowner and filed in duplicate with the Planning Commission.  A filing
fee in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00), payable to the City, shall
be submitted to the Planning Commission.  Such filing fee shall be used to
defray the cost of the public hearing and work done by the planning staff of
the City, the Richland County Regional Planning Commission, City Engineer and
City Zoning Administrator.
   (d)   Data Required With Application for Approval of Development Plan.  The
application for approval of a Planned Development shall include three copies of
a Development Plan, drawn at a scale of 1" = 50' and including the following
information:
      (1)   Location and the size of the area involved and the nature of the
landowner's interest in the land proposed to be developed.
      (2)   The density of land use to be allocated to parts of the area to be
developed.
      (3)   The locations, functions, ownership and manner of maintenance of
common open space areas.
      (4)   The use, approximate height, bulk and location of buildings and
other structures.
      (5)   The feasibility of proposals for the disposal of sanitary waste and
stormwater.
      (6)   The substance of covenants, grants of easements or other
restrictions to be imposed upon the use of land, buildings and structures,
including proposed easements for public utilities.
      (7)   The provisions for parking of vehicles and the location and width
of proposed streets and existing streets abutting the property.
      (8)   A statement indicating the required modifications in the
regulations of the Ordinance, otherwise applicable to the subject property.
      (9)   In the case of plans which call for staging development over a
period of years, a schedule, showing the time within which applications for
final approval of all parts of the Planned Development are to be filed.
      (10)   Such applications shall also be accompanied by a written statement
by the landowner setting forth the reasons why, in his opinion, the Planned
Development would be in the public interest and would be consistent with the
specific criteria, if any, theretofore, published and adopted by the Planning
Commission.
   (e)   Review by the Richland County Regional Planning Commission Staff and
the City Planning Commission.  One copy of every application for a Planned
District, received by the Secretary of the Planning Commission, shall be
promptly delivered to the staff of the Richland County Regional Planning
Commission for their review and report to the City Planning Commission.  The
Richland County Regional Planning Commission shall, as a part of its review,
consult with the City Engineer and other departments of the City concerning the
application.  The City Planning Commission shall review and take action on the
application within sixty days following the date the application was received
by the Commission.  The City Planning Commission shall base its approval of a
Planned District on the following considerations:
      (1)   That the Plan is consistent in all respects with the purposes,
intent and applicable standards of this Ordinance.
      (2)   That the proposed development as envisioned in the Plan is in
conformance with the Comprehensive Plan adopted for the City.
      (3)   That the proposed Plan provides for the preservation and protection
of existing trees, ground cover, topsoil, streams, rock outcroppings and scenic
views from dangers and damages caused by excessive and poorly planned grading
for streets and building sites.
      (4)   That the benefits, improved arrangement and the design of the
Planned Development justify the deviation from the standard zoning district
requirements incorporated in this Ordinance.
   (f)   Criteria for Recommendations by Planning Commission.  Before making
its recommendation, the Planning Commission shall find that the facts submitted
with the application and presented at the public hearing establish that:
      (1)   The proposed development can be initiated within two years of the
date of approval;
      (2)   Each individual unit of the development, as well as the total
development, can exist as an independent unit capable of creating an

   1185.06  DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES AND STANDARDS; MINIMUM PROJECT AREA.
   The gross area of a tract of land to be developed in a Planned Unit
Development District shall be a minimum of twenty acres, provided, however,
that smaller parcels may be considered on the basis of their potential to
satisfy the objectives of this chapter as stated in Section
1185.01.
   (a)   Planned Unit Development District-Residential.
      (1)   Maximum Density of Residential Development.  The dwelling unit
density of any area is to remain unchanged and conform to the basic overall
density requirements of the standard zoning district:
         However, the dwelling unit density may be increased if the character
of the development and/or amenities incorporated in the development warrant an
increase in density.  In no case, however, shall the dwelling unit density
exceed the density which would be achieved under the standard zoning district
designation by more than twenty percent (20%), where the City Planning
Commission determines that it would be appropriate to apply a higher density to
the uses proposed in the Development Plan.  The percentage increase in density
shall be governed by the factors listed below which are to be treated as parts
and not totals:
         A.   Open space reservations shall be considered cause for dwelling
unit density increases, in accordance with the following:
            1.   Maximum dwelling unit density increase of ten percent (10%)
for the first acre of open space per twenty total acres of development;
            2.   Maximum dwelling unit density increase of six percent (6%) for
the second acre of open space for twenty total acres of development;
            3.   Maximum dwelling unit density increase of three percent (3%)
for each additional acre of open space per twenty total acres of development.
         B.   Character, identity, architectural and siting variations
incorporated in a development shall be considered cause for dwelling unit
density increases not to exceed the density which would be achieved under the
standard zoning district designation by more than twenty percent (20%),
provided such design variations make a substantial contribution to the
objectives of the Planned District.  The degree of distinctiveness and
desirable variation achieved shall govern the percentage of increase in
dwelling unit density which Council may approve.  Incorporated design elements
may include, but are not limited to, the following:
            1.   Landscaping:
               a.   Streetscape.
               b.   Open space and plazas.
               c.   Pedestrian-way treatment.
               d.   Recreational areas.
            2.   Siting:
               a.   Visual focal points.
               b.   Use or treatment of existing land features.
               c.   Circulation pattern.
               d.   Variations in building setbacks.
               e.   Building groups.
            3.   Design features:
               a.   Architectural styles.
               b.   Harmonious use of building and screening materials.
               c.   Parking arrangements broken by screening devices of
landscape features.
               d.   Varied use of dwelling types and arrangements:
                  i.   Atrium or court.
                  ii.   Townhouse.
                  iii.   Terrace.
                  iv.   Tower.
               e.   Unique group developments:
                  i.   Housing for the elderly.
                  ii.   Singles' apartments.
                  iii.   Retirement community.
      (2)   Variations in Lot Area and Dimensions.  The maximum number of
dwellings permitted in a Planned District shall conform to the overall density
approved for the Plan.  However, lot area and dimensions do not have to meet
the specific Ordinance requirements.  Residential lot size and lot width
reductions shall be permitted in accordance with the following schedule:
         A.   Up to thirty percent (30%) reduction in lot size and a thirty
percent (30%) reduction in lot width shall be permitted, providing up to thirty
percent (30%) of the total site area (excluding street right of way) is devoted
to open space or recreational facilities.
         B.   Drawings and plans as submitted shall show that the relationships
between interior and exterior living areas on the site are desirable and
adequate, and that the living environment is as desirable as compliance with
the strict requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.
         (Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   (b)   Planned Unit Development District-Professional.
      (1)   Units in a planned unit development-professional shall be subject
to the area, height and bulk regulations provided for in Section
1167.04.
         (Ord. 91-156.  Passed 5-21-91.)
   1185.07  LOTS TO ABUT UPON COMMON OPEN SPACE.
   Every property developed under the Planned Unit Development approach should
be designed to abut upon common open space or similar areas whenever possible. 
A clustering of dwellings in encouraged.  In areas where townhouses are used,
there shall be no more than eight townhouse units in any contiguous group.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1185.08  PERIMETER YARDS.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of this chapter, every lot within the Planned
Development abutting the perimeter of the Planned Development District shall
maintain all yard requirements specified for the conventional zoning district.
   Where perimeter lots abut a street right of way along the rear or side lot
line, trees or other plantings, earth mounds or other obscuring devices of
sufficient height and density to afford visual privacy shall be provided along
the rear or side lot line.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1185.09  DISPOSITION OF OPEN SPACE.
   The required amount of common open space land reserved under a Planned Unit
Development shall be held in common ownership by owners who buy property within
the development and retained as common open space for parks, recreation and
related uses.
   The responsibility for the maintenance of all open spaces shall be specified
by the developer before approval of the final Development Plan.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1185.10  ARRANGEMENT OF COMMERCIAL USES.
   When Planned Development Districts include commercial uses, commercial
buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups having common parking
areas and common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the number of
potential accident locations at intersections with thoroughfares.  Planting
screens or fences shall be provided on the perimeter of the commercial areas
abutting residential areas.
   All areas designed for future expansion or not intended for immediate
improvement or development shall be landscaped or otherwise maintained in a
neat and orderly manner as specified by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 86-260.  Passed 12-16-86.)
   1185.11  COVENANTS AND RESTRICTIONS.
   The Planned Development shall provide common open space as required by this
Zoning Ordinance and for the establishment of an organization (herein called
the Association) for the ownership and maintenance of the common open space. 
All common open spaces located in the Development shall be reserved for the
private use and benefit of the owners of the lots located in the Development.
   The Planned Development shall provide for such plats, agreements, protective
covenants, easements and documents to be recorded providing for the ownership,
maintenance and financing of such maintenance for the common open space, as
will reasonably ensure its continuity, conservation, maintenance and
preservation and will work to prevent its diversion and deterioration.
   In the event that the Association established to own and develop and
maintain the common open space, or any successor organization, shall, at any
time after the establishment of the Planned Development, fail to maintain the
common open space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the
Plan, or permit it to deteriorate so as to constitute a public nuisance, the
City may serve written notice upon such organization, or upon the residents of
the Planned Development, setting forth the manner in which the Association has
failed to maintain the common open space in reasonable condition, or has
permitted a public nuisance to develop.  Such notice shall include a demand
that such deficiencies be cured within thirty days thereof and shall state the
date and place of a hearing thereon before the Planning Commission to be held
within fifteen days after the notice.  At such hearing, the Planning Commission
may modify the terms of the original notice as to the deficiencies and may give
an extension of time within which they shall be cured.  If the deficiencies set
forth in the original notice, or in the modifications thereof, are not cured
within such thirty days or any extension thereof, the City, in order to prevent
further deterioration or to abate the public nuisance, may enter upon the
common open space and maintain the same until the Association established for
such purpose resumes its responsibility.  Such entry, maintenance and abatement
upon the common open space shall not vest in the City any rights to use the
common open space for any other purpose.
   To provide for the costs of such maintenance and abatement by the City, the
developer or the Association established to own the common open space, shall
simultaneously with the execution of the unit plat, grant to the City a
conservation easement vesting in the City all of the rights necessary to carry
out the terms of this section, as well as all rights of the developer or
Association, to collect dues or assessments from the property owners within the
development, which dues and assessments, or a reasonable substitution thereof
for the maintenance of the common open space, shall be an obligation of the
property owners under recorded protective covenants, as well as the articles of
incorporation or bylaws of the Association, formed to hold title to the common
open space.

   Notwithstanding Section
1153.03 (37) excepting "essential services" from the provisions of this
chapter, this communication tower regulation is intended to preserve the
opportunity for improved services and technological advances from such consumer
oriented public services and at the same time preserve the quality of life in
residential areas close to tower installations including to protect the health
and safety of residents from possible adverse impacts of emissions including
noise; to protect the visual quality and natural beauty of the community, and
to provide guidelines for zoning compliance to protect the general welfare,
health and safety of the City's residents.  (Ord. 95-236.  Passed 12-20-95.)
   1187.02  DEFINITIONS.

Commission. In making its decision, while upholding the purpose of this
section, the Commission shall consider that the proposed tower and attendant
installation be subject to the following:
      (1)    Sited so that all reasonable alternatives for tower placement have
been clearly and convincingly demonstrated so that the installation will
minimize the visual intrusion of the tower.
      (2)    Shared with other users to minimize the proliferation of towers
within the City, including the presentation of evidence demonstrating that
consideration was given to co-locating the communication devices and related
equipment on nearby pre-existing towers and that such co-location was rejected
due to one of the following reasons:
         A.    Adequate space was not available on any nearby tower.
         B.    No nearby tower could be structurally reinforced to accept such
co-location at a reasonable cost.
         C.    Interference with existing signal devices was unacceptable and
could not be shielded at a reasonable cost.
         D.    Good faith negotiations with the owner(s) of existing towers
could not produce a satisfactory agreement.
         E.    Any other justifiable reason acceptable to the City Planning
Commission.

and setbacks.
      (4)    Located to minimize the visual impact at base elevation of the
proposed structure by a comprehensive landscape plan.
   (c)    Plans submitted for proposed towers shall show conformance with the
following development standards:
      (1)    Minimum setback from all property lines to the tower and all
accessory buildings shall be a distance equal to the height of the tower;
provided, however, in zones designated “industrial” by these Codified
Ordinances, setbacks may be determined from the property lines of contiguous
owners to the applicant’s property with the written approval of such contiguous
property owners.  Setback shall be defined as the distance from the property
line to the nearest portion of the structure(s).
      (2)    Underground wiring to the site shall be required.
      (3)    Equipment, mobile or immobile, not used in direct support of the

CHAPTER 1189
Planning Overlay
1189.01   Purpose and intent.
1189.02   Council-approved plan.
1189.03   Application.
1189.04   Overlay area.
1189.05   Permitted uses.
1189.06   Standards.
1189.07   Map designation.
   1189.01  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   (a)   This chapter establishes a planning overlay which provides the means
to incorporate in the Zoning Code development standards designed to implement
Council-approved plans for special areas.  Overlay standards and standards
extracted from such approved plans, may increase, decrease or add conditions to
the minimum development standards of the underlying district, but shall not
include additions or deletions to permitted uses within such district.
   (b)   The planning overlay provides a formalized method for implementing
acceptable community plans through specialized standards intended to achieve
physical development objectives in certain areas of the City.  Such objectives
transcend single parcel ownership and land use district boundaries and
represent a need to establish, maintain, or change the character of development
in a planning area.
(Ord. 04-106.  Passed 6-15-04.)
   1189.02  COUNCIL-APPROVED PLAN.
   Any person or organization proposing special development standards for an
area shall first complete a planning process which culminates in a Council-
approved plan by ordinance.  At a minimum, such process shall include the
preparation of a plan coordination with the City Zoning Administrator.  The
planning document should clearly describe the planning area and explain why the
area is special or unique.  Recommendations which may affect development
standards for the area should be documented.
(Ord. 04-106.  Passed 6-15-04.)
   1189.03  APPLICATION.
   (a)   Any person or organization desiring the establishment of a planning
overlay shall file an application in conformity with all the provisions for
amendments to the Zoning Code and the provisions of this chapter with the
Office of the Zoning Administrator on a form provided by it.  Said application
will be processed and reviewed by the staff, Planning Commission and City
Council as a re-zoning application.  A fee may be imposed by ordinance of
Council.
   (b)   The intended purpose of a planning overlay shall be clearly evident
and relate to the underlying land use pattern in a reasonable way.  Proposals
should exhibit the following characteristics:
      (1)   Implement recommendations contained in a Council-approved plan
passed by ordinance.
      (2)   Specify standards which establish, maintain or change the
development character of an area.
      (3)   Evidence advanced planning which supports and justifies the
variations in existing standards or the imposition of additional standards.
   (c)   The Zoning Administrator may request additional information when
needed to properly review the application.  In all cases the minimum standards
of the underlying zoning classification shall govern unless the planning
overlay approved by Council specifically stipulates a variation to that
standard.  The planning overlay shall only be used to vary the physical
development standards of a district and shall in no way be used or construed so
as to be used to change the permitted uses of the underlying zoning
classification.
(Ord. 04-106.  Passed 6-15-04.)
   1189.04  OVERLAY AREA.
   The area to which an overlay applies is any reasonable portion or all of
that territory included in the Council-approved plan.
(Ord. 04-106. Passed 6-15-04.)
   1189.05  PERMITTED USES.
   Within an area identified by a planning overlay a building or premises may
be used for one or more of the uses permitted by the underlying zoning
classification.
(Ord. 04-106.  Passed 6-15-04.)
   1189.06  STANDARDS.
   Any use of property subject to a planning overlay shall meet or exceed each
overlay standard.  When overlay standards are not specified, those development
standards required by the underlying district apply.
(Ord. 04-106.  Passed 6-15-04.)
   1189.07  MAP DESIGNATION.
   Upon institution of a planning overlay by ordinance of Council, the Zoning
Map shall be amended to indicate the area subject to a planning overlay by the
addition of an appropriate border designation, initial and a hyphen (P-
) immediately preceding the symbolic designation of the underlying zoning.

   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
   The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.
      (OBC 101.3)
   1311.03 SCOPE.
   The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall apply to the construction,
alteration, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, equipment, use and
occupancy, location, maintenance, removal and demolition of every building or
structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures.  As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and
any rules adopted by the Board.
   An owner may exceed the requirements of the Ohio Building Code in compliance
with Section 102.7 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (a)   Detached one-, and two-, and three-family dwellings and structures
incidental to those dwellings which are not constructed as industrialized units
shall comply with local residential codes, if any, adopted by the authority
having jurisdiction.  This exception does not include the energy provisions
required in “Chapter 13, Energy Efficiency” of the OBC (see Sections 3781.06,
3781.181 and 3781.182 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (b)   Buildings owned by and used for a function of the United States
Government;
   (c)   Buildings or structures which are incident to the use for agricultural
purposes of the land on which said buildings or structures are located,
provided such buildings or structures are not used in the business of retail
trade; for the purposes of this section, a building or structure is not
considered used in the business of retail trade if fifty percent or more of the
gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller.  (See Sections 3781.06 and
3781.061 of the Ohio Revised Code);
   (d)   Agricultural labor camps;
   (e)   Type A or Type B family day-care homes;
   (f)   Buildings or structures which are designed, constructed and maintained
in accordance with federal standards and regulations and are used primarily for
federal and state military purposes where the U.S. Secretary of Defense,
pursuant to 10 U.S.C. Sections 18233(a)(1) and 18237, has acquired by purchase,
lease, or transfer, and constructs, expands, rehabilitates, or corrects and
equips, such buildings or structures as he determines to be necessary to carry
out the purposes of Chapter 1803 of the U.S.C.;
   (g)   Manufactured homes constructed under “24 CFR Part 3280", “Manufactured
Home Construction and Safety Standards”.
      (OBC 101.2)
   1311.04  COMPLIANCE.
   (a)   No owner or any other person shall construct, erect, build or equip
any building or structure to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable, or
make any addition thereto or alteration thereof, except in case of repairs for
maintenance without affecting the construction, sanitation, safety or other
vital feature of such building or structure, without complying with this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapters 3781 and 3791 or the Ohio Building Code, or fail to
comply with any lawful order issued pursuant thereto.

(ORC 3791.01, 3791.03)
   (c)   No owner shall proceed with the construction, erection, alteration or
equipment of any building to which the Ohio Building Code is applicable until
the plans or drawings, specifications, and data have been approved as Ohio R.C.
3791.04 requires, or the industrialized unit inspected at the point of origin. 
No plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given
unless the building represented would, if constructed, repaired, erected, or
equipped comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rule made under those chapters.  (ORC 3791.04)
   1311.05  EXISTING STRUCTURES.
   The provisions of Chapter 34 of the Ohio Building Code shall control the
alteration, repair, addition, and change of occupancy of any existing
structure.
   The occupancy of any structure currently existing on the date of adoption of
this Code shall be permitted to continue without change provided the alleged
occupancy can be shown to have existed for more than two years and there are no
orders of the Building Official pending, no evidence of fraud, or no serious
safety or sanitation hazard.
   Buildings constructed in accordance with plans which have been approved
prior to the effective date of this Code are existing buildings.
(OBC 102.6)
   1311.06  VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   Adjudication Orders Required Before Legal Proceedings.  Before the
Municipality attempts to enforce Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or any rules adopted pursuant thereto, by any remedy, civil or criminal,
it shall issue an adjudication order within the meaning of Sections 119.06 to
119.13 of the Ohio Revised Code or a stop work order as provided in Section
1311.07.  Every adjudication order shall:
      (1)   Cite the law or rules directly involved and shall specify what
appliances, site preparations, additions, or alterations to structures, plans,
materials, assemblages or procedures are necessary for the same to comply with
Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code.
      (2)   Include notice to the party of the procedure for appeal and right
to a hearing if requested within thirty days of the mailing of the notice.  The
notice shall also inform the party that at the hearing he may be represented by
counsel, present his arguments or contentions orally or in writing and present
evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure.  When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner’s agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board.  The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board.  Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation.  Upon the issuance of any order provided for
in this section or Section
1311.07, the person receiving an order shall cease work upon the site
preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or shall cease using the
appliance, materials, assemblages or manufactured product identified in the
order until such time as the appeal provided for in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
   1311.07  STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority.  Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto.  The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance.  The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner’s agent and the person
doing the work.  Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall
immediately cease. The stop work order shall state the reason for the order,
and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance.  Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition.  Failure to
cease work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public
nuisance.
(OBC 114)
   1311.08  CONFLICT.
   (a)   General.  Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law.  The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.  However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio.  The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders
issued by the Fire Marshal pursuant to Chapter 3743, of the Ohio Revised Code
prevail in the event of a conflict.

protective measures when necessary for the safeguarding of other traffic. Due
regard shall be taken of traffic in both directions, and every possible effort
shall be made to prevent traffic congestion. Red flags, one or more flagmen or
a pilot car may be required.
   (j)    Noncompliance with the general or special provisions of a permit,
exceeding the weights or dimensions granted, or operating on dates or upon
streets other than assigned, shall render the permit null and void and the
operator of the vehicle subject to arrest.
   (k)    Within thirty days after issuance of the permit, the structure or
building must be moved or the permit will be void, unless an extension of time
is granted by the Director of Public Works because of an act of God or events
fully beyond the control of the permittee.
   1355.05  BASEMENT; SEWERS AND UTILITIES.
   Within seventy-two hours after any part of the structure or building has
been removed from its foundation, the basement area shall be filled and the
surface graded and cleared of all building material and debris.
   Also, within such seventy-two hour period, all utilities and sewers are to
be shut off and/or plugged. Such utilities and sewers shall be plugged either
at the inspection test tee, curb line or the building foundation line at the
discretion of the Director of Public Works.
   1355.06  BOND FOR EXPENSE TO CITY.
   Before a permit to move a structure or building is issued, a cash bond of
two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500) shall be deposited with the City to
cover any minor damage to City or private property or additional fees incurred
during the move. If such damage or fees exceed two thousand five hundred
dollars ($2,500), the permittee shall be fully liable for same. Such cash bond
is to be deposited with the Director of Finance. Any unused portion of such
cash bond shall be released when the permittee has complied with all of the
provisions of this chapter.
   1355.99  PENALTY.

   1359.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety, and general welfare of its
citizens.
   (b)    Findings of Fact.  The City of Mansfield ("City") has special flood
hazard areas that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss
of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and
governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection
and relief, and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are
inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations
are adopted.
   (c)    Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)    Protect human life and health;
      (2)    Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)    Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)    Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)    Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)    Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)    Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)    Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)    Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall
apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City
of Mansfield as identified in Section
1359.01(f), including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by
City of Mansfield.
   (f)    Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes ofthese regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:

      (2)    Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
include: none.
      (3)    Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Mansfield as required by Section
 1359.04(c), Subdivisions and Large Developments.
Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted by
reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the City of Mansfield Engineering Department, 30 N.
Diamond Street, 6th Floor, Mansfield Ohio 44902.
   (g)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances including subdivision regulations,
zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these regulations
and any other ordinance, the more restrictive shall be followed. These
regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or easement but the
land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
   (h)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.
   Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with a state or
Federal law,
such state or Federal law shall take precedence over these regulations.
   (i)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the City of Mansfield, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)    Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations
be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision
shall not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part
thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. 11-031.  Passed 3-1-11.)
   1359.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (1)   Accessory Structure.  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (2)   Appeal.  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's

   (8)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (9)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (10)   Fill.  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (11)   Flood or Flooding.  A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (12)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM).  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (13)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (14)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones.  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      A.   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
      B.   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
      C.   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
      D.   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
      E.   Zone A99:

the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
      F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
         Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
   (15)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS).  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (16)   Flood Protection Elevation (FPE).  The Flood Protection Elevation, or
FPE, is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (17)   Floodway.  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually characterized by
any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters, high potential
for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion forces.
   (18)   Freeboard.  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (19)   Historic structure.  Any structure that is:
      A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      D.   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by City's historic preservation program, which program is certified by the Ohio
Historic Preservation Office.
   (20)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (21)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC).  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
A revision based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly
included in a designated special flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current
effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and establishes that a specific property is
not located in a special flood hazard area.
      B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows
changes to flood zones, flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations,
and planimetric features. One common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination
concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the
base flood elevation and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard
area.
      C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies
with the minimum National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management
criteria. A CLOMR does not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (22)   Lowest floor.  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure
below the lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (23)   Manufactured home.  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (24)   Manufactured home park.  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (25)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (26)   New construction.  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Mansfield Flood
Insurance Rate Map, January 3, 1986, and includes any subsequent improvements
to such structures.
   (27)   Person.  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (28)   Recreational vehicle.  A vehicle which is:
      A.   Built on a single chassis,
      B.   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      C.   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      D.   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (29)   Registered Professional Architect.  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (30)   Registered Professional Engineer.  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (31)   Registered Professional Surveyor.  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (32)   Special Flood Hazard Area.  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, previous flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (33)   Start of construction.  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (34)   Structure.  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (35)   Substantial Damage.  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (36)   Substantial Improvement.  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      A.   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      C.   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (37)   Variance.  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (38)   Violation.  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.
      (Ord. 11-031.  Passed 3-1-11.)
   1359.03  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)    Designation of the Floodplain Administrator.  The Manager of the
Bureau of Buildings, Inspections, Licenses and Permits is hereby appointed to

minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that City of Mansfield flood maps, studies and other data identified in
Section
1359.01(f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)    Requirement to submit new technical data.
         A.    For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.    Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.    Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed
structures where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special
flood hazard area;
            3.    Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.    Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring
the establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1359.04(c).
         B.    It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical
data, required in accordance with Section
1359.03(j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA. Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.    The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.    Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.    Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.    Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1359.03(j)(l)A.
      (2)    Right to submit new technical data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of the City
of Mansfield, and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)    Annexation/Detachment. Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the City
of Mansfield have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
City's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the City of Mansfield
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the City of
Mansfield suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits
or the new area for which the City of Mansfield has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)    Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines
shall apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas
of special flood hazard:
      (1)    In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)    Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)    When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.    Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the
FEMA, the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all
previously existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of
administering these regulations.
         B.    Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by
FEMA, the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no
base flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1359.05, Appeals and Variances.
      (5)    Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)    Substantial Damage Determinations.  Damages to structures may result
from a variety of causes including flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.
After such a damage event, the Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other measures to
assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent repair process.
These measures include issuing press releases, public service announcements,
and other public information materials related to the floodplain development
permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other federal,
state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage determinations;
providing owners of damaged structures materials and other information related
to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood hazard areas; and
assist owners of substantially damaged structures with Increased Cost of
Compliance insurance claims.

resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads.
   (i)    Assurance of Flood Carrying Capacity.  Pursuant to the purpose and
methods of reducing flood damage stated in these regulations, the following
additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)    Development in floodways.
         A.    In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.    Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base
flood elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by
the applicant:
            1.    Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1359.03(j)(1);
            2.    An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.    Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.    Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.    Concurrence of the Mayor of City of Mansfield and the Chief
Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)    Development in riverine areas with base flood elevations but no
floodways.
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.    Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.    An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.    Section
1359.04(i)(1)B, items 1 and 3-5.
      (3)    Alterations of a watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of"bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.    The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.    Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.    The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
City of Mansfield specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.    The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1359.03(j)(1)A.3 when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
            (Ord. 11-031.  Passed 3-1-11.)
   1359.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)    Appeals Board Established.
      (1)    The City Planning Commission established in Chapter 1159, in
addition to its other duties, is hereby designated as the Appeals Board to hear
and decide appeals and requests for variances from the requirements of this
chapter.
      (2)    The Appeals Board shall be organized and conduct its proceedings
in accordance with Sections
1159.01 and
1159.02. All meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except
that the Board may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasijudicial
hearings in accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its
proceedings showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep
records of all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and
filed in the Bureau of Buildings, Inspections, Licenses and Permits.
   (b)    Powers and Duties.
      (1)    The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is
alleged there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of
these regulations.
      (2)    Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1359.05(d) of these regulations.
   (c)    Appeals.  Any person affected by any notice and order, or other
official action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be
granted a hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such
person shall file, within ten (10) days of the date of such notice and order,
or other official action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or
for the mitigation of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain
Administrator's decision. Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the
applicant, and be filed with the Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the
appeal, the Floodplain Administrator shall transmit said notice and all
pertinent information on which the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made
to the Appeals Board.
   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)    Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)    Application for a variance.
         A.    Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.    All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee in the amount of fifty dollars ($50.00).
      (2)    Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)    Public hearing. 
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.    The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to
the injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.    The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these regulations,
the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances, as
it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)    Other conditions for variances.
         A.    Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.    Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1359.05(d)(3)A.1. to 11. have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
         C.    Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest

   1361.01  AUTHORITY AND TITLE.
   This Chapter has been developed under authority of Article XVIII, Section 3
of the Ohio Constitution.
   The official title of these rules shall be known as the “City of Manfield,
Ohio Stormwater Management Rules and Regulations.”  However, simply “Stormwater
Rules and Regulations” may be used as a short title.  (Ord. 15-066.  Passed 4-
7-15.)
   1361.02  PURPOSE.
   Council has adopted this chapter for the purpose of establishing feasible
and economically reasonable standards to achieve a level of management and
conservation practices which will abate erosion of the soil and abate the
degradation of the waters of the State by soil sediment in conjunction with
nonfarm, earth-disturbing activities.
   It is the further intent of this chapter to:
   (a)   Permit development without increasing downstreams flooding, erosion or
sedimentation.
   (b)   Reduce damage to receiving streams and impairment of their capacity
which may be caused by increases in the quantity and/or rate of water
discharged.
   (c)   Establish a basis for the design of all storm drainage systems which
will preserve the rights and options of both the dominant and servient property
owners and help assure the long-term adequacy of storm drainage systems.
      (Ord. 15-066.  Passed 4-17-15.)
   1361.03  ADOPTION OF “CITY OF MANSFIELD STORMWATER  DESIGN MANUAL”.

The provisions of this regulation are promulgated to promote the health,
safety, and welfare of the public and are not designed for the benefit of any
individual or for the benefit of any particular parcel of property.
(Ord. 15-068.  Passed 4-7-15.)
   1365.05  CONFLICTS, SEVERABILITY, NUISANCES AND RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   Where this regulation is in conflict with other provisions of law or
ordinance, the most restrictive provisions, as determined by the City of

invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, the validity
of the remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   This regulation shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a nuisance on their property, and compliance with the provisions of
this regulation shall not be a defense in any action to abate such a nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the City of Mansfield to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
site owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting there
from, and shall not result in the City of Mansfield, its officers, employees,

(Ord. 15-068.  Passed 4-7-15.)
   1365.06  RESPONSIBILITY FOR ADMINISTRATION.

   1365.07  DISCHARGE AND CONNECTION PROHIBITIONS.
   (a)   Prohibition of Illicit Discharges:  No person shall discharge, or
cause to be discharged, an illicit discharge in to the MS4.  The commencement,
conduct, or continuance of any illicit discharge to the MS4 is prohibited
except as described below:
      (1)   Water line flushing; landscape irrigation; diverted stream flows;
rising ground waters; uncontaminated ground water infiltration; uncontaminated
pumped ground water, discharges from potable water sources; foundation drains;
air conditioning condensate; irrigation water; springs; water from crawl space
pumps; footing drains; lawn watering; individual residential car washing; flows
from riparian habitats and wetlands; dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;
street wash water; and discharges or flows from firefighting activities.  These
discharges are exempt until such time as they are determined by the City of
Mansfield to be significant contributors of pollutants to the MS4.
      (2)   Discharges specified in writing by the City of Mansfield as being
necessary to protect public health and safety.
      (3)   Discharges from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment
systems existing prior to January 1, 2007 and permitted by the Richland Public
Health for the purpose of discharging treated sewage effluent in accordance
with Ohio Administrative Code 3701-29, or other applicable Richland Public
Health regulations, until such time as the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency
issues an NPDES  permitting mechanism for household sewage treatment systems
existing prior to January 1, 2007.  These discharges are exempt unless such
discharges are deemed to be creating a public health nuisance by the Richland
Public Health.  Discharges from new or replacement off-lot household sewage
treatment systems installed after January 1, 2007 are not exempt from the
requirements of this regulation.
   In compliance with the City of Mansfield Storm Water Management Program,
discharges from all off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems must

from off-lot discharging household sewage treatment systems existing prior to
January 1, 2007 will no longer be exempt from the requirements of this
regulation.

person connects a line conveying illicit discharges to the MS4, or allows such
a connection to continue.
         (Ord. 15-068.  Passed 4-7-15.)
   1365.08  MONITORING OF ILLICIT DISCHARGES AND ILLEGAL CONNECTIONS.
   (a)   Establishment of an Illicit Discharge and Illegal Connection

and eliminate illicit discharges and illegal connections to the MS4.  This
program shall include the mapping of the MS4, including MS4 outfalls and

be borne by the facility owner/operator.

facility subject to this regulation for the purposes of illicit discharge
inspection is a violation of this regulation.
      (6)   If the City of Mansfield is refused access to any part of the
facility from which storm water is discharged, and the City of Mansfield
demonstrates probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
regulation, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of an
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this
regulation or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the public health,
safety, and welfare, the City of Mansfield may seek issuance of a search
warrant, civil remedies including but not limited to injunctive relief, and/or
criminal remedies from any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (7)   Any costs associated with these inspections shall be assessed to
the facility owner/operator.  (Ord. 15-068.  Passed 4-7-15.)
   1365.09  ENFORCEMENT.

required, the Notice of Violation shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed.  Said Notice shall further advise
that, should the facility owner/operator fail to remediate or restore within
the established deadline, a legal action for enforcement may be initiated.
   (c)   Any person receiving a Notice of Violation must meet compliance
standards within the time established in the Notice of Violation.
   (d)   Administrative Hearing.  If the violation has not been corrected
pursuant to the requirements set forth in the Notice of Violation, the City of
Mansfield shall schedule an administrative hearing to determine reasons for
non-compliance and to determine the next enforcement activity.  Notice of the
administrative hearing shall be hand delivered and/or sent registered mail.
   (e)   Injunctive Relief.  It shall be unlawful for any owner/operator to
violate any provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this
regulation pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3709.211.  If an owner/operator has violated
or continues to violate the provisions of this regulation, the City of

the owner/operator from activities that would create further violations or
compelling the owner/operator to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.

   1525.01  CHIEF OF POLICE MAY INVESTIGATE FIRES.
   The Chief of Police is authorized to make investigation of the cause of any
fire in the City, and is authorized to administer oaths, issue summonses and
compel the attendance of witnesses before him with or without any books,
papers, documents or other articles that he may deem pertinent, in the
discharge of his duties under this section.
   Any witnesses who refuse to obey the order of any summons, or to testify, or

1525.99.
(1954 Code Sec. 38.30)
   1525.02  FIRE DAMAGE: REPAIR OR REMOVAL FUND.
   The City is hereby authorized to utilize the procedure described in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D), whereby no insurance company doing business in the
State shall pay a claim of a named insured for fire damage to a structure
located within the City where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
   (a)    When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the
company or companies equals or exceeds sixty percent (60%) of the aggregate
limits of liability on all fire policies covering the building or structure,
the insurance company or companies in accordance with Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Fire Chief in the aggregate two
thousand dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), and each
fraction of that amount, of a claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss
agreed to between the named insured or insureds and the insurance company or
companies the named insured or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in
the estimate.
      Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all companies
insuring the building or other structure. Policy proceeds remaining after the
transfer to the City shall be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.
      The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed estimate
of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure
after the transfer, and the designated officer shall return the amount of the
fund in excess of the estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that
the City has not commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other
structure.
   (b)    Upon receipt of the proceeds by the City as authorized by this
section, the Fire Chief shall give the proceeds to the Finance Director for
deposit in the City Treasury in a separate fund to be used solely as security
against the total cost of removing, repairing or securing incurred by the City
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
      When transferring the funds as required in subsection (a) hereof, an
insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address of the named
insured or insureds, whereupon the City shall contact the named insured or
insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City and notify
them that the following procedures will be followed: The fund shall be returned
to the named insured or insureds when repairs, or removal or securing of the
building or other structure has been completed and the required proof received
by the designated officer, if the City has not incurred any costs for such
repairs, removal or securing. If the City has incurred any costs for repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs shall be
paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the City shall transfer the
remaining funds to the named insured or insureds. Nothing in this section shall
be construed to limit the ability of a municipal corporation to recover any
deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261. Nothing in this subsection shall be
construed to prohibit the municipal corporation and the named insured or
insureds from entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to
the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the
damaged property has been negotiated.
   (c)    The Fire Chief of the City is hereby designated as the officer
authorized to carry out the duties of this section. The Fire Chief shall file a
certified copy of this section with the Superintendent of Insurance of the
State.
