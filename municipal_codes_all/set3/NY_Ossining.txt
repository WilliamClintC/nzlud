property from the assessment roll of the last preceding year, any taxes
authorized and intended to be levied thereby are not paid, or if a special
tax warrant has been returned and the taxes or any part thereof levied
thereby remain unpaid, the amount thereof may be levied upon the
same property or against the same persons upon the annual assessment
roll of the current year. The completed assessment roll shall be
presumptive evidence of the facts therein stated.

C:26
§ C4-6. Special assessment and levy. [Amended 6-20-1989 by L.L.
No. 5-1989]
If the Board of Trustees is authorized by a special election to levy a special
tax, the latest copy of the applicable part of the assessment roll of the Town
of Ossining as filed with the Board of Trustees by the Town Assessor shall
be just for the purposes of the assessment of such tax upon the taxable
property and person of the Village. Thereupon, like proceedings shall be
taken and such special tax levied in the same manner as the levy of the
annual tax.
§ C4-7. Lien of tax.
Annual or special tax is a lien prior to and superior to every other lien or
claim, except the lien of an existing tax or local assessment or real property
upon which it is levied, from the date of the delivery to the collector of
the warrant for the collection thereof, until paid or otherwise satisfied or
discharged.
§ C4-8. Lien of assessment for local improvement.
An assessment for paving, sewers, fire protection, constructing or repairing
sidewalks, sprinkling streets, trimming trees or keeping sidewalks or
streets cleared of weeds, ice, snow or other accumulations is a lien prior
and superior to every other lien or claim, except the lien of an existing
tax or local assessment, upon the real property improved or benefited
from the date of the final determination of the amount thereof, until it is
paid or otherwise satisfied or discharged. No real property is exempt from
assessment for a purpose specified in this section, except as provided in
section five of Chapter 273 of the Laws of 1886, entitled "An Act authorizing
the incorporation of associations to erect monuments to perpetuate the
memory of soldiers who fell in defense of the Union," as amended in Chapter
289 of the Laws of 1898.
§ C4-9. Warrant to treasurer.
Upon completion of the tax levy, the Clerk shall deliver to the Treasurer
one of the duplicate rolls with a warrant thereto annexed, signed by the
Mayor and attested by the Clerk, under the corporate seal of the Village,
containing a summary statement of the purposes for which the taxes are
levied, the amount thereof for each purpose and the total amount for all
purposes, and commanding the Treasurer to collect the taxes therein levied
as prescribed in § C4-10 hereof. The Treasurer shall give a receipt to the
Clerk for the warrant and assessment roll delivered to him or her.
§ C4-10. Collection of taxes by Treasurer. [Amended 12-2-1992 by
L.L. No. 12-1992]
Upon receiving the assessment roll and warrant, the Treasurer shall cause
a notice to be published at least once in the official newspapers, for that
purpose to be designated by the Board of Trustees and posted
§ C4-6 CHARTER § C4-10
C:27
conspicuously in five public places in the Village, stating that, from January
1 to January 31 inclusive and from July 1 to July 31 inclusive, except
Saturdays, Sundays and holidays, he or she will attend at a convenient place
in the Village, specified in the notice, for the purpose of receiving taxes.
At least seven days before the first date fixed in the notice, the Treasurer
shall serve a copy thereof upon each corporation named in or subject to
taxation upon the assessment roll and whose principal office is not in the
Village by delivering a copy to such person as may be designated for such
purpose, a written designation filed with the Village Clerk, or to any person
in the Village acting as the agent or representative in any capacity of such
corporation. If there is no such designated person or agent in the Village,
service of such notice shall not be required. Such taxes shall be payable
in two equal installments, the first of which shall be due and payable on
January first the first date as specified in the notice published and posted
by the Treasurer, and payable at any time from January 1 through January
31, without penalty and the second installment shall be due and payable six
months thereafter on July 1 and shall be payable at any time from July 1
through July 31, without penalty. Any person or corporation not paying such
installment or installments of such tax within the time upon which each
installment shall become due and payable, shall be charged with penalty
of 5% for the first month after the month within which such installment
became payable, and an additional 1% for each month and fraction thereof
until May first of the year following the year in which said taxes became
payable. No additional penalty shall be charged from said date until the
date upon which sale of the tax liens resulting from said taxes is had.
Both of the installments of taxes may be paid in full at any time. If the
second installment shall be paid at the time set for the payment of the first
installment, provided that all previous installments shall have been paid, a
discount thereof may, by resolution of the Board of Trustees, be allowed of
the amount of the second installment.
§ C4-11. Payment of tax anticipation notes.
If in any year the semiannual collection of taxes in the month of January
shall produce moneys not needed in financing Village matters until the next
semiannual tax collection in July, the Board of Trustees may, by unanimous
resolution of the members thereof, use part of such moneys not so needed
for the purpose of retiring tax anticipation notes of the previous year issued
against unpaid taxes for such previous year. The amount so retired shall not
exceed 60% of the amount of such notes outstanding at the time of retiring
the same. Taxes of such previous year, when collected, shall be placed in a
separate fund to be applied to the reimbursing of the current tax levy of the
amount so advanced.
§ C4-12. Return of Treasurer.
The Treasurer shall retain all taxes paid to him, except as hereinbefore
provided, and on the expiration of the time stated in the warrant or the
expiration of the time fixed by the extension thereof, or at any event within
30 days after the expiration of the time when the second installment of
§ C4-10 OSSINING CODE § C4-12
C:28
taxes shall become due and payable, shall deliver the roll and warrant to
the Village Clerk and make and file with the Village Clerk a return, in
accordance with the provisions of the warrant, showing the total amount
of the tax paid and each tax unpaid, together with receipts for all moneys
paid by him or her as directed in the warrant or by this Charter. All taxes
or installments of taxes remaining unpaid for 30 days after the same or any
installment thereof which shall become due and payable shall bear interest
at the rate of 5% for the first month after the levy and an additional 1%
for each month and fraction thereof until paid, and such tax penalty and
interest may be paid to the Treasurer at any time before a sale of the lien
of such tax; but if paid after a notice of sale shall have been published as
provided in this chapter, the expense of the publication of such notice shall
be added to the amount of tax.
§ C4-13. Return and assessment roll as evidence.
The return of the unpaid taxes by the Treasurer or a copy thereof certified
by the Clerk under the corporate seal shall be presumptive evidence of the
facts stated therein. An assessment roll filed with the Clerk; or a copy of the
same, or any part thereof, certified by him or her under the corporate seal,
shall be presumptive evidence of the contents thereof, or the regularity of
the assessment, and of the right to levy such tax.
§ C4-14. Sales of tax liens and assessments.
The right of the Village of Ossining to receive taxes and special assessments
and the lien thereof may be sold by the Village and after such sale shall
be transferred in the manner provided in this Charter. The right and lien
so sold shall be called a "tax lien" and the instrument by which it is
assigned shall be called "transfer of tax lien." Whenever any tax on lands or
tenements or any assessment on lands or tenements for local improvements
levied subsequent to January 1, 1924 shall remain unpaid for 60 days after
the return of the Treasurer as provided in § C4-12 of this Charter, it shall
be lawful for the Village Treasurer to advertise the tax liens on said lands
and tenements or any of them for sale in the manner and for the period of
time hereinafter in this section provided. By such advertisement, the owner
or owners of said lands and tenements respectively shall be required to pay
the amount of such taxes and assessments with the penalties thereon, as
hereinbefore provided, so remaining unpaid, together with the charges of
such notice and advertisement, to the Treasurer of the Village, and notice
shall be given by such advertisement that if default shall be made in such
payment, the tax lien on such lands and tenements will be sold at public
auction at a day and place therein to be specified, for the lowest rate of
interest not exceeding 12% per annum, at which any person or persons
shall offer to take the same in consideration of advancing said taxes and
assessments and penalties as the case may be, together with the charges
of the above-mentioned notices and advertisements, and all other costs and
charges accrued thereon; and if notwithstanding such notice the owner or
owners shall refuse or neglect to pay such tax, assessment and penalties
and the charges attending such notice and advertisement, then it shall be
§ C4-12 CHARTER § C4-14
C:29
lawful for said Treasurer to cause such tax lien on such lands and tenements
to be sold at public auction for the purpose and in the manner expressed
in said advertisement, and such sale shall be made on the day and at
the place for that purpose mentioned in said advertisement, and shall be
continued from time to time, if necessary, until all the tax liens on the
lands and tenements so advertised shall be sold. Notice of such sale shall
be posted in at least five public places in the Village and published in the
official newspapers of the Village at least once a week for three successive
weeks next preceding the day fixed for such sale. Said notice, so posted
and published, as aforesaid, shall have appended thereto, a particular and
detailed statement of the property, the tax lien on which it is to be sold
by giving the section plate, block and lot number, together with such other
description, if any, the Treasurer shall direct. Such detailed statement and
description shall also give the total sum for the nonpayment of which a
tax lien is to be sold. No other notice or advertisement of the taxes or
assessment shall be required to authorize the sale of tax liens on any lands
or tenements as hereinbefore provided. The sale of tax liens under the
provisions of this Charter shall be held on the first Monday of May of each
year. [NOTE: §§ C4-14 through C4-36 apply only to those tax liens sold
prior to 1995. Sale of tax liens and foreclosures are superseded by §§ 1100
through 1186 of the Real Property Tax Law.]
§ C4-15. Postponement of sales.
It shall be lawful for the Treasurer to suspend or postpone any sale or sales
of tax liens on lands or tenements, or any portion thereof, which shall have
been advertised for sale to any time, but not more than 30 days from the
date of sale specified in any such advertisement. All sales which shall be so
postponed or suspended may be made without further advertisement other
than a general notice of such postponement to be published and posted as
in the last section provided for the original notice of such sale.
§ C4-16. Sale of liens to be conducted by the Treasurer.
The Treasurer shall conduct the sales hereinbefore provided to be made,
and no auctioneer other than the Treasurer shall be employed to make such
sale, and no fees shall be charged thereon. The Treasurer shall require from
each purchaser of a tax lien at the time of such sale, a deposit on account of
25% of the amount of the tax lien purchased by him, for which the Treasurer
shall give his or her receipt, and not later than 10 days from the date of the
sale, the balance shall be paid to the Treasurer at his or her office. If no bid
shall be received for a tax lien offered for sale, the Treasurer, for and on
behalf of the Village, shall bid in said tax lien, and upon such bid no deposit
or payment in cash shall be required from the Village. When the Village
has bid in any tax lien, a transfer of the tax lien shall be executed by the
Treasurer in the form and manner prescribed for other transfers of tax liens,
and the Village shall have the same rights in, to and under such transfer
of tax liens as purchaser as if the same had been bought by any other
person. The Treasurer at any time either before or after the institution of a
foreclosure action may accept a deed of conveyance of the property covered
§ C4-14 OSSINING CODE § C4-16
C:30
by the transfer of tax lien conveying to the Village the fee of said premises,
but such deed shall not be taken subject to any mortgage, lien, judgment or
other encumbrance, except current taxes, leases and restrictive covenants
of record. The Board of Trustees shall sell any such property so acquired
upon such terms and for such sums as the Board of Trustees may, by
resolution, fix and determine and said Board of Trustees on behalf of the
Village shall execute, acknowledge and deliver a deed therefor. Transfer
of tax lien shall be made and delivered to the purchaser without charge
upon the payments therein shown to be due. In case any purchaser shall not
complete his or her purchase in accordance with the terms prescribed as
herein provided, then the amount deposited by him or her at the time of said
sale shall be forfeited to the Village, and the entire tax lien upon the lands
affected by such purchase shall be sold again, such resale to be held at such
time as the Treasurer may direct, and notice thereof shall be posted and
published as hereinbefore provided for the original sale of such tax liens. All
deposits forfeited shall be paid to the Treasurer and by him or her credited
to the General Village Account.
§ C4-17. Transfer of tax liens.
A transfer of tax lien shall operate to transfer and assign the tax lien upon
the lands or tenements described therein for taxes and assessments and
penalties thereon, and the charges of the notices and advertisements given
pursuant to § C4-14 of this Charter, and all other costs and charges so
advertised for sale, but such tax lien so sold shall be subject to all taxes and
assessments which are still unpaid and due owing to the Village making the
sale, also subject to all taxes and special district assessments which have or
may become a lien subsequent to the lien of the taxes or assessments for
which the tax lien is sold, also subject to any and all subsequent transfers of
tax lien against said premises. A transfer of tax lien shall contain a transfer
and assignment by the Village of the tax lien so sold to the purchaser, the
date of the sale, the aggregate amount of the tax lien so transferred and the
items of taxes, assessments and penalties composing the tax lien, the annual
rate of interest which the purchaser has bid and will be entitled to receive,
the date when the amount of the tax lien will be due and the description
of the real property affected by the tax lien, and shall refer for certainty
to the designation of said property on the Official Map of the Village of
Ossining, by its section, block and lot number, and such other identifying
description as the Treasurer may deem proper to advertise. Each transfer
of tax lien shall be subscribed by or on behalf of the official making the
sale, or his or her successor in office, and shall be acknowledged by the
officer subscribing the same in the manner in which a deed is required to
be acknowledged, to be recorded in the county in which the real property
affected is situate.
§ C4-18. Record of transfer of tax liens.
The Treasurer of the Village shall keep in his or her office a public record
of sales of tax liens, and a copy of each transfer of tax lien issued by him or
her. Assignments of transfer of tax liens, duly acknowledged, may be filed
§ C4-16 CHARTER § C4-18
C:31
and recorded in the office of the Village Clerk. Assignments of transfer of
tax liens held by the Village shall be executed by the Treasurer. A transfer
of tax lien, and any assignment thereof duly acknowledged, shall be deemed
a conveyance under Article 8 of the Real Property Law and may be recorded
in the office of the recording officer of any county in which the real property
which it affects is situated. Transfers of tax liens and assignments thereof
shall be recorded by the recording officer in the same manner as mortgages
and assignments thereof, but without payment of the tax under Article 14
of the Tax Law. The record in the office of the Village Clerk of sales of tax
liens; of a transfer of tax lien and a copy of a transfer of tax lien; and of an
assignment of tax lien duly acknowledged in the office of a recording officer
shall be evidence in any court of the state without further proof. A transcript
of any record enumerated in this section, duly certified, shall be evidence in
any court in the state with like effect as the original instrument of record.
Neither the tax lien nor the rights transferred or created by a transfer of tax
lien shall be impaired by failure of a recording officer to record a transfer of
tax lien made by the Village through the Treasurer.
§ C4-19. Rights of purchaser of tax lien.
The aggregate amount of each tax lien transferred pursuant to this title
shall be due three years from the date of the sale. Until such aggregate
amount is fully paid and discharged, the holder of the transfer of tax lien
shall be entitled to receive interest on such aggregate amount from the
date of the sale, semiannually on the first day of June and December, at
the rate which the purchaser shall have bid. At the option of the holder of
any transfer of tax lien, the aggregate amount thereof shall become due
and payable after default in the payment of interest for 90 days or after
default of three months after the date of sale of the tax lien in the payment
of any taxes and assessments for which the tax lien so held is sold. A
person may pay the Treasurer such principal with interest at the rate bid
up to that day, three months after such payment, together with all taxes
and assessments, including interest acquired from the sale or lease of the
premises for the same, which are still unpaid and due and owing to the
Village as of the date of the taxes for which such tax lien has been sold.
In case such payment is made to the Treasurer, he or she shall receive the
amount of the tax lien and interest for the benefit of the holder of the tax
lien thus discharged and the balance, if any, for the Village and shall give
notice thereof to the purchaser or the personal representative or assignee
of the purchaser, by mail, addressed to such address as may have been
furnished to the Treasurer. Upon receiving surrender of such transfer of tax
lien, together with necessary certificate of cancellation, the Treasurer shall
pay the amount of the tax lien and interest thus deposited to the person
who, according to the records of his or her office, appears to be entitled
thereto, or to the personal representative of such person.
§ C4-20. Discharge of tax liens.
A tax lien pursuant to the provisions of this title must be discharged upon
the record thereof by the Treasurer when payment is made to him or
§ C4-18 OSSINING CODE § C4-20
C:32
her of the principal and interest, together with all taxes and assessments,
including interest acquired from the sale or lease of the premises for the
same, which are still unpaid and due and owing to the Village as of the date
of the taxes for which such tax lien has been sold, as provided in the last
preceding section, and also when the transfer of tax lien is surrendered to
him or her for cancellation and there is presented to him or her a certificate
executed by the purchaser, or the personal representative or assignee of the
purchaser, acknowledged so as to be entitled to be recorded in the county
in which the real property affected by such lien is situated, certifying that
the tax lien has been paid or has been otherwise satisfied and discharged.
The transfer of tax lien thus surrendered and such certificate of discharge
must be filed by the Treasurer and he or she must note upon the margin
of the record of sale, upon such transfer of tax lien, and upon the copy of
the transfer of tax lien kept in his or her office, a minute of such discharge
and the date of filing thereof. If the transfer of tax lien shall have been
lost or destroyed or mutilated, if payment is made to the Treasurer, or if a
certificate of discharge is filed as hereinafter provided, application for an
order dispensing with the surrender of the transfer of tax lien may be made
in the same manner as is provided in § 270 of the Real Property Law, the
provisions of which, so far as the same may be, are hereby made applicable
to discharge of tax liens. The Treasurer shall, upon demand, issue his or
her certificates showing the discharge of any tax lien which may have been
fully discharged as provided in this section, and such certificate may be filed
in any office where the transfer of tax lien is recorded, and any recording
officer with whom such certificate is filed shall record the same, and upon
the margin of the record of such transcript of tax lien in his or her office
shall note a statement that the same has been discharged with a reference
to the record of such certificate in his or her office.
§ C4-21. Exemption from taxation.
Tax liens and transfers of tax liens shall be exempt from taxation by the
state or local subdivision thereof, except from the taxes imposed by Article
10 of the Tax Law. The real property affected by any tax lien shall not be
exempt from taxation by reason of this section.
§ C4-22. Foreclosure of tax liens.
A. If the amount of any tax lien which shall have been transferred by a
transfer of tax lien shall not be paid, as in this Charter provided, or
redeemed after notice as in this Charter provided, when under the
terms and provisions of this Charter and of transfer of tax lien, such
amount shall be due, the holder of such tax lien may maintain an action
in the Supreme Court or in the County Court of Westchester County to
foreclose such tax lien. No action to foreclose a tax lien shall be
instituted hereunder unless the holder of such tax lien shall have served
notice to redeem upon the record owner or owners of the premises
affected by such lien, also upon the mortgagee or mortgagees affected
by such tax lien. Such notice to redeem shall be of no force and effect if
served prior to the occurrence of the defaults under which the lien
§ C4-20 CHARTER § C4-22
C:33
described in said notice may be foreclosed in pursuance of this Charter.
Said notice to redeem shall require the persons served to pay the
amount due under such transfer of tax lien to the Treasurer or the
holder of such transfer of tax lien within 30 days from the service
of such notice and shall set forth a verified statement of the amount
required for redemption, which shall consist of the amount due on
account of such tax lien with interest at the rate bid up to the date of
the expiration of said thirty-day period, together with disbursements
actually made or incurred not exceeding $10 for all authorized searches
for each tax parcel and disbursement for postage. The notice shall be
served by registered mail, addressed to the last known address, if any,
as shown by the records of the office of the Treasurer and/or in the
office of the Register of the County of Westchester. In the event that
such records fail to disclose the names of such owners or mortgagees
or fails to disclose the addresses of any such owners or mortgagees, the
Treasurer shall, at the request of the owner of such transfer of tax lien
or his or her or its representative, post such notice in his or her office
and upon the expiration of 30 days from the date of such posting the
transfer of tax lien holder shall have the same rights as if the registered
notice was given as herein provided. In an action to foreclose a tax
lien, any person shall be a proper party of whom the plaintiff alleges
that such person has or may have or whom the plaintiff has reason to
believe such person has or may have an interest in or claim upon the
real property affected by the tax lien. Except as otherwise provided in
this title, an action to foreclose a tax lien shall be regulated by the
provisions of the Civil Practice Law and Rules; and include the right to
the appointment of a receiver of the rents and profits as in the case of
the foreclosure of a mortgage, and by all other provisions of law, and
rules of practice applicable to actions to foreclose mortgages on real
property. The people of the State of New York may be made a party to
an action to foreclose a tax lien in the same manner as a natural person.
Where the people of the State of New York or the Village is made a party
defendant, the complaint shall set forth, in addition to the other matters
required to be set forth by law, detailed facts showing the particular
nature of the interest in or the lien on said real property of the people
of the State of New York or the Village, and detailed facts showing the
particular nature of the interest in or the lien on said real property
which plaintiff has reason to believe that the people of the State of
New York or the Village has or may have in said real property, and the
reason for making the people of the State of New York or the Village
a party defendant. Upon the failure to state such facts, the complaint
shall be dismissed as to the people of the State of New York or the
Village. Separate transfer of tax liens against the same lot or against
two or more lots or parcels of land may be foreclosed in one action.
In the event that any defendant to such an action desires to have the
action severed, an order to that effect may be granted upon due notice
to the plaintiff and continued as to such defendant or defendants under
such conditions as the Court may provide or the complaint dismissed
as to such defendants, but without costs, or it may be severed on the
§ C4-22 OSSINING CODE § C4-22
C:34
§ C4-23. Pleading transfer of tax lien.
Whenever a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is for the foreclosure
of a tax lien or is in any manner founded upon a tax lien or a transfer of tax
lien, the production in evidence of an instrument executed by the Treasurer,
in the form prescribed in § C4-20 for a transfer of tax lien subscribed
by or in behalf of the Treasurer shall be presumptive evidence that the
lien purported to be transferred by such an instrument was a valid and
enforceable lien, and that it has been duly assigned to the purchaser, and
it shall not be necessary to plead or prove any act, proceeding, notice or
action preceding the delivery of such transfer of tax lien nor to establish
the validity of the tax lien transferred by such transfer of tax lien. If a party
or person in interest in any action or proceeding claims that a tax lien is
irregular or invalid, or that there is any defect therein or that a transfer
of tax lien is irregular, invalid or defective, such invalidity, irregularity or
defect must be specifically pleaded or set forth, and must be established
affirmatively by the party or person pleading or setting forth the same.
§ C4-24. Judgment upon tax lien.
In every action for the foreclosure of a tax lien, and in every action or
proceeding in which a cause of action, defense or counterclaim is in any
manner founded upon a tax lien or transfer of tax lien, such transfer of tax
lien and the tax lien which it transfers shall be presumed to be regular and
valid and effectual to the purchaser named therein a valid and enforceable
tax lien. Unless in such action or proceeding such tax lien or transfer of tax
lien is found to be invalid, they shall be adjudged to be enforceable and valid
application of the plaintiff as to one or more defendants upon due
notice to such defendants as to which the severance is sought who
have appeared but upon such conditions as the Court may provide, or
the complaint dismissed as to such defendants but without costs. A
description of the property, by section, block, lot, subdivision, or other
description, as shown on the tax map used in the tax rolls and shown in
the transfer of tax lien, shall be sufficient for such foreclosure.
B. The referee or other official making the sale shall sell each parcel
shown on the tax map, tax roll or transfer of lien parcel separately,
except that he or she may sell adjoining parcels with a frontage of not to
exceed 75 feet in width on the street front together, but the Court in
and by the judgment may direct such other or different method as may
seem just and proper. The referee or other official making the sale may
insert such additional description in the deed as to him or her shall
seem proper for convenience of record identification.
C. The attorney for the plaintiff in the foreclosure or transfer of tax lien
shall append to the notice of sale the approximate amount, including
penalties and interest due for unpaid real property taxes and
assessments, including the amount due on the transfer of tax lien being
foreclosed which are a lien against the premises so being sold.
§ C4-22 CHARTER § C4-24
C:35
for the amount thereof, and the interest to which the holder may be entitled
and a tax lien transferred by a transfer of tax lien effectual to transfer such
tax lien to the purchaser named therein.
§ C4-25. Judgment of foreclosure of tax liens. [Amended 8-3-1999
by L.L. No. 1-1999]
A. In an action to foreclose a tax lien, unless the defendants obtain
judgment, the plaintiff shall be entitled to a judgment establishing the
validity of the tax lien so far as the same shall not be adjudged invalid
and of the transfer of tax lien, and directing the sale of the real property
affected thereby, or such part thereof as shall be sufficient to discharge
the tax lien, or such items thereof as shall not be adjudged invalid and
the interest thereon and all other accrued taxes, assessments and water
rents affecting the real property together with the expenses of the sale
and the costs of the action, except that the fees and/or allowances to a
referee or other official appointed to compute shall not exceed $25
unless there are five or more tax parcels in the action, in which event
the allowance shall not exceed $35, and the fee and/or allowance to the
referee or other official appointed to sell shall be at not to exceed the
rate allowed to the referee appointed to compute. Costs in any
foreclosure action brought under the provisions of this Charter shall be
in the discretion of the court, but in no event shall costs exceed the sum
of $35 unless there are five or more separate tax parcels included in
one action in which event the costs shall not exceed $55. The award of
costs in any action shall carry with it the right to recover taxable
disbursements, together with such amount as the court shall allow for
authorized searches not to exceed $25 for each tax parcel included in
the action. The judgment of foreclosure shall direct the payment of the
costs, disbursements and expenses of the foreclosure action; all taxes
and special district assessments, and penalties payable to the Treasurer
under this Charter, also all liens or transfers of tax liens for same which
are a lien against the premises so sold subsequent to the taxes or
assessments covered by the lien so foreclosed, or that the tax parcel is
sold subject thereto and if sold subject thereto, the notice of sale shall
state the approximate amount thereof including penalties and interest;
all taxes and assessments, including interest acquired from the sale or
lease of the premises for the same, which are still unpaid and due and
owing to the Village making the sale as of the date of the taxes for
which such tax lien has been sold, or that the tax parcel shall be sold
subject thereto and if sold subject thereto, the notice of sale shall state

the amount of the tax lien foreclosed with interest thereon. In the event
that the Village is the plaintiff, the holder of any Village tax lien
affecting the tax parcel sought to be sold shall be made a party to the
action and such tax lien shall be sold free and clear of all Village tax

§ C4-26. Effect of judgment foreclosing tax lien. [Amended 8-3-1999
by L.L. No. 1-1999]
Every final judgment in an action to foreclose a tax lien shall be binding
upon, and every conveyance upon a sale pursuant thereto shall transfer to
and vest in the purchaser all the right, title, interest and estate in claim
upon the real property affected by such judgment of the plaintiff, each
defendant upon whom the summons is served, each person claiming from,
through or under such a defendant by title accruing after the filing of notice
of pendency of the action or after the entry of judgment and filing of the
judgment roll in proper County Clerk's office, and each person not in being
when the judgment is rendered, who afterwards may become entitled to a
beneficial interest attaching to, or an estate or interest in such real property
or any portion thereof, provided that the person presumptively entitled to
such beneficial interest, estate or interest, is a party to such action or bound
by such judgment. So much of § 317 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules
as requires the court to allow a defendant to defend an action after final

in court for a period of upwards of three months and no application has been
made therefor that the same shall be invested at interest for the benefit of
the person or persons entitled thereto, to be paid upon the direction of the
court.
§ C4-28. Payments after foreclosure of tax lien has commenced.
[Amended 8-3-1999 by L.L. No. 1-1999]
Any party to an action to foreclose a tax lien or any purchaser or any party
in interest may give notice of such foreclosure to the Village Treasurer at
any time after the action has been commenced and, upon receiving such
dates of the lien of such taxes and assessments. The judgment of
foreclosure and sale shall also recite the transfer of the tax lien and
each assignment thereof and, unless such transfer of tax lien and each
assignment thereof has been fully recorded in the office of register, the
same shall be attached to and form a part of the judgment.
B. In the event that the owners of one or more parcels are joined as
defendants, the judgment of foreclosure and sale shall provide for an
equitable division of the costs and disbursements against each parcel to
be sold in said judgment provided.
§ C4-25 CHARTER § C4-28
C:37
notice, said Village Treasurer shall not be authorized to receive on behalf
of any party the sum or sums to satisfy his or her said lien, as provided in
and pursuant to the provisions of § C4-19 of this Charter. Any person having
a legal or beneficial interest in property affected by such foreclosure may
satisfy the same by paying at any time before judgment $25 for costs and
taxable disbursements, together with all other amounts which are directed
or required to be paid pursuant to § C4-25 hereof.
§ C4-29. Reimbursement for defective tax liens.
If a transfer of tax lien is vacated or is set aside, canceled, or if it is
adjudged in any action that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective or
not sufficient to transfer a tax lien to the purchaser thereof or if in any
action to foreclose a tax lien it is adjudged that the entire tax lien is void
and not a valid lien on the premises which it purports to affect, and that
the complaint is dismissed, the purchaser may surrender such transfer of
tax lien together with a certified copy of such judgment or decree to the
Treasurer and thereupon shall be repaid by the Village the amount paid for
such transfer of tax lien, with interest from the time of such payment at
the rate set forth in the transfer of tax lien, and the Village shall pay the
taxed costs and disbursements of any action or proceeding in which such
adjudication is made.
§ C4-30. Reimbursement when part of tax lien is defective.
If, in any action to foreclose a tax lien, it shall be adjudged that some, but
not all, of the items constituting such tax lien are void and not a valid lien
on the premises covered by such tax lien or if in any action or proceeding
it is adjudged that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective, as to some,
though not as to all of the items transferred, the holder of the transfer of
tax lien, by instrument, in writing, duly acknowledged, shall retransfer to
the Village the items thus affected and shall be repaid by the Village such
portion of the amount paid for such transfer of tax lien as may be applicable
to the items thus affected, with interest from the time of such payment at
the rate set forth in the transfer of tax lien and the town shall pay the taxed
costs and disbursements of any action or proceeding, other than an action
to foreclose the tax lien, in which such adjudication is made.
§ C4-31. Owner may question transfer of tax liens.
Any person interested in or holding a lien upon any real property affected
by any unpaid tax lien or transfer of tax lien may file a written notice with
the Treasurer claiming that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective or
that a tax lien which has been transferred pursuant to this title or which
is advertised to be transferred is invalid, defective, void or ineffectual, or
should be vacated or set aside. The Treasurer shall examine into the facts
and proceedings resulting in the tax lien or transfer of tax lien mentioned
in such notice; before a determination is had the Treasurer shall serve a
copy of such notice upon the holder of the transfer of tax lien which is thus
questioned or which transfer the items thus questioned and shall give such
§ C4-28 OSSINING CODE § C4-31
C:38
holder an opportunity to be heard. The Treasurer, if he or she concludes that
a defense in action to foreclose the tax lien would succeed in whole or in
part, shall so certify to the Village Board, and shall recommend what action
shall be taken by the Village concerning the same. If the Village Board shall
by resolution conclude that such defense would succeed in whole or in part
and recommend repayment by the Village of the amount paid for a transfer
of a tax lien which would be applicable to any item, and if it is approved by
the Treasurer the Village shall require the surrender of the transfer of tax
lien or the retransfer of it of the item or items or tax lien which are found to
be void or defective and shall make repayment therefor in the same manner
as if such transfer of tax lien, or items has been adjudicated in the manner
provided in §§ C4-29 and C4-30. Neither the provisions of this section nor
any act or proceeding thereunder shall impair or in any manner affect the
rights or remedies of any person interested in or holding any lien upon real
property to question the validity of any tax, assessment, water rents or tax
lien or any part or item of any tax lien.
§ C4-32. Treasurer to protect interest of the Village.
No claim shall be made against the Village under §§ C4-29, C4-30 and C4-31
by the holder of any tax lien, unless action to foreclose the tax lien or
transfer of tax lien upon which such claim is founded is commenced within
five years from the time of sale resulting in such transfer of tax lien, nor
shall any claim be made against the Village under §§ C4-29 and C4-30 unless
within 10 days after the commencement of any action or proceeding to
vacate, set aside or cancel a transfer of tax lien or a tax lien, or an item
mentioned in a transfer of tax lien, or unless within 10 days after the service
of any pleadings or other paper in an action or proceeding in which any
transfer of tax lien or item mentioned in a transfer of tax lien is brought into
question, sought to be set aside, vacated or canceled or which sets forth or
pleads any defense to an action to foreclose a tax lien, a notice in writing
to be served upon the Treasurer of the Village setting forth the question or
objection raised to the best knowledge of the holder of the transfer of tax
lien, or his or her attorney at law, and demanding that the Village take up
the prosecution or defense of the action or proceeding. All proceedings in
such action or proceeding shall be stayed for 30 days or such shorter time
as the Treasurer or the attorney representing him shall stipulate, in writing.
It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to examine or cause to be examined
the questions raised, and, in order to protect the interests of the Village,
the attorney for the Village shall have the right to be substituted for the
attorney of record of the holder of the transfer of tax lien, or to appear as
attorney of record for the holder of any such transfer of tax lien, to conduct
or defend any such action or proceeding in the name of the holder of the
transfer of tax lien, and to bring any other action or proceeding for, on
behalf of and in the name of the holder of such transfer of tax lien as he
or she may deem advisable, to take appeals and to argue appeals taken by
the adverse party as he or she may deem advisable. It shall be the duty of
the Treasurer to protect the interest of the Village in all matters, actions
and proceedings relating to tax liens and transfers of tax liens; to intervene
on behalf of the Village or of the holder of a transfer of a tax lien, in or
§ C4-31 CHARTER § C4-32
C:39
to make the Village a party to any action, in which he or she believes it to
be in the interest of the Village to do so, by reason of any matter arising
under or relating to any tax lien or transfer of tax lien, or advertisement of
sale of tax liens. In any action or proceeding in which the attorney for the
Village pursuant to this section shall be substituted, or shall appear, it shall
be without expense to the holder of the transfer of tax lien, and all costs
recovered on behalf of such holder of a transfer of tax lien in any action
or proceeding conducted or defended by the attorney shall belong to the
Village and shall be collected, applied and disposed of in the manner as are
other costs recovered by the Village. Upon the foreclosure of any transfer
of a tax lien held by the Village, the Treasurer shall have the right to bid
in and take title on behalf of the Village of the property so sold, provided
always that the amount of the bid does not exceed the amount it would be
necessary for the property to bring in order to protect the interest of the
Village after paying all previous charges in accordance with the terms of the
judgment. The Treasurer shall sell any property so bought upon such terms
and for such sum as the Village Board may, by resolution, fix and determine,
and give a deed therefor.
§ C4-33. Defective or invalid transfer of tax lien.
If a transfer of tax lien is vacated or set aside or canceled or if it is adjudged
that a transfer of tax lien is invalid or defective, or insufficient to transfer
a tax lien to the purchaser thereof or if in any action to foreclose a tax lien
it is adjudged that a tax lien is not a valid lien on the premises which it
purports to affect because of some irregularity in the proceedings and, if
in pursuance of any such adjudication, the purchaser of said transfer of tax
lien shall have surrendered such transfer of tax lien to the Treasurer and
shall have been repaid by the Village, the amount paid for such transfer
of tax lien, with interest and costs and disbursements of said action or
proceedings in which such adjudication was made, then and in that event
the tax lien which was purported to be transferred and assigned in such
transfer of tax lien shall remain as a valid lien upon the premises which
it affects, except to such extent as it may have been adjudged irregular or
invalid, and the Treasurer shall proceed to sell anew, as provided in § C4-14
of this Charter, so much of said tax lien as is not invalid as if no prior sale
purporting to transfer said tax lien had taken place.
§ C4-34. Loss, transfer of tax lien.
Whenever any transfer of tax lien given by the Treasurer as in the title
provided shall be lost, the Treasurer may receive evidence of such loss, and
on satisfactory proof of the fact may execute and deliver a duplicate to such
person or persons who shall appear entitled thereto, and may also, in his or
her discretion, require a bond of indemnity to the Village.
§ C4-35. Limitation of right to attack sales under tax foreclosure.
An action cannot be maintained to recover real estate hereafter sold under
a judgment or in an action brought to foreclose a lien of a tax, or to foreclose
§ C4-32 OSSINING CODE § C4-35
C:40
the equity of redemption remaining for the sale thereof for a tax, or to
recover any right, title, interest or equity of redemption in or to real estate
so sold unless the action therefor is commenced within one year after the
entry of judgment of foreclosure and sale in case of sales hereafter had
and within one year from the time this Charter takes effect in case of sale
or leases heretofore had. The limitations herein provided apply to and bar
nonresident persons, persons temporarily absent from the state, minors,
insane persons, persons in prison and all other persons and corporations
whether under disability or not.
§ C4-36. Saving clause.
Sections C4-14 through C4-35 of this Charter, as added, shall not affect or
impair any act done or right accruing, accrued or acquired, nor any penalty
of forfeiture incurred prior to the time when this amendment takes effect by
virtue of any sale of an interest in property heretofore made in pursuance of
any section of Chapter 667 of the Laws of 1910, amended by this Charter,
but such right, penalty or forfeiture may be asserted, enforced, prosecuted
or inflicted as fully and to the same extent as if said amendment had not
been passed; no tax leases heretofore issued nor any tax sale heretofore
had shall be affected by said amendment, but the rights of all persons
with respect thereto shall be the same as if the amendment had not been
passed, except as in this Charter otherwise provided, and all actions, suits,
proceedings or prosecutions pending when this amendment takes effect
may be prosecuted and defended to final determination in the same manner
as they might prior to the time when this amendment takes effect.

After the lapse of 30 days from the return of the Treasurer, an action may
be maintained by the Village to recover the amount of an unpaid tax or
assessment, together with 5% thereof, and interest from the time of such
return at the rate of 10% per annum. A judgment in such action for any
amount when docketed in the office of the County Clerk of the County
of Westchester shall be a lien upon the real property of the defendant.
Supplementary proceedings may also be taken for such tax in accordance
with the provisions of the Tax Law.

the costs, if any, allowed in such proceeding.
§ C5-19. Changing grade of street or bridge.
If the Village has exclusive control and jurisdiction of a street or bridge
therein, it may change the grade thereof. If such change of grade shall
injuriously affect any building or land adjacent thereto or the use thereof,
the change of grade to the extent of the damage resulting therefrom shall
be deemed the taking of such adjacent property for a public use. A person
claiming damages from such change of grade must present to the Board
of Trustees a verified claim therefor within 60 days after such change of
grade is effected. The Board may agree with such owner upon the amount
of damages to be allowed to him or her. If no agreement is made within
30 days after the presentation of the claim, the person presenting it may
apply to the Supreme Court for the appointment of three Commissioners
to determine the compensation to which he or she is entitled. Notice of
the application must be served upon the Board of Trustees at least 10 days
before the hearing thereof. All proceedings subsequent to the appointment
of the Commissioners shall be taken in accordance with the Condemnation
Law, so far as applicable, except that the Commissioners in fixing their
award may make an allowance for benefits derived by the claimant from
such improvement. The amount agreed upon for damages or the award
§ C5-15 OSSINING CODE § C5-19

therefor, together with costs, allowed to the claimant shall be a charge
against the Village.
§ C5-20. Snow and ice on sidewalks.
The Board of Trustees may require the owners or occupants of land fronting
on sidewalks and footpaths within the Village of Ossining to keep such
sidewalks and footpaths and the gutters in front thereof clear of snow
and ice. Upon the failure of such owners or occupants of land fronting on
sidewalks and public footpaths to obey any local law requiring the clearing
of snow and ice from sidewalks, footpaths or gutters, the Board of Trustees
may cause such sidewalks, public footpaths or gutters to be cleared and
assess the expense thereof upon such adjoining land.

upon streets to keep the portion of the street between the land and the
curbline of the street cleared of rubbish or other accumulations thereon,
injurious to the use or appearance thereof, and to cause all grass and weeds
thereon to be cut. If the owner of such adjoining land shall fail to comply
with such requirement, the Board of Trustees may cause such work to be
done, and assess the expense thereof upon such adjoining land.6
§ C5-22. Trimming trees. [Amended 8-3-1999 by L.L. No. 1-1999]

or occupant of such property, stating that such expenditure has been made,
its purpose and amount and that at a specified time and place it will meet
to make an assessment of the expenditure upon such land. The Board
shall meet at the time and place in such notice specified. It shall hear and
determine all objections that may be made to such assessment, including
the amount thereof, and shall assess upon the land the amount which it

§ C5-27. Contracts for paving; how placed.
Prior to contracting for any work, a plan and accurate specifications of the
work proposed to be constructed must be prepared and placed in the office
of the Village Clerk for public inspection. The Board of Trustees shall then
fix a district of assessment of the property in the judgment of said Board
benefited by said macadamizing or paving, and beyond which district the
assessment for 1/3 of such cost of macadamizing or paving shall not extend,
and shall then cause to be published in the official newspapers, a notice that
on a day therein to be named, at least two weeks from the first publication
thereof, it will act in relation to the work proposed to be constructed, and in
the meantime, sealed proposals for constructing the work will be received
by the Village Clerk. Upon the day mentioned in the notice, or upon such
subsequent day as said Board of Trustees shall adjourn to for that purpose,
the Mayor of the Village, or in his or her absence, the presiding officer
shall in, the presence of the Board of Trustees, open such proposals. No

making such bid, to the effect that, if the bid is accepted, they will furnish
and deliver to the Village a bond of a surety company in a penalty to be
fixed by the Board of Trustees, conditioned for the construction of the work
at the price and upon the terms proposed within such reasonable time as
the Board of Trustees shall limit and subject to supervision and approval
of said Board of Trustees. Said Board may, by a vote of the majority of all
its members, to be ascertained by taking and recording the ayes and nays,
direct the construction of the proposed work and accept the most favorable
bidder; provided, however, that if any street, avenue or highway in said

the official newspapers, once in each week, for two successive weeks, a
notice that the report has been completed and so deposited and that they
will meet at a time and place therein to be specified not less than 10 days
from the first publication of said notice, to review their report. At such time
and place, the parties interested can be heard, and thereafter said Trustees
shall review the report, correct the same when necessary, and file it with
the Village Clerk with all the objections, in writing, which have been left
with them by the parties interested. And upon the filing of such report, the
§ C5-26 CHARTER § C5-28

gutters and the construction of such drains, as may be deemed necessary,
on such streets, avenues or highways as they shall determine to
macadamize or pave, of such character and material as the Board by
resolution may determine, and the cost thereof shall be considered as part
of the cost of said macadamizing or paving, and such curbing, guttering
and drains may be included in any contract let by the Board of Trustees for
the macadamizing or paving of any streets, avenue or highway; provided,
however, that the entire cost of relaying existing concrete, slate or granite
curbing which has not been damaged by any owner or occupant of the
property benefited, which is installed on or after January 1, 1984, shall be a

Village, the Trustees are hereby empowered to acquire the same in like
manner, and by like proceedings as are provided for by this Charter or by
general statute for the laying out of public and private roads and of the
alteration and discontinuance thereof, but the taking of any private property
for sewerage purposes shall not exempt the owners of adjacent lands from
assessments for the benefits deemed to have accrued by the construction of
any such sewers, and all damages to be paid for the taking of such private
property shall be added to the cost of making and laying such sewer.

is to be assessed upon the lands benefited or to be benefited, the Trustees
shall prepare and file in the office of the Village Clerk a map and plan of
the proposed area of local assessment and such expense shall thereupon
be apportioned upon the lands within such area in proportion as nearly as
may be, to the benefit which each lot or parcel will derive therefrom and the
ratio of such benefit shall be established. After making such apportionment
the Trustees shall publish a notice in the official newspapers once in each

thereon the day, hour and minute of such filing, and from the time of such
filing, the assessment shall be a lien upon the property assessed and shall
publish once in the official papers a notice of the filing of such completed
apportionment. Such apportionment shall be deemed final and conclusive
unless an appeal is taken therefrom within 30 days after the publication
of notice of the filing thereof, and affidavits of publication of such notice
of filing shall be filed with the Village Clerk and shall be legal evidence

pay the full amount of their assessment at once or at any time not exceeding
10 years from the date of the publication of such notice or in 10 equal
installments, payable annually, beginning one year from the date of the
publication of such notice. Any assessments not paid within 30 days after
the publication of such notice shall bear interest and the amount of such
assessments and the interest thereon shall be a lien upon the property
assessed, enforceable in the same manner as liens for general Village taxes.
Any property owner who desires to avail himself of the privilege of paying
the assessment upon his or her property in a lump sum, but later than
30 days after the publication of such notice, must notify the Board, in
writing, of his or her intention to do so not later than 30 days after the
publication of such notice, and, in the absence of such notification, his or
her assessment shall be payable in 10 equal annual installments bearing
interest from the date of publication of such notice as above provided. Any
owner of property assessed may at any time petition the Board of Trustees
for apportionment of the assessment upon two or more subdivisions of any
parcel or lot assessed as a unit, and it shall be the duty of the Board of
Trustees, if practicable, to make such apportionment and file a statement
of the same in the office of the Village Clerk which shall be attached to the
original apportionment, and the original apportionment shall be deemed to
§ C6-6 CHARTER § C6-7
C:57

or her assessment in full or, if any installment or installments thereof have
been paid, the balance of his or her installment is not then due, at any time
by paying the same to the Treasurer together with the interest due thereon.

and expense of the construction of sewers to be paid for by assessments
for benefit at maturity shall be created, into which shall be paid all of the
amounts received, both principal and interest from the assessments for the
improvement for which the bonds are issued, and out of this sinking fund
the principal and interest of such bonds shall be paid so far as the sinking
fund is sufficient to meet the same.8

§ 8-3. Purpose.
A. Civilian involvement in the review of police practices has been
spreading rapidly throughout the United States, as well as several
countries overseas. Although a complaint process that is a strictly

leave community concerns about the effectiveness and integrity of
investigations unanswered. The Board of Trustees has determined that
in order to provide for civilian participation in the complaint review
process it is in the best interest of the Village of Ossining to establish a
Civilian Police Complaint Review Board and promulgate policies,
procedures, rules and regulations for the operation thereof. This
chapter is adopted in order to promote public confidence in the ability
of the Village of Ossining to provide a governmental structure to fairly
investigate, review and dispose of civilian complaints made against its
police officers, giving due regard for the rights and interests of both the
civilians and police officers involved. The Civilian Police Complaint
Review Board is one step in building a partnership between the police
and the community based on trust and mutual respect.

Board to amend or repeal this manual or the local law creating the
Civilian Police Complaint Review Board.

any nonmember, nor allow any nonmember to discuss any information
relevant to a pending complaint with them.

dismissal by the Village Board and constitute a violation of local law
that may subject the member to civil and/or criminal liability.

and therefore would be required to conduct any disciplinary hearings
arising out of complaints reviewed by the CPCRB, Village Board

§ 8-13 OSSINING CODE § 10-1
C:104
A. It is the policy of both the Village of Ossining and the State of New York
to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of economic
development, to promote deeper penetration of energy efficiency and
renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, and wider
deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine the
retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for
residential and small commercial customers in those markets. Among
the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is
community choice aggregation, which allows local governments to
determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on behalf of
its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments, including the Village of Ossining, to procure energy
supply service for their residential and small commercial customers,
who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement, while
maintaining transmission and distribution service from the existing
distribution utility. This chapter establishes a program that will allow
the Village of Ossining to put out for bid the total amount of natural gas
and/or electricity being purchased by local residential and small
commercial customers. Bundled customers will have the opportunity to
have more control to lower their overall energy costs, to spur clean
energy innovation and investment, to improve customer choice and
value, and to protect the environment; thereby, fulfilling the purposes of
this chapter and fulfilling an important public purpose.
C. The Village of Ossining is authorized to implement this "Community
Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program" pursuant to Section
10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; and State of
New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0564, Petition of
Sustainable Westchester for Expedited Approval for the
Implementation of a Pilot Community Choice Aggregation Program
within the County of Westchester, Order Granting Petition in Part
(issued February 26, 2015) as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0564 (collectively, the "order"). "Order" shall
also mean orders of the Public Service Commission related to State of
New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding
on Motion of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation
Programs (issued December 15, 2014) to the extent that orders related
to Case No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the Village of Ossining not
otherwise permitted pursuant to orders related to Case No. 14-M-0564;
provided, however, that in the event of any conflict between orders from
Case No. 14-M-0564 and orders from Case No. 14-M-0224, orders from
Case No. 14-M-0564 shall govern the CCA Program.
D. This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Community
Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program Law of the Village of Ossining."
§ 10-1 CHARTER § 10-2
C:105
§ 10-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this chapter, and unless otherwise expressly stated or
unless the context otherwise requires, the terms in this chapter shall have
the meanings employed in the State of New York Public Service
Commission's Uniform Business Practices or, if not so defined there, as
indicated below:
BUNDLED CUSTOMERS  Residential and small commercial customers of
electricity or natural gas ("fuels") who are purchasing the fuels from the
distribution utility.
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION PROGRAM or CCA PROGRAM 
A municipal energy procurement program, which replaces the incumbent
utility as the default supplier for all bundled customers within the Village of
Ossining.
DISTRIBUTION UTILITY  Owner or controller of the means of distribution
of the natural gas or electricity that is regulated by the Public Service
Commission.
PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION  New York State Public Service
Commission.
SMALL COMMERCIAL  Nonresidential customers as permitted by the
order.
SUPPLIERS  Energy service companies ("ESCOs") that procure electric
power and natural gas for bundled customers in connection with this

established by the Village of Ossining, whereby the Village of Ossining
shall work together with Sustainable Westchester to implement the
CCA Program to the full extent permitted by the order, as set forth more
fully herein. The Village of Ossining's role under the CCA Program
involves the aggregating of the energy and/or gas supply of its residents
and the entering into a contract with one or more suppliers for supply
and services. Under the CCA Program, the operation and ownership of
the utility service shall remain with the distribution utility.
B. The Village of Ossining's purchase of energy supply through a CCA
Program constitutes neither the purchase of a public utility system, nor
the furnishing of utility service. The Village of Ossining will not take
over any part of the electric or gas transmission or distribution system
and will not furnish any type of utility service, but will instead negotiate

one or more requests for proposals to suppliers to provide energy to
participants and may then award a contract in accordance with the CCA
Program.

chooses, will then request individual customer data from the
distribution utility in accordance with the CCA Program.
D. Sustainable Westchester or the Village of Ossining, if the Village so
chooses, and the selected supplier will then notify bundled customers of
the contract terms and their opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
E. In accordance with and for purposes of the order, the existing
distribution utility, Consolidated Edison Company of New York, Inc., will
provide to Sustainable Westchester aggregate and customer-specific
data (including usage data, capacity tag obligations, account numbers,
and service addresses) of all bundled customers in the Village of
Ossining not currently enrolled with an ESCO.

residential and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the
Village's decision to establish the CCA Program, of the contract terms
with an ESCO, and of the opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
B. The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and explain the CCA Program and the

D. CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling

supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential customers
are entitled to the added protection of the mandated three-day
rescission period as detailed in Section 5(B)(3) of the Uniform Business
Practices.

§ 12-3 OSSINING CODE § 17-1
C:112
§ 17-2. Purpose.
Pursuant to the provisions of § 806 of the General Municipal Law, the Board
of Trustees of the Village of Ossining recognizes that there are rules of
ethical conduct for public officers and employees which must be observed
if a high degree of moral conduct is to be obtained and if public confidence
is to be maintained in our unit of local government. It is the purpose of this
chapter to promulgate these rules of ethical conduct for the officers and
employees of the Village of Ossining. These rules shall serve as a guide for
official conduct of the officers and employees of the Village of Ossining. The
rules of ethical conduct of this chapter as adopted shall not conflict with but
shall be in addition to any prohibition of Article 18 of the General Municipal
Law or any other general or special law relating to ethical conduct and
interest in contracts of municipal officers and employees.
§ 17-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
CODE OF ETHICS  The provisions of this chapter.
INTEREST  A direct or indirect pecuniary or material benefit accruing to
a municipal officer or employee as the result of a contract with the Village.
A. The Village Board of the Village of Ossining recognizes that there are
state statutory provisions mandating municipalities to establish rules
and standards of ethical conduct for public officers and employees,
which, if observed, can enhance public confidence in local government.
In the light of a tendency today on the part of some people to
downgrade our local governments and to discredit our public servants
and our free institutions generally, it appears necessary that every
effort be made to assure the highest caliber of public administration of
this Village as part of our state's important system of local government.
It is the purpose of this chapter to implement this objective through the
establishment of clear standards of conduct, to provide for punishment
of any violation of such standards and to create a Board of Ethics to

member of the BOE shall not be a lawyer. Each member shall serve
without compensation for a term of three years from the date of

take his/her place shall be for a term of three years. If a vacancy on the
BOE occurs other than by the expiration of a member's term, the Village

term. Members whose terms have expired shall continue to serve as
members of the BOE until the member is reappointed, resigns or a new
member is appointed in place of the departing member. A member may

this determination shall be the date the Village Board of Trustees
appoints a member to the Board. The Chair shall assign requests for
advisory opinion and matters subject to investigation on a rotating
basis. The Chair must be an attorney.

calendar year.
D. Notwithstanding the foregoing attendance requirements, the failure of
a BOE member to attend the required percentage of meetings shall not
affect the member's ability to hear, deliberate and vote on matters
before the BOE or otherwise affect the validity of the member's actions.
No action of the BOE will be voided or declared invalid as a result of a
member's failure to comply with the annual attendance requirement.

regarding alleged violations by municipal officers and employees of the
code of ethics, the General Municipal Law or any other law relating
to the ethical conduct of municipal officers and employees. The Board

advisory opinions regarding such complaints. In addition, the BOE may
make recommendations with respect to the drafting and adoption of
a code of ethics or amendments thereto upon request of the Board of
Trustees.

alleging a violation of this chapter or upon determining on its own
initiative, acceptable by a majority of the Board, that a violation of the
chapter may exist, the Board of Ethics shall have the power and duty to
conduct any investigation necessary to carry out the provisions of this
chapter. In conducting any such investigation, the Board of Ethics may
administer oaths or affirmations. The Board may, with the concurrence
of a majority of the Board, compel attendance of witnesses, and require
the production of books or records that it may deem relevant and
material. The Board of Ethics shall make reasonable efforts to obtain
voluntary cooperation prior to exercising or enforcing its right to
compel testimony, or require the production of books and records.
Further, the Board of Ethics shall take steps to ensure that every
individual's right to due process is protected.

including but not limited to applicable provisions of NYS Civil Service Law
and NYS Public Officers Law, as specifically germane to elected officials.
§ 17-8. Severability.
The provisions of this chapter are separable and if any provision, clause,
sentence, subsection, word or part thereof is held illegal, invalid or
unconstitutional, or inapplicable to any person or circumstance, such
illegality, invalidity or unconstitutionality, or inapplicability shall not affect
or impair any of the remaining provisions, clauses, sentences, subsections,
words or parts of this chapter or their petition to other persons or
circumstances. It is hereby declared to be the legislative intent that this
chapter would have been adopted if such illegal, invalid or unconstitutional

§ 60-1. Purpose.
It is recognized that the buildings and establishments operated as adult
entertainment uses have serious objectionable operational characteristics.
In order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents
of the Village of Ossining, this chapter is intended to restrict adult
entertainment uses to a nonresidential area of the Village. The Board of
Trustees hereby finds that the operational characteristics of adult uses
increases the detrimental impact on a community when such uses are
spread throughout the community. The Board of Trustees finds that, based
upon common knowledge and experience and studies conducted by other
municipalities, the adult entertainment uses sought to be regulated by this
chapter have been associated with criminal and other socially undesirable
behavior, such as disorderly conduct, prostitution, pornography, drug
trafficking and substance abuse, which have the resulting effects of
depressing property values in the surrounding neighborhood and increasing
the burden upon law enforcement personnel and municipal expenditures
therefor. Therefore, this chapter is intended to promote the health, safety
and general welfare of the residents of the Village of Ossining by regulating
the concentration and location of such uses.

Requirements for Affordable Housing; General Provisions
§ 62-1. Purpose.
The Village of Ossining is deeply concerned that there are insufficient
opportunities for individuals and families of modest income to purchase or
rent dwelling units in the Village. In order to enhance the public welfare
and to promote the well-being of the Village's current and future residents,
the Board believes that it is essential that new or substantially rehabilitated
residential and mixed-use developments involving the construction or
substantial rehabilitation of six or more new dwelling units be required to
include 10% of the dwelling units aimed at individuals and families of 80%
or less of the Westchester County median income as determined by Housing
and Urban Development (HUD) annually in rental or purchase housing or,
in the alternative, be required to make payments to an affordable housing
fund to assist in the development of housing opportunities for individuals
and families of those economic means.
§ 62-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ADDITONAL DENSITY BONUS  The unit count of additional density
permitted in a residential development which shall equal 5% of the
maximum market rate unit count in such residential development deemed
appropriate by the Planning Board that proposes to include 10% low-income
housing units, for a total of 15% additional density.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING RULES AND REGULATIONS  Document
promulgated, adopted and as amended from time to time by the Village
Board that outlines the procedures of the Village of Ossining affordable
housing program.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS  Affordable units created pursuant to the
set-aside requirement of 10% shall be marketed to households which meet
the criteria of 80% or less of the Westchester County median income as
determined by HUD annually and whose combined annual rental cost and
tenant-paid utilities do not exceed 30% of said income, or for homeowners
(single-family, residential condominium or residential cooperative
apartment), the annual total of the sum of secured loan principal and
interest, private mortgage insurance, property taxes, home insurance,
common charges and homeowner-paid utilities does not exceed 30% of said
household income.
DENSITY BONUS  The unit count of additional density permitted in a
residential development, which shall equal 10% of the maximum market
rate unit count in such residential development which proposes to include
10% affordable housing units.
LOW INCOME  Annual household income which does not exceed 60% of
the Westchester County median income as determined by HUD annually
§ 62-1 CHARTER § 62-2
C:151
and whose combined annual rental cost and tenant-paid utilities do not
exceed 30% of said income, or for homeowners (single-family, residential
condominium or residential cooperative apartment), the annual total of the
sum of secured loan principal and interest, private mortgage insurance,
property taxes, home insurance, common charges and homeowner-paid
utilities does not exceed 30% of said household income.
MARKET RATE  Dwelling units in single-family, residential condominium
and residential cooperative apartment buildings which are purchased or
rented for residency by the owner thereof at market rate purchase prices,
without governmental or other subsidy to such owner.

100% of the Westchester County median annual income for its household
size (based on U.S. Census and as updated by HUD).
PURCHASE HOUSING  Dwelling units in single-family, residential
condominium and residential cooperative apartment buildings which are
purchased for residency by the owner thereof.
RENTAL HOUSING  Dwelling units in single-family, two-family,
multifamily, residential condominium and residential cooperative apartment
buildings which are rented for residency by the tenant thereof.
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT  A residential or mixed-use development
involving the construction of six or more new dwelling units, including
subdivisions.
RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT APPLICATION  An application for final
subdivision, site plan or special permit approval which proposes the
construction of six or more new dwelling units in the Village.
SUBSTANTIAL REHABILITATION  Any building that is reconstructed or
restored or structurally altered, the cost of same equals or exceeds 50% of
its assessed value.
§ 62-3. Inclusion of affordable dwelling units in rental housing
required.

construction or substantial rehabilitation of six or more dwelling units
of rental housing shall provide a set-aside of 10% affordable housing

D. In lieu of providing all or a part of on-site affordable housing units in the
rental housing as provided herein, the residential development
application may request and, upon a showing of an undue burden of
financial hardship to the project satisfactory to the Village, the Village
Board may permit a developer to create affordable housing units at
another location in the Village or contribute to the affordable housing
fund buyout fee. Amounts of such buyout fee and uses for same will be
as determined by the Village Board and shall be set forth in the
affordable housing rules and reguslations.
E. Density bonus and additional density bonus.
(1) Those residential developments that will contain affordable
housing units in the rental housing pursuant to this section shall
qualify for increased density, permitting the maximum unit count of
the rental housing in the residential development, as permitted
under its zoning district, to be adjusted as follows:
(a) For rental housing in which at least 10% of the market-rate
unit count, rounded up to the nearest whole number, is devoted
to affordable housing units, applicants may have a density
bonus of a unit count which equals the number of units of
affordable housing being proposed and agreed upon by the
Planning Board.
(b) For rental housing in which at least 10% of the unit count,

ARTICLE V
Tethering
[Added 10-3-2018 by L.L. No. 6-2018]
§ 75-29. Purpose.
The Board of Trustees finds that dogs left tied to an object outside for
prolonged periods of time may not have sufficient food, water or shelter
from inclement weather. The Board of Trustees further finds that tethers,
chains and other restraints can also injure animals, as the restraint may
tangle and catch on other objects. Recognizing that outdoor conditions
appropriate for one breed may not be appropriate for another breed, the
Board of Trustees also determines that it is in the best interest of Village
residents and their dogs to limit the amount of time the dogs spend outside
tied to a stationary object.
§ 75-30. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
RESPONSIBLE PARTY  Any person owning, harboring, or having custody

structure, including, without limitation, a house, tree, fence, post, garage,
or shed, by any means, including, without limitation, a chain, rope, cord,
leash, or running line. Tethering does not include the use of a leash to walk
a dog.
WEATHER ALERT  A warning issued by the National Weather Service for
heat advisory, frigid weather, snow or ice storm, tornados, tropical storm,
high winds or thunderstorms.
§ 75-31. Prohibited acts.
A. It shall be unlawful for any responsible party to tether, leash, fasten,
secure, restrain, chain or tie a dog to any stationary object outdoors or
cause such dog to be restrained in a manner that:
(1) Endangers such dog's health, safety or well-being;
(2) Restricts such dog's access to suitable and sufficient food and
water;
(3) Does not provide the dog with shelter appropriate to its breed,
physical condition, and the climate as defined by § 353-b of the
New York State Agriculture and Markets Law; or
(4) Unreasonably limits the movement of such dog because the tether
is too short for the dog to move around or for the dog to urinate or
defecate in a separate area from the area where it must eat, drink
and lie down.
§ 75-29 CHARTER § 75-31
C:189
B. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, no
responsible party shall tether, leash, fasten, secure, restrain, chain or
tie a dog to any object with a device that:

dog in such a manner that it impairs the flow of oxygen or blood to
the dog, which may cause choking or causes substantial discomfort
to the dog;

such dog's skin;

(6) Because of its design or placement, the tether is likely to become
entangled;
(7) Would allow the restrained dog to move over an object or edge that
could result in the strangulation of or injury to such dog.
C. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, no
responsible party shall tether, leash, fasten, secure, restrain, chain or
tie a dog to any stationary object outdoors if the dog is:
(1) Less than six months of age;
(2) Sick or injured; or
(3) A nursing mother whose offspring is present.
D. Multiple dogs shall not be tethered or restrained in such a manner that
the dogs are able to come in contact with one another at any point while
restrained.
E. Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection A of this section, a dog
may be tethered outside for a maximum of 12 hours in any twenty-fourhour
period, except that a dog may not be tethered outside when the

article shall, for a first offense, be guilty of a violation punishable by a
fine no more than $250 and/or an educational component at the court's

written warning instead of a fine for such first offense where the dog
was not injured as a result of being restrained in violation of this article.
C. A responsible party who is found to have violated the provisions of this
article a second time within a twelve-month period shall be guilty of a
violation punishable by a fine no more than $500 and/or 50 hours of
community service, plus reimbursement of investigation costs.
D. A responsible party who is found to have violated the provisions of this
article a third time within a continuous twelve-month period starting
from the first offense shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine

specific, identified portions of its response be treated as confidential
and withheld from public disclosure. The franchisee must state the
reasons why the information should be treated as proprietary and the

the provisions of the Freedom of Information Act, 5 U.S.C. § 552, FCC
Rate Regulations, and New York State law, where applicable. If the
franchisee requests confidentiality and the request is denied, where the
franchisee is proposing a rate increase, it may withdraw the proposal,

institutions by providing governmental, educational or health care
communications.

contained herein:

number of Village residents.

Village, will take control and operate the cable television system.
Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan for such
operation that will ensure continued service and compliance with all
franchise obligations during the term the financial institution exercises
control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise
control over the system for a period exceeding one year, unless
extended by the Village at its discretion, and during said period of time
it shall have the right to petition for transfer of the franchise to another
grantee. If the Village finds that such transfer, after considering the
legal, financial, character, technical and other public interest
qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the Village will transfer
and assign the rights and obligations of such franchise as in the public
interest. The consent of the Village to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably withheld.
E. The consent or approval of the Village to any transfer of the grantee
shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the Village in and
to the streets, and any transfer shall, by its terms, be expressly subject
to the terms and conditions of this Part 2 and the franchise.
F. In the absence of extraordinary circumstances, the Village will not
approve any transfer or assignment of the franchise prior to completion

C:239
§ 103-19. Franchise renewal discretionary.
Upon completion of the term of any franchise granted under this Part 2, the
Village may, in its sole discretion, grant or deny renewal of the franchise of
the grantee in accordance with the provisions of the Cable Act. The grantee
shall own the cable communication system, but shall have no property right
in the public rights of way upon the completion of the franchise term.
§ 103-20. Police powers.
information as is required in accordance with FCC regulations and by
the Village. If the Village fails to render a final decision on the request
within 120 days, such request shall be deemed granted unless the
requesting party and the Village agree to an extension of time. In the
event that the Village refuses to grant the aforementioned request, it
shall set forth specific reasons for its decision, in writing, by municipal
resolution.
H. In determining whether to approve said request, the Village may
consider the following:
(1) Experience of the proposed assignee or transferee (including
conducting an investigation of proposed assignee or transferee's
service record in other communities.
(2) Qualifications of proposed assignee or transferee.
(3) Legal integrity of proposed assignee or transferee.
(4) Financial ability and stability of the proposed assignee or
transferee.
(5) The ability and express commitment of the proposed assignee or
transferee to fully comply with the provisions of this agreement.
I. A copy of the completed sales agreement or a functionally equivalent
instrument between the grantee and the proposed transferee or
assignee shall be available to the Village for inspection at the grantee's
local office, upon request of the letter.
J. The Village may approve said petition contingent on compliance with
additional standards, terms or conditions within its legal authority and
consistent with findings resulting from its review of the aforementioned
petition.
A. In accepting the franchise, the grantee acknowledges that its rights
hereunder are subject to the police power of the Village to adopt and
enforce general local laws necessary to the safety and welfare of the
public; and it agrees to comply with all applicable general laws and
local laws enacted by the Village pursuant to such power.
B. Any conflict between the provisions of this Part 2 or the franchise and
any other present or future lawful exercise of the Village's police
§ 103-18 OSSINING CODE § 103-20
C:240
§ 103-21. Franchise fees.
powers shall be resolved in favor of the latter, except that any such
exercise that is not of general application in the jurisdiction or applies
exclusively to the grantee or cable communications systems which
contain provisions inconsistent with this Part 2 shall prevail only if,
upon such exercise, the Village finds an emergency exists constituting a
danger to health, safety, property or general welfare and such exercise
is mandated by law.
A. Because the Village finds that:
(1) The streets of the county, state and Village to be used by the
grantee in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the
franchise area are valuable public properties acquired and
maintained by the county, state and Village at great expense to its
taxpayers.
(2) The grant to the grantee to said streets is a valuable property right
without which the grantee would be required to invest substantial
capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions.
(3) The administration of this Part 2 and the franchise imposes upon
the Village additional regulatory responsibility and expense.
(4) A grantee of any franchise hereunder shall pay to the Village a
franchise fee in an amount as designated in the franchise, but in no
event less than 5% of the gross annual revenues or the maximum
amount permitted under applicable federal, state or local law, if
such maximum is greater than 5% less the annual assessment paid
by the grantee to the New York State Commission on Cable
Television. The annual franchise payment shall be in addition to any
other fee and shall commence as of the effective date of the
franchise. The Village shall be furnished a statement of said
payment by a certified public accountant reflecting the total
amounts of annual gross revenues and the above charges and
computations for the period covered by the payment.
B. Franchise fee in addition to other tax or payment. This payment shall be
in addition to any other tax or payment owed to the governments or
other taxing jurisdiction by the grantee.
C. Acceptance by the Village. No acceptance of any payment by the Village
shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any
claim the Village may have for further or additional sums payable as a
franchise fee under this Part 2 or for the performance of any other
obligation of the grantee.
D. Failure to make required payment. In the event that any franchise
payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates
specified herein, the grantee shall pay, as additional compensation, an
interest charge, computed from such due date, at the annual rate equal
§ 103-20 CHARTER § 103-21
C:241
§ 103-22. Forfeiture or revocation.
to the commercial prime interest rate of the Village primary depository
bank during the period that such unpaid amount is owed.
E. Payments to be made quarterly. The franchise fee and any other cost or
damage assessed against the grantee shall be payable quarterly to the
Village of Ossining. The grantee shall file a complete and accurate
verified statement of all gross revenues within the franchise area
during the period for which said quarterly payment is made, and said
payment shall be made to the Village no later than 45 days following the
end of each calendar quarter. Quarterly computation dates are the last
day in the months of March, June, September and December.
F. The Village's right of inspection. The Village shall have the right to
inspect the grantee's income records and the right to audit at its own
expense determined to be payable under this Part 2. However, in the
event that the audit concludes that the grantee's payments hereunder
were underpaid by an amount greater than 5% of the proper payment,
then the grantee shall reimburse the Village for the costs of said audit,
in addition to making any additional payments required to bring said
grantee into compliance with this section. At the sole discretion of the
Village, the latter may collect interest from the grantee on the
underpayment or any other late payment at a rate equal to the prime
rate, plus 3%.
A. Grounds for revocation. The Village reserves the right to revoke any
franchise granted hereunder and rescind all rights and privileges
associated with the franchise in the following circumstances, each of
which shall represent a default and breach under the local law and the
franchise grant:
(1) Defaulting in the performance of any of the material obligations
under this Part 2 or under such documents, contracts and other
terms and provisions entered into by and between the Village and
the grantee.
(2) Failure to provide or maintain in full force and effect the liability
and indemnification coverage or the performance bond as required
herein.
(3) Violating any lawful orders or rulings of any regulatory body having
jurisdiction over the grantee relative to this Part 2 or the franchise.
(4) Evading, as defined in state law, any of the provisions of this Part 2
or the franchise or practices any fraud or deceit upon the Village or
cable subscribers.
(5) Failure to meet the construction schedule contained in the
franchise or beyond any extended date set by the Village.
§ 103-21 OSSINING CODE § 103-22
C:242
(6) Failure to restore service after 96 consecutive hours of interrupted
service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from
the Village.
(7) Material misrepresentation of fact in the application for or
negotiation of the franchise or any extension or renewal thereof.
(8) Ceasing to provide all services for any reason within the control of
the grantee over the cable communications system.
B. Effect of circumstances beyond control of the grantee. The grantee
shall not be declared at fault or be subject to any sanction under any
provision of this Part 2 in any case, in which performance of any such
provision is prevented for reasons beyond the grantee's control. A fault
shall not be deemed to be beyond the grantee's control, if committed by
a corporation or other business entity in which the grantee holds a
controlling interest, whether held directly or indirectly.
C. Pending litigation or any appeal to any regulatory body or court having
jurisdiction over the grantee shall not excuse the grantee from the
performance of its obligations under this Part 2 or the franchise. Failure
of the grantee to perform such obligations because of pending litigation
or petition may result in forfeiture or revocation pursuant to the
provisions of this section.
D. Procedure prior to revocation.
(1) The Village shall make written demand that the grantee shall
comply with any such requirement, limitation, term condition, rule
or regulation or correct any action deemed cause for revocation. If
the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period
of 30 days following such written demand, the Village shall place its
request for termination of the franchise upon a regular Village
Board of Trustees meeting agenda. The Village shall cause to be
served upon such grantee, at least seven days prior to the date of
such Village Board of Trustees meeting, a written notice of this
intent to request such termination and the time and place of the
meeting, notice of which shall be published by the Village Clerk at
least once, seven days before such meeting in a newspaper of
general circulation within the Village.
(2) The Village Board of Trustees shall hear any persons interested
therein, and shall determine in its discretion, whether or not any
failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause.
(3) If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just
cause, as defined by the Village, the Village Board of Trustees shall
direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and
upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable.
(4) If the Village Board of Trustees shall determine such failure, refusal
or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the Village
§ 103-22 CHARTER § 103-22
C:243
Board of Trustees shall, by resolution, declare that the franchise
of the grantee shall be terminated and the performance bond
forfeited unless there is compliance by the grantee within a
specified period of time not to exceed 90 days or such longer period
as reasonably necessary to comply as approved by the Board of
Trustees, whose approval shall not be reasonably withheld.
E. Disposition of facilities. In the event that a franchise is not renewed
and/or revoked, the Village may, in its sole discretion, do any of the

this Part 2.
(2) Effect a transfer of ownership of the system to another party;
(3) Order the removal of the system facilities required by public
necessity from the Village within a reasonable period of time as
determined by the Village or require the original grantee to

convey its ownership or interest in the facilities constituting the
cable system to a successor grantee approved by the Village. Any
such facilities that are not so conveyed shall be considered to be
abandoned to the ownership and use of the Village, subject to the
right of the grantee to remove any such facilities or any portion of
such facilities that may be salvageable.
F. Restoration of property. In removing its plant, structures and
equipment, the grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation
that shall be made by it and shall leave all public ways and places in as
good a condition or better as that prevailing prior to the grantee's
removal of its equipment and appliances without affecting the electrical
or telephone cable wires or attachments. The Village shall inspect and
approve the condition of the public ways and public places and cables,
wires, attachments and poles after removal. The liability, indemnity,

full force and effect during the period of removal and until full
compliance by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this
subsection, this Part 2 and the franchise.
G. Restoration by Village; reimbursement of costs. In the event of a failure
by the grantee to complete any work required by §§ 103-10 and 103-12
and/or Subsection F above or any other work required by the Village
Law or local law within the time as may be established and to the
satisfaction of the Village, the Village may cause such work to be done
and the grantee shall reimburse the Village the cost thereof within 30
days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs or the Village may
recover such costs through the performance bond provided by grantee.

the Village, cease and terminate 120 days after the appointment of a
receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the
business of the grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization,
bankruptcy or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or
trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of said 120
days, or unless:
(1) Such receivers or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their
election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and

(2) Such receivers, or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute an
agreement duly approved by the Court having jurisdiction in the
premises, whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to

B. Termination by judicial action. In the case of a foreclosure or other
judicial sale of the plant, property and equipment of the grantee or any

restores service under conditions acceptable to the Village or a
permanent operator is selected. If the Village is required to fulfill this

After due consideration, it has been determined that the Village of
Ossining's Route 9 corridor, more specifically its associated business
districts, is the most conducive area for the location of licensed pawnbroker
businesses, as the parcels located along this corridor provide superior
parking and loading options as well as superior visibility, more so than other
areas of the Village. No pawnbroker business shall be permitted to operate
in any historic district, nor shall a pawnbroker business be permitted in
any zoning district of the Village of Ossining, except a PC Planned Center,
GB General Business, or NC-1 Neighborhood Center District. A pawnbroker

may prescribe in a written notice to be served upon such pawnbroker
by a sworn member of the Police Department on forms to be furnished/
approved by the Police Department, provide a description of all goods,
articles, or things, or the identity or proof of ownership of pledgors, such
as is required to be kept under § 110-8 of this chapter, which have been
pawned or pledged in the course of business of the pawnbroker during
the days specified in such notice and, if such notice from the Chief of

person pawning or pledging any goods, articles, or things a memorandum
or note signed by him/her containing his/her address and the substance
of the entry required to be made or received by any pawnbroker for any
such entry, memorandum, or note. The holder of such memorandum or note
shall be presumed to be the person entitled to redeem the pledge, and
the pawnbroker shall deliver such article to the person so presenting such
memorandum or note upon payment of principal or interest. Should such
memorandum or note be lost or mislaid, the pledgor shall at once apply to
the pawnbroker, in which case it shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to
permit such person to examine his/her records, and upon finding the entry
for such memorandum or note so lost and upon giving to the pawnbroker
an exact description of the article pawned, the pawnbroker shall issue a
second or stop ticket for the same. In case such pledgor neglects to so apply
and examine such records and receive such memorandum or note in the
manner above stated, the pawnbroker shall be bound to deliver the pledge
to any person producing such memorandum or note for redemption thereof.
This section is not to be construed as in any manner limiting or affecting
such pawnbroker's common-law viability in cases where goods are stolen or
other legal defects of title exist in the pledge.
§ 110-11. Sale of unclaimed pledge.
No licensed pawnbroker shall sell or otherwise dispose of any pawn or
pledge unless the interest shall be four months or more in arrears, and all
such sales of defaulted pledges shall be at public auction or by private sale
in absolute conformity with applicable laws, regulations and rules, including
but not limited to the provisions of the General Business Law pertaining to
public auctions and the Uniform Commercial Code provisions pertaining to
the disposal of collateral after default.

previous thereto in the official newspaper of the Village of Ossining, and
such notice shall specify the time and place at which such public sale is
to take place and a description of the goods or articles to be sold. Every
pawnbroker shall enter into records kept for that purpose a true account
of the sale of all goods sold by him/her at auction or otherwise, stating the
day of the month when pledged, the name of the person pledging, the day
when and the amount for which each pledge was sold and the name of the
auctioneer. Any person who shall have pledged any unredeemed goods, or
his/her assigns, administrators and executors, shall at reasonable times be
permitted to inspect such record of sale. Every pawnbroker shall give notice
of the expiration of the six months from the date of the loan after which a
public sale of the article pledged may take place, by letter directed to the
borrower at his/her last known residence at least 10 days and not more than
20 days after the expiration of such six months.
§ 110-13. Disposition of proceeds of sale.
§ 110-14. Maximum rate of interest; term of interest; storage
charge prohibited.
A. The surplus money, if any, arising from any such sale, after deducting
the amount of the loan, the interest then due on the same and the
expense of advertising and sale shall be paid over by the pawnbroker to
the person who would be entitled to redeem the pledge in case no such

determination of nonsignificance as provided in Subdivision 10(a) of
Part 617. For unlisted actions, the lead agency must send a
determination of nonsignificance to the applicant and maintain its own

commences from the date of the determination of environmental
nonsignificance is made, if the applicant prepared a draft EIS in lieu of
an EAF, the time of filing commences from the date the lead agency
accepts the draft EIS as adequate in scope and content and commences
from the public comment period.

determines that the proposed action may be environmentally
significant, then an EIS must be prepared.

§ 119-1. Legislative intent.
The preservation and improvement of the quality of the natural and manmade
environment within the Village of Ossining, in the face of population

future inhabitants and require forthright action by the governing body of
the Village of Ossining. It is recognized that the biological integrity of
the natural and functional beauty of our surroundings, which condition
the quality of our life experience, cannot be protected without the full
cooperation and participation of all the people in the Village of Ossining
working in partnership with local and state officials and with various public
and private institutions, agencies and organizations. Establishment of an
Environmental Advisory Council is a necessary step in fostering unified
action on environmental problems.

appointed by the Board of Trustees, who shall serve at the pleasure of
said Board. Persons residing within the Village of Ossining who are
interested in the improvement and preservation of environmental
quality shall be eligible for appointment as a member of the Council.
Vacancies on the Council shall be filled in the same manner as the
original appointment except that a vacancy occurring other than by the
expiration of term of office shall be filled only for the remainder of the
unexpired term.
B. Each member shall be appointed to a two-year term from the date of
appointment. Members whose terms have expired shall continue to
serve as members of the Council until the member is reappointed,
resigns or a new member is appointed in place of the departing
member. A member may be appointed to a maximum of four
consecutive terms (eight years). If the member has served for four
consecutive terms, that member must be off of the Council for one year
before applying for appointment to the Council.

location during all blasting and authorized to act on behalf of the
applicant for all administrative purposes.
(3) The name, address and telephone number of the person who will be
conducting the blasting, and a copy of the blaster's license to
purchase, own, possess, transport and use explosives and a
certificate of competence.
(4) An estimate of how much blasting is anticipated and the type and
amount of material to be ignited or discharged. Where more than
one blast is anticipated, the applicant shall estimate how many
separate blasts are expected and the approximate duration blasting
activity will continue.

showing all structures within a five-hundred-foot radius of the
proposed blast site, together with a description of each structure
within such radius. Any property owner subject to a preblast
property description shall be furnished a copy of the description of
his property upon request. The Building Inspector may, in his sole
discretion, require that the preblast survey be accompanied with a
videotape showing each building and structure and any particular
features as he may direct. The Building Inspector may, in his sole
discretion, waive all or any portion of the preblast survey
depending on the particular characteristics of the site, the
surrounding area and the type of blasting proposed. The applicant
shall, upon request, make a copy of the preblast survey available to
the Building Inspector. Where a preblast survey indicates electric
transmission lines within 500 feet of a proposed blast site, the
Building Inspector or his representative may require testing to
determine the presence and level of errant electrical current in the
area. If testing indicates the presence of errant electrical current in
the vicinity where explosives are to be detonated at a level
sufficient to pose a potential threat to public safety, the Building
Inspector may require that any blasting be conducted solely by use
of nonelectrical detonation.

The Building Inspector shall appear and state his findings and the
reasons for revoking or modifying the permit. The permit holder and/or
the blaster shall he offered the opportunity to appear and present
evidence why the permit should not be modified or revoked. The Appeal
Board may sustain the Building Inspector's decision to revoke a permit,
reinstate any permit or amend any modifications imposed by the
Building Inspector. Where the Board reinstates a permit, the Board may
amend the permit by adding whatever terms and conditions it deems
necessary to protect public health, safety and welfare. The decision of
the appeal panel shall be final.
A. No blast shall be initiated at any location within the Village limits unless
a written permit has first been obtained from Building Inspector
authorizing blasting at the specific location.
B. Blasting conducted within the Village must comply with the terms of the
permit and, in addition, all applicable state and federal heath and safety
standards.
C. At least five business days prior to the scheduled start of blasting, the
permit holder shall request a preblast meeting with the Building
Inspector to review and finalize the proposed blasting plan. No blasting
shall be conducted unless a preblast meeting has been held with the
Building Inspector and the Building Inspector is satisfied that the
proposed blasting plan is reasonable.
D. Each blasting permit holder shall establish and delineate a blast zone
prior to detonating a blast. The blast zone must be clearly marked, and
adequate precautions must be implemented to prevent unauthorized
entry into the area.
§ 123-7 OSSINING CODE § 123-8
C:314
E. Prior to each blast, the blaster or his designee shall be responsible for
notifying all persons in the general area that blasting operations are
scheduled to begin within a specified period of time. In addition, the
blaster shall sound a recognized whistle, siren or horn loud enough to
be heard throughout the designated blast zone approximately three
minutes prior to blasting and again 30 seconds prior to blasting,
warning all persons that blasting is imminent.
F. The Building Inspector or his representative shall be permitted access
to observe all aspects of the blasting operation, including but not
limited to observation of all preblast preparatory site work, the
explosion/detonation and access to the postblast site, The property
owner shall reimburse the Village for the cost of all inspection services,
including the cost of retaining an on-site inspector to monitor all
aspects of blasting, by depositing the estimated cost of inspection
services in a designated account to be held in escrow by the Village and
applied to reimburse the Village for costs incurred in administering
compliance with this chapter. The permit holder and the blaster shall,
upon request, make available to the Building Inspector a copy of all
seismic reading and any and all other documentation and data collected
regarding any blast.

in providing police, emergency services or any other personnel deemed
necessary to ensure public safety.
I. Notwithstanding any other regulations, no blasting shall be performed
in such manner or under such circumstances as to eject debris into the
air so as to constitute a hazard or danger or do harm or damage to
persons or property. Before firing a blast which could cause injury to
persons or damage property from fly rock, the material to be blasted
shall be properly covered or screened by a buffer of sufficient mass and
strength to prevent, with a margin of safety, the ejection of any material
capable of causing any injury or damage.
J. No person shall use a quantity of explosives greater than necessary to
break or move the target material or use an amount of explosives that
poses a risk of injury to persons or property.
K. Unless otherwise permitted by the Village Building Inspector, all holes
drilled or otherwise excavated for holding an explosive charge shall be
at least six feet deep. If, however, the permit holder/blaster can
demonstrate a need to use a hole less than six feet deep and that such a
cavity will not endanger public safety, the Village Building Inspector or
his designated representative may, in his discretion, authorize the use
of blast holes less than six feet deep.
§ 123-8 CHARTER § 123-8
C:315
L. The blaster shall plan each blast and take every precaution in loading,
delaying, initiation, confinement and stemming to control the throw of
rock fragments and debris and limit ground vibrations and the effect of
air concussions to the greatest extent possible. When blasting is to be
conducted within 50 feet or less of a property line and the adjacent
property owner is not a party to the blasting operation, the blaster shall
take all precautions practicable, utilizing any combination of
recognized methods, to control blasting effects to the greatest degree
possible.
M. A record of each blast shall be kept by the blaster on a form approved
by the Village Building Inspector. All such records shall be retained by
the permit holder and blaster as prescribed by state law and made
available for inspection as a matter of public record.

N. Where an accident involves personal injury, the permit holder shall
immediately notify the Building Inspector that an accident has
occurred, and no further blasting shall be conducted until the Building
Inspector has had an opportunity to review the accident report and the
permit. Any injury, accident or misfire involving explosives shall be
recorded, and a full written report shall be attached to the blast report
filed with the Building Inspector, including the names of all participants
and witnesses and remedial actions taken. The Building Inspector may
require such additional, specific information from the blaster as he
deems necessary and appropriate to assure the public health and safety.
Following an accident involving personal injury, the Building Inspector
may amend the permit by adding whatever additional restrictions are
deemed necessary to assure that public health and safety is maintained
and another similar accident does not reoccur.
A. The maximum allowable concussion or air blast resulting from blast
operations shall not exceed 130 decibels peak, measured at a flat
frequency response (-f- two decibels) over the range of at least six to
200 hertz.

Stream Maintenance
[Adopted 12-17-1974 by L.L. No. 6-1974]
§ 141-1. Title.
This article shall be cited and may be referred to hereinafter as the "Stream
Maintenance Law."
§ 141-2. Legislative findings of fact.
It is hereby found and determined by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Ossining that severe damage to person and property has been sustained by
residents of the Village of Ossining as a result of the flooding and overflow
of the natural streams and watercourses which traverse this Village. It is
further found and determined that a contributing cause to this flooding
has been the blockage of natural stream flow caused by improper or
inconsistent maintenance and debris removal by the owners of real property
abutting said streams. It is further found and determined that, concurrent
with the right to enjoy and use these natural resources of the Village by
some residents of the Village, it is the responsibility to maintain them free
of debris and blockage which adversely affect the health, safety and welfare
of other residents of the Village.
§ 141-3. Legislative intent.
It is the intention of the Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining in
adopting this article to preserve, protect and secure the public health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the Village of Ossining by exercising
the police and home rule powers of the Village of Ossining, New York.
§ 141-4. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall, for the
purpose of this article, have the following meanings.
NATURAL STREAM OR WATERCOURSE  A body of water flowing in a
defined bed or channel, with banks and sides, having permanent sources of
supply, uniform or interrupted.
§ 141-5. General provisions.
It shall be the duty and obligation of every owner of real property abutting
a natural stream or watercourse to keep and maintain, free and clear of
any and all debris, trash, rubbish and similar substances which, by their
nature, cause or tend to cause stoppage or blockage of natural stream flow,
that portion of the real property which constitutes the shore or bank of
the stream as well as that portion of the stream bed which abuts the real
property within straight lines drawn at right angles between the side lines
of the real property on the shore and the center line of the stream.
§ 141-1 CHARTER § 141-6
C:327
§ 141-6. Notice to remove debris.
Within 10 days after a notice to remove debris has been served upon an
owner of real property by the Building Inspector of the Village of Ossining
or his deputy, either personally or by certified mail with return receipt
addressed to the name of the owner as it appears on the assessment roll of
the Village, the owner shall comply with the provisions of the same to the
satisfaction of the Building Inspector or his deputy.
§ 141-7. Failure to comply with notice.
The failure to remove debris within 10 days after notice to do so has been
served as provided in § 141-6 shall be deemed a violation of this article.
§ 141-8. Effect of failure to comply.
If the provisions of this article are not complied with, and if the owner upon
whom notice is served pursuant to § 141-6 fails or neglects to remove such
debris within 10 days of the service thereof, the Building Inspector may
cause the debris to be removed.
§ 141-9. Lien; collection of costs. [Amended 8-3-1999 by L.L. No.
2-1999]
The actual costs of removal as provided for in § 141-8 hereof, plus an
additional charge set from time to time by resolution of the Village Board
of Trustees,51 for the cost of inspection and other costs incidental to such
removal shall be certified by the Building Inspector to the Village Clerk. The
Village Clerk shall thereupon notify the owner of such real property stating
that an expenditure has been made, its purpose and amount and that, at a
specified time and place, the Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining
will meet to make a determination of the amount of the expenditures. The
Board shall meet at the time and place specified in such notice. It shall
thereupon determine all objections that may be made to such assessment,
including the amount thereof and whether or not the object to be removed
was of such size or dimension that it would be an unnecessary hardship
upon the property owner to require said property owner to employ outside
labor to comply with the provisions hereof. The Board shall thereafter
assess upon the real property the amount which it deems fair and
reasonable, not exceeding in case of default, the amount stated in the
notice. The amount so determined shall thereupon become and be a lien
upon the real property and shall be added to and become a part of the taxes
next to be assessed and levied on such real property to be collected and
enforced in the same manner as taxes.

A. Findings. The Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining finds
that the potential and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may
be a problem to the residents of the Village of Ossining and that such
damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing,
damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and
injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set
forth, this article is adopted.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health,
safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses
due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters.
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages.

following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 141-14C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this article.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 141-15, Construction
standards, and in particular, Subsection A, Subdivision
proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant
to submit additional technical analyses and data necessary to
complete the determination. If the proposed development may
result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet
the requirements of § 141-15, Construction standards, no
permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the
adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.
(2) Use of other flood data.
(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced
water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the local
administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation and floodway data available from a
federal, state or other source, including data developed
pursuant to Subsection C(7), as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this article.
(b) When base flood elevation data is not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the
purposes of this article.

(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data is available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation in relation to mean sea level. The
certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by the same. For manufactured homes, the permit
holder shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement
of the structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also
be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site
for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed
and ready for highway use).
(b) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies
detected shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the
project unless immediately corrected.
(5) Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's
engineer or architect shall make periodic inspections at
appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order to
monitor compliance with permit conditions and enable said
inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development
permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The local administrator shall issue or cause to be issued a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing
without a development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order
shall subject the violator to the penalties described in
§ 141-13E of this article.

this article.
(7) Certificate of compliance.
(a) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 141-13B, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to
permit the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or
both, or part thereof hereafter created, erected, changed,
converted or wholly or partly altered or enlarged in its use or
structure until a certificate of compliance has been issued by
the local administrator stating that the building or land
conforms to the requirements of this article.
(b) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development
in areas of special flood hazard.
(c) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in § 141-14D(5), Inspections, and/or
any certified elevations, hydraulic data, floodproofing,
anchoring requirements or encroachment analyses which may

in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in Subsection A(4)(a) through (l) have been fully considered.
As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(a) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(b) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.

are met.
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damages during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.
(4) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
§ 141-16 OSSINING CODE § 141-16
C:350
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on
or victimization of the public; or conflict with existing chapters
or ordinances.
(7) Notification.
(a) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:
[1] The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and
[2] Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.
(b) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all
variance actions as required in § 141-14D(8) of this article.

Graffiti
§ 155-2. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining hereby finds and declares
that graffiti creates a nuisance for the Village's residents and merchants.
The proliferation of graffiti is a physical blight upon the landscape of the
Village and costs taxpayers, merchants and homeowners substantial monies
to remove and repair. When unchecked, graffiti only encourages more
graffiti.
§ 155-3. Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following words shall have the meaning
ascribed to them herein:
GRAFFITI  Shall have the same meaning as that found in § 145.60 of the
New York State Penal Law.

statue, monument, wall, tunnel, sign, structure, tree, utility box, utility pole,
waste receptacle and all other articles of personal or real property upon
which one can write, draw, paint, etch or otherwise mark.
§ 155-4. Prohibited acts.
It is unlawful for any person to apply graffiti to any property without the
permission of the owner or occupant of such property.
§ 155-5. Removal of graffiti; costs.
A. Requirement to remove graffiti. The occupant, owner, lessee, sublessee,
agent and/or landlord of any commercial, personal or residential
property located within the Village of Ossining on which any form of
graffiti has been written, painted, drawn, etched, or otherwise applied
shall remove the graffiti from public view by either moving the property,
removing the graffiti, or repainting, restoring, or recovering the surface
on which the graffiti has been applied using the same colors and
textures as existed previously on the surface, within seven days after
written notice from the Village. The Village may serve said written
notice on the occupant, owner, lessee, sublessee, agent and/or landlord
by personal service, in which case the seven-day curative period shall
begin to run from the date of said service, or by certified mail, return
receipt requested, to the address at which the property is located, in
which case the seven-day curative period shall run from the date that
said notice is received as set forth in that receipt or, if that receipt is not
returned, 14 days from the date of mailing.
B. Remedy of Village. If any graffiti is not removed from public view within
seven days after notice from the Village as set forth in § 155-5A, then
the Village may issue a criminal summons or appearance ticket
§ 155-2 CHARTER § 155-5
C:363
returnable in the Justice Court of the Town of Ossining, and may enter
the premises or hire a private contractor to enter the premises and
remove the graffiti from public view as set forth in § 155-5A, at the
cost and expense of the occupant, owner, lessee, sublessee, agent and/
or landlord of property. The actual cost of that removal, plus the cost
of the inspection of said property and other costs incidental to such
removal, shall become a lien upon any real property upon which the
graffiti was found and shall be added to and become a part of the taxes
next to be assessed and levied on such real property, and the same shall
be collected and enforced in the same manner as general Village taxes.

Title; Applicability; Construal
§ 162-5. Title. [Amended 4-19-2017 by L.L. No. 3-2017]
This chapter shall be known as the "Housing/Property Maintenance and
Building Enforcement Code of the Village of Ossining."
§ 162-6. Legislative finding of fact.
It is hereby found and declared that there exists in the Village of Ossining,
structures used for human habitation which are or may become in the
future, substandard with respect to structure, equipment or maintenance
and that such conditions, together with inadequate provisions for light
and air, insufficient protection against fire hazards, lack of proper heating,
unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, constitute a menace to the health,
safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of its citizens, the
establishment and maintenance of minimum housing and property
standards are essential to the prevention of blight and decay and the
safeguarding of public health, safety, morals and welfare.
§ 162-7. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety and
welfare in buildings and on the premises as hereinafter provided by:
§ 162-8. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all structures and premises
which are now or may become in the future substandard with respect
to: structure, premises, protection against fire hazard, equipment or
maintenance, inadequate provisions for light and air, lack of proper heating,
insanitary conditions, overcrowding or other conditions which may be
deemed to constitute a menace to the safety, health or welfare of their
occupants. The existence of such conditions, factors or characteristics
adversely affects public safety, health and welfare and leads to the
continuation, extension and aggravation of urban blight. Adequate
protection of the public, therefore, requires the establishment and
enforcement of these minimum standards.

existing on the effective date of this chapter, the provisions which establish
the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the safety and
health of the people shall prevail.

§ 162-40. Enforcement.
A. Orders to remedy.
(1) Code Enforcement personnel are authorized to order, in writing,
the remedying of any condition or activity found to exist in, on or
about any building, structure, or premises in violation of the
Uniform Code, the Energy Code, and/or the Village Code, where
applicable. An order to remedy shall be in writing; shall be dated
and signed by Code Enforcement personnel; shall specify the
condition or activity that violates the Uniform Code, the Energy
Code, and/or the Village of Ossining Code; shall specify the
provisions or provisions of the Uniform Code, the Energy Code,
and/or the Village of Ossining Code which is/are violated by the
specified condition or activity; and shall include a statement
substantially similar to the following:
"The person or entity served with this order to remedy must
completely remedy each violation described in this order to
remedy by [specify date], which is 30 days after the date of this
order to remedy."
(2) Code Enforcement personnel may include in the order to remedy
provisions ordering the person or entity served with such order to
remedy to begin to remedy the violations described in the order to
remedy immediately, or within some other specified period of time
which may be less than 30 days; to continue diligently to remedy
such violations until each such violation is fully remedied; and, in
any event, to complete the remedying of all such violations within
30 days of the date of such order to remedy; and/or to take such
other protective actions (such as vacating the building or
barricading the area where the violations exist) which are
authorized by this chapter or by any other applicable statute,
regulation, rule, local law or ordinance, and which Code
Enforcement personnel may deem appropriate, during the period
while such violations are being remedied. Code Enforcement
personnel shall cause the order to remedy, or a copy thereof, to be
served on the owner of the affected property personally or by
registered mail or certified mail within five days after the date of
the order to remedy. If the order to remedy is served personally by
any authorized means that requires more than one action by the
person effecting service [such as service by "delivery and mail"
similar to that authorized by Civil Practice Law and Rules § 308(2)],
the order to remedy shall be deemed to be served on the date on
which the last required action is taken. Where the order to remedy
is served by registered or certified mail, it shall be deemed served
on the date the order is mailed. Service of the order to remedy also
may be effected using the manner of service detailed in § 162-31.
Code Enforcement personnel shall be permitted, but not required,
to cause the order to remedy, or a copy thereof, to be served on any
§ 162-40 CHARTER § 162-40

superintendent, or their agents, or any other person taking part
or assisting in work being performed at the affected property
personally or by registered mail or certified mail within five days
after the date of the order to remedy; provided, however, that
failure to serve any person mentioned in this sentence shall not
affect the efficacy of the order.
B. Other means of enforcing the Uniform Code. Nothing in this section
shall be construed as requiring Code Enforcement personnel to issue an
order to remedy in a given situation where violations of the Uniform
Code, Energy Code and/or Village Code, where applicable, are found to
exist if, in the judgment of Code Enforcement personnel, such violations
can be addressed adequately by the use of other enforcement tools or
by other means. Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting
the authority the Village to employ any other means of enforcing the
Uniform Code and/or Energy Code and/or Village Code, where
applicable, including, but not limited to:
(1) Issuing notices of violation;
(2) Issuing appearance tickets;

fire protection equipment and systems, shall be subject to a fine of
not more than $1,000 per day of violation, or imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or both;
(4) Commencing and prosecuting an appropriate action or proceeding
pursuant to Subdivision 3 of § 382 of the Executive Law which
seeks, in a case where the construction or use of a building is in
violation of any provision of the Uniform Code or any lawful order
obtained thereunder, an order from a Justice of the Supreme Court
directing the removal of the building or an abatement of the
condition in violation of such provisions;
(5) Issuing stop-work orders;
(6) Revoking or suspending building permits, operating permits and/or
certificates of occupancy pursuant to the procedures established in
the code enforcement program of the authority having jurisdiction
or pursuant to any other applicable statute, regulation, rule, local
law or ordinance;
§ 162-40 OSSINING CODE § 162-40
C:410
(7) Commencing and prosecuting an appropriate action or proceeding
to impose such criminal and/or civil sanctions as may be provided
in any applicable statute, regulation, rule, local law or ordinance;
(8) Condemning and/or placarding a building in accordance with the
applicable provisions of the Uniform Code;
(9) Taking any action authorized by the procedures for identifying and
addressing unsafe structures and equipment as established in the

Code or the Village Code, or any term or condition of any building
permit, certificate of occupancy, temporary or partial certificate, stopwork
order, operating permit or other notice or order issued by Code
Enforcement personnel pursuant to any provision of this chapter shall
be liable to a civil penalty of not more than $200 for each day or part
thereof during which such violation continues. The civil penalties
provided by this Subsection shall be recoverable in an action instituted
in the name of the Village.
D. Injunctive relief. An action or proceeding may be instituted in the name
of the Village, in a court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent, restrain,
enjoin, correct, or abate any violation of, or to enforce, any provision of
the Uniform Code, the Energy Code, this chapter, or any term or
condition of any building permit, certificate of occupancy, temporary or
partial certificate, stop-work order, operating permit, order to remedy,
or other notice or order issued by Code Enforcement personnel
pursuant to any provision of this chapter. In particular, but not by way
of limitation, where the construction or use of a building or structure is
in violation of any provision of the Uniform Code, the Energy Code, the
Village Code, or any stop-work order, order to remedy or other order
obtained under the Uniform Code, the Energy Code or the Village Code,
an action or proceeding may be commenced in the name of the Village,
in the Supreme Court or in any other court having the requisite
jurisdiction, to obtain an order directing the removal of the building or
structure or an abatement of the condition in violation of such
provisions. No action or proceeding described in this subsection shall
be commenced without the appropriate authorization from the Board of
Trustees.

Appeals or by a court of record on application, on notice to Code
Enforcement personnel from whom the appeal is taken and on due

ARTICLE VII
Commercial Occupancy
[Added 9-17-2018 by L.L. No. 5-2018]
§ 162-47. Legislative findings; purpose.
The Village of Ossining seeks to encourage new businesses to come to the
Village and prosper. To accomplish this goal, the Board of Trustees believes
it is important that these new businesses obtain necessary information from
the Building Department about code requirements. This article institutes
a new change in commercial occupant permit, whereby the new business
owner and the Village, through its Building Department, can communicate
to ensure that the business operates in compliance with both state and local
codes.
§ 162-48. Permit required for change in commercial occupancy.
Prior to occupying any commercial space within any building in the Village
of Ossining, a change in commercial occupant permit must be applied for
and approved by the Building Department. If you are proposing a new store
or business within the Village of Ossining, whether it involves a purchase or
lease of a storefront, commercial space, or portion of an existing building,
plans may be required to be presented to the Building Department for
the utilization of such commercial space/building. Plans may be required
even if there are no proposed alterations or renovations. A permit and plan
may be necessary so that Building Department personnel can confirm that
the proposed business is permitted under the Zoning Code and that the
intended use of the space/building complies with the New York State Fire
Prevention and Building Code (Uniform Code), the New York State Energy
Construction Conservation Code (Energy Code) and the Village of Ossining
Code.
§ 162-49. Application for permit.
A. The application for a building permit, and its accompanying documents,
shall contain sufficient information to permit a determination that the
intended work is in accord with the requirements of the Uniform Code,
Energy Code and the Village Code.
B. The form of the permit and application therefor shall be prescribed by
the Director of Code Enforcement, Building Inspector or his/her
designee. The application shall be signed by the owner of the building
or his authorized agent, the owner of the new business and shall
contain at least the following:
(1) Full name and address of the owner and, if by a corporation, the
name and addresses of the officers; if by a partnership, the names
and addresses of the partners; if by a limited-liability company, the
name and address of the managing member;
§ 162-47 CHARTER § 162-49
C:417
§ 162-50. Review of proposed change by Director of Code
Enforcement or Building Inspector.
If the Director of Code Enforcement, Building Inspector and/or Assistant
Building Inspector finds after reviewing the proposed changes in
commercial space that the proposed changes do not substantially conform
to the requirements of the Village Code, Chapter 270, he/she shall refer the
application to the Planning Department for referral to the Planning Board
and/or Zoning Board of Appeals.
§ 162-51. Penalties for offenses.
The penalty for commencing work without obtaining the required change in
commercial occupant permit shall be $1,000 or three times the cost of the
permit, whichever is greater.
(2) Identification and/or description of the land on which the work is to
be done;
(3) Description of use or occupancy of the land and existing or
proposed building (legal survey);
(4) Description of the proposed work;
(5) Two sets of plans and specifications for the proposed work; and
(6) The required fee.
C. The Director of Code Enforcement, Building Inspector and/or Assistant
Building Inspector may waive the requirement for plans and
specifications when the work to be done involves minor alterations.
D. The applicant shall notify the Director of Code Enforcement, Building
Inspector and/or Assistant Building Inspector of any changes in the
information contained in the application during the period for which the
permit is in effect. A permit will be issued when the application has
been determined to be complete and when the proposed work has been
determined to conform to the requirements of the Uniform Code,
Energy Code and Village Code. The authority conferred by such permit
may be limited by conditions, if any, contained therein. Amendments, if
any, to the application or to the plans and specifications accompanying
the same shall be filed with the Building Department prior to the
commencement of such change of work.

ARTICLE VIII
Vacant Building Registry
[Added 9-17-2018 by L.L. No. 5-2018]
§ 162-52. Legislative findings; purpose.
It is the finding of the Board of Trustees that buildings which remain
vacant, with access points boarded over, are unsightly, unsafe and have
a negative effect on their surroundings. This is particularly troublesome
in all neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many buildings, once boarded, remain
that way for many years. The purpose behind this article is to establish a
program for identifying and registering vacant buildings; to determine the
responsibilities of owners of vacant buildings and structures; and to speed
the rehabilitation of the vacant properties.
§ 162-53. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall, for the
purpose of this article, have the meanings indicated:
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  A duly authorized representative of the
Building Department, the Police Department, and Department of Public
Works.
HABITABLE  A building or space that meets or exceeds the New York
State minimum requirements for human occupancy.
OWNER  Those shown to be the owner or owners on the records of the
Village of Ossining, Department of Finance, those identified as the owner or
owners on a vacant building registration form, a mortgagee in possession,
a mortgagor in possession, assignee of rents, receiver, executor, trustee,
lessee, other person, firm or corporation in control of the premises. Any
such person shall have a joint and several obligation for compliance with
the provisions of this section.
PERFORMANCE GUARANTY  A bond, letter of credit, cash escrow or
other acceptable form of guaranty, as determined by the Village Treasurer,
to cover the Village's potential cost of correcting code violations or abating
unsafe or imminently dangerous conditions. The sufficiency of such
performance guaranty shall be determined by the Village Treasurer after
consultation with the Corporation Counsel and other officials and
departments of the Village of Ossining as appropriate.
SECURED BY OTHER THAN NORMAL MEANS  A building secured by
means other than those used in the design of the building.
UNOCCUPIED  A building which is vacant or is not legally being used for
an occupancy authorized by the owner.
UNSECURED  A building or portion of a building which is open,
accessible or an attractive nuisance.
VACANT BUILDING  Any building, structure or portion thereof designed
or used for residential or commercial purposes which has been unoccupied
§ 162-52 CHARTER § 162-53
C:419
or unused for a period of 60 days or longer. Additionally, a vacant building
will include any building, structure or portion thereof that is unoccupied as
determined by the appropriate village, county or state agency.
§ 162-54. Vacant building registration; fees.
A. The owner shall register with the Building Department not later than 30
days after any building located in the Village becomes a vacant building
or not later than 30 days after being notified by the Building
Department to register. The Enforcement Officer may identify vacant
buildings through its routine inspection process, as well as through
notification by residents, neighborhood associations and other
community groups, that a building may be eligible for inclusion on the
registry. The owner shall register the property annually with the
Building Department. The renewal date shall be January 31 of each
year.

Department and shall include, among other matters, the following
information supplied by the owner:

(4) The names, addresses and phone numbers of all known lien holders
and all other parties holding an ownership interest in the property;
and
(5) A telephone number where a responsible person and owner can be
reached at all times.
C. The owners shall submit a vacant building plan which must meet the
approval of the Director of Code Enforcement, the Building Inspector or
Assistant Building Inspector. The plan, at a minimum, must contain
information from one of the following three choices for the property:
(1) If the building is to be demolished, a demolition plan under a
permit application filed with the Building Department, indicating
the proposed time frame for the building to be demolished, an

C:420
building will be vacant, and a performance guaranty, all of which
must be acceptable to the Director of Code Enforcement, Building
Inspector or Assistant Building Inspector.
(3) If the building is to be returned to appropriate occupancy or use, a
rehabilitation plan for the property and a performance guaranty
shall be provided. The rehabilitation plan shall not exceed 365
days, unless the Director of Code Enforcement, Building Inspector
or Assistant Building Inspector grants an extension upon receipt of

correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the Village's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization, or causes or contributes to pollutants to be discharged or
deposited into the Village's MS4.
A. Best management practices. Where the Village Engineer has identified
illicit discharges as defined in § 164-2 of this chapter or activities
contaminating stormwater as defined in § 164-7 of this chapter, the
Village Engineer may require implementation of best management
practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials, pollutants or other
wastes into the MS4 through the use of structural and
nonstructural BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 164-2 of this
chapter or an activity contaminating stormwater as defined in
§ 164-9 of this chapter may be investigated by the Village to see if
they are responsible.
(3) Any person responsible for a property or premises which is the
source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 164-2 of this chapter or
an activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 164-9 of this
chapter may be required to implement, at said person's expense,
additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or
eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(4) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed in compliance
with the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems: response to special conditions
requiring no increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of
pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the Village's MS4 being subject to the special conditions
as defined in § 164-2 of this chapter, the owner or operator of such
individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
§ 164-9 OSSINING CODE § 164-10
C:442
§ 164-11. Suspension of access to MS4.
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as
follows:
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge
accumulation and maintain records of such inspection. Septic
tanks must be pumped out whenever the bottom of the scum
layer is within three inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or
sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is within 10 inches of the
bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary tee.
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents,
kitchen wastes, laundry wastes and household chemicals; and
(d) Avoid the disposal of cigarette butts, disposable diapers,
sanitary napkins, trash and other such items.
(2) Repair or replace individual sewage treatment systems as follows:
(a) In accordance with 10 NYCRR, Appendix 75-A to the maximum
extent practicable.

A. The Village Engineer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge
access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual
or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The Village Engineer shall notify the person of
such suspension within a reasonable time thereafter in writing of the
reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the Village Engineer may
take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to
the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons at the owner's expense.
§ 164-10 CHARTER § 164-11
C:443
§ 164-12. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Village Engineer prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 164-13. Connection permits.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge or unauthorized
connection. Any person discharging to the Village's MS4 in violation of
this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination
would abate or reduce an illicit discharge or result in the remedy of an
unauthorized connection. The Building Department will notify a violator
in writing of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the
reasons therefor. The violator may petition the Building Department for
a reconsideration or appeal their case to the Zoning Board of Appeals.
Access may be granted by the Village Engineer if he/she finds that the
illicit discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to
prevent its recurrence, or that the discharger has obtained proper
permission for the connection. Access may be denied if the Village
Engineer determines in writing that the illicit discharge has not ceased
or is likely to recur or the unauthorized connection has not been
remedied. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4
access to premises terminated pursuant to this section without the
prior approval of the Village Engineer.
A. General. Any connection to the Village's MS4 requires a permit issued
by the Village Engineer. Applications for permits shall be made on
forms provided by the Office of the Village Engineer. Permit
applications shall be supplemented by any plans, specifications,
analyses, calculations or other information considered pertinent by the
Village Engineer. The Village considers connection to its MS4 as a last
resort to solve flooding problems. Before approving a connection, the
Village will require that applicants use on-site best management
practices to handle stormwater and other authorized nonstormwater
discharges to the maximum extent practicable. The Office of the Village
Engineer will assess the adequacy of the applicant's on-site stormwater
disposal management practices.
B. Permit types.
(1) General permit. An authorization for the connection as well as the
discharge of stormwater or authorized nonstormwater (per
§ 164-6A(1) of this chapter) from properties occupied by private
dwellings.
(2) Connection permit. An authorization for connection as well as
discharge authorized under § 164-13 of this chapter, as well as for a
discharge permitted under a SPDES permit, waiver, or waste
§ 164-11 OSSINING CODE § 164-13
C:444
discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under
the authority of the NYSDEC. This permit is subject to special
terms and conditions by the Village Engineer. The permit will
expire on or before the expiration of the NYSDEC SPDES permit,
waiver or order or upon change of ownership or use of the property.
(3) Special permit. An authorization for the connection as well as the
discharge of stormwater or authorized nonstormwater (per
§ 164-6A(1) of this chapter), from all properties occupied by other
than private dwellings.
C. Permit fees. There shall be a permit application fee and inspection fee
in amounts as set forth in a fee schedule established from time to time
by resolution of the Village Board.
D. Inspection. All connections to the Village's MS4 shall be subject to the
approval and inspection by the Village or Village's designated
professional consultant and at the owner's expense. The applicant must
notify the Office of the Village Engineer at least 48 hours prior to
commencing work and at least 48 hours prior to final restoration.
E. Indemnification. The property owner shall indemnify and save the
Village harmless from any loss, damage or expense, claims or suits
arising out of and in connection with the installation and connection to
the Village's MS4. In addition, the Village makes no guarantee that its
MS4 will not become surcharged or otherwise overburdened and that
water from the MS4 will not back up through the connection onto the
owner's property. By making a connection, the applicant/owner
assumes all of the risk and liability that may arise from it.
F. Permit transfers. General permits may be transferred with the sale of a
residential property, provided the use does not change. The new
property owner shall comply with the terms and conditions of the
transferred permit. Special permits are not transferable without
approval of the Village Engineer.
G. Work within Village roads. Any connection made within or involving
work within a Village road will also comply and be subject to any and all
applicable chapters and regulations pertaining to permits for work on
and within Village streets and roads. A permit under this chapter does
not relieve the applicant from the permits under the foregoing chapters
and regulations.
H. Other permits required. A connection permit issued pursuant to this
chapter does not relieve the applicant from any and all other permits,
permissions, or compliance with rules and regulations that may be
required by federal, state, county, town, city, Village government
agencies or other public or private parties. This permit does not
supersede any of the above.

§ 164-14. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
I. Permit rules and regulations. The Village Engineer may promulgate
rules and regulations for the permitting process within the constraints
of this chapter.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the Village
Engineer must inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or
whenever the authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that
there exists, or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition
that constitutes a violation of this chapter.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities public
and private subject to regulation under this chapter as often as may
be necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. If a
discharger has security measures in force that require proper
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
chapter.
(3) The Village shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to
this chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
Village Engineer to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The Village Engineer has the right to require the facilities subject
to this chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this chapter. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) The Village shall have access to a facility within 15 days of
notification and access not granted within 15 days subject to this
chapter is a violation of this chapter. A person who is the operator
of a facility subject to this chapter commits an offense if the person
denies the Village reasonable access to the facility for the purpose
of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
§ 164-13 OSSINING CODE § 164-14
C:446
§ 164-15. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Village Engineer in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the Village Engineer within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 164-16. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. The enforcement agency will enforce the provisions of this chapter.
Where the Village Engineer has identified an unauthorized connection
as defined in § 164-2 of this chapter, the enforcement agency in
cooperation with a recommendation from the Village Engineer, may
require that a proper permit be obtained or that the connection be
removed at the property owner's expense.
B. Notice of violation. When the Village Engineer finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter or
a permit issued pursuant to this chapter, the Building Department may
order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible
person. In addition, the Building Department is hereby authorized to
issue appearance tickets as such term is defined in the Criminal
Procedure Law of the State of New York. A notice of violation may

§ 204-1. Intent.
The Village of Ossining has determined that the health, safety and welfare
of the citizens of the Village of Ossining are promoted by requiring certain
structures to have a key lock box installed on the exterior of the structure
to aid the Ossining Fire Department in gaining access to the structure
when responding to calls for emergency service. The key lock box system
will eliminate forced entries into structures, thereby avoiding costly and
time-consuming efforts in gaining access to locked structures during an
emergency. Many properties are equipped with automatic alarm systems
and/or sprinkler/standpipe systems, and these automatic systems may cause
the Ossining Fire Department to be summoned at a time when the building
or business is not occupied or when the occupant is not available to provide
entry for the Fire Department. The Village of Ossining is authorized to
promulgate this and other local laws in furtherance of the health, safety and
welfare of its citizens pursuant to its police power and its home rule power.

immediate access to the property is necessary for life-saving and fire-
§ 201-21 OSSINING CODE § 204-2
C:510
fighting purposes, it shall be equipped with a security padlock, to
be installed in a location approved by the Code Enforcement Official.
In lieu of a key lock box, an optional system approved by the Code
Enforcement Official may be implemented.
D. When a construction site is to be secured by a locked fence or gate, that
site will fall under Subsection C above during the duration of the
construction or until said fence or gate is removed.
E. This chapter shall not apply to those structures where an on-site police
force is present 24 hours per day, seven days a week, provided
members of that police force respond to all Fire Department responses
with the correct means of accessing the affected structures.
F. All newly constructed structures subject to this chapter shall have the
key lock box installed and operational prior to the issuance of a
certificate of occupancy by the Code Enforcement Official. All
structures in existence on the effective date of this chapter, subject to
this chapter shall have six months from the effective date of this chapter
to have a key lock box installed and operational.
G. The Code Enforcement Official shall designate the type of key lock box
system to be implemented within the Village of Ossining and shall have
the authority to require all structures to use the designated system.
H. The owner or operator of a structure required to have a key lock box
shall, at all times, keep the following in the lock box:

I. Floor plans of the common areas within the building may also be
required to be submitted to the Code Enforcement Official.
J. The Code Enforcement Official shall be authorized to implement rules
and regulations for the use of the lock box system.
§ 204-2 CHARTER § 204-3
C:511
§ 204-3. Fire Department connection security caps required.
When a building is protected by an automatic sprinkler system or standpipe
system and the Fire Department connection is exposed to undue vandalism,
the Code Enforcement Official may require that a Fire Department
connection security cap(s) be installed. The Fire Department connection
security cap(s) shall be a type approved by the Code Enforcement Official.
Existing sprinkler installations will require approved locking Fire
Department connection caps to be installed when directed by the Code
Enforcement Official.

§ 227-1. Findings of fact.
It has been determined by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation (NYSDEC) that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the state;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.

§ 227-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within the Village
and to address the state's findings of fact in § 227-1 hereof. This chapter
seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
§ 227-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State
of New York, the Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining has the
authority to enact local laws and amend local laws and for the purpose of
promoting the health, safety or general welfare of the Village of Ossining
and for the protection and enhancement of its physical environment. The
Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining may include in any such local
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse

medium-density or in apartment-type developments), the Board may
require reservation and/or dedication in compliance with § 7-730 of the
Village Law of land for the suitable development of a park or parks for
playgrounds or recreational purposes. The Board shall not require that
more than 15% of the gross area of the subdivision be so dedicated or
reserved. The minimum area of contiguous open space for dedication
shall not be less than two acres. Open spaces of less area may be
accepted whenever the Board deems it advisable to accept such land in
lieu of the following provision. [Amended 8-3-1999 by L.L. No.

location of the subdivision or for other reasons, land for parks,
playgrounds or other recreation purposes cannot be properly located
therein or is not otherwise practicable to require the same as a
condition of approval, the Board shall waive the requirement that such
land be reserved and/or dedicated, provided that a cash payment in lieu
thereof for each dwelling unit, of a sum set from time to time by

§ 241-1. Tax on utilities authorized and levied.
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 5-530 of the Village Law of the
State of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from June 1,
1950, is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the Village
of Ossining which is subject to the supervision of the State Department of
Public Service, which has a gross income for 12 months ending May 31 in
excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers subject to such supervision
under § 240 et seq. of the Transportation Law, and a tax equal to 1% of its
gross operating income is hereby imposed for the same period upon every
other utility doing business in the Village of Ossining which has a gross
operating income for 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500, which
taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the Village
of Ossining, and shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees
imposed by any other provision of law for the same period. Such taxes shall
not be imposed on any transaction originating or consummated outside of
the territorial limits of the Village of Ossining, notwithstanding that some
act be necessarily performed with respect to such transaction within such
limits.
§ 241-2. Definitions. [Amended 8-3-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
Words and phrases in this article shall be the same as those words and
phrases defined in § 186-A, Subdivisions 2, 2-a and 2-b, of the Tax Law.
§ 241-3. Records.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its
business and in such form as the Treasurer may require, and such records
shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the Treasurer may
consent to their destruction within that period or may require that they be
kept longer.
§ 241-4. Quarterly returns. [Amended 8-3-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
The filing of quarterly returns shall conform to provisions of § 186-a,
Subdivision 4, of the Tax Law.
§ 241-5. When tax payment is due.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the Treasurer the tax imposed by this article for the period covered
by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of filing the
return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which the
return is required to be filed.
§ 241-1 CHARTER § 241-6
C:649
§ 241-6. Determination of tax upon inadequate returns or when no
return is filed.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient return is not
filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice from the Treasurer,
or if no return is made for any period, the Treasurer shall determine the
amount of tax due from such information as he or she is able to obtain,
and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices
or otherwise. The Treasurer shall give notice of such determination to the
person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and irrevocably
fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30
days after the giving of notice of such determination, apply to the Treasurer
for a hearing or unless the Treasurer of his or her own motion shall reduce
the same. After such hearing, the Treasurer shall give notice of his or her
decision to the person liable for the tax. The decision of the Treasurer
may be reviewed by certiorari if application therefor is made within 30
days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order of certiorari shall
not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed, with
penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited with the Treasurer and
an undertaking filed with him in such amount and with such sureties as a
Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such order
be dismissed or the tax confirmed, the applicant for the order will pay all
costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of the certiorari
proceeding or, at the option of the applicant, such undertaking may be in
a sum sufficient to cover the tax, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid,
in which event the applicant shall not be required to pay such tax and
penalties as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
§ 241-7. Notices.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article, or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 241-8. Penalty for failure to file return or pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof, within the time required by this article, shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Treasurer, if
satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of such
penalty.
§ 241-6 OSSINING CODE § 241-9
C:650
§ 241-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof, and the Treasurer or the
court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was
erroneously or illegally collected, the Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so
made on the initiative of the Treasurer. However, no refund shall be made
of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer as
hereinbefore provided, unless the Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore
provided, or of his or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or
penalty or it shall have been established in a certiorari proceeding that such
determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of
moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund, made as
hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of
any tax or penalty complained of, and the Treasurer may receive additional
evidence with respect thereto. After making his or her determination, the
Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and he or she
shall be entitled to a certiorari order to review such determination, subject
to the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such an
order.
§ 241-10. Not to be billed separately to customers.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others, but shall constitute a part of the operating
costs of such utility.
§ 241-11. Collection.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
article, the Corporation Counsel shall, upon the request of the Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer. Each
such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person liable to
pay the same in the same manner and to the same extent that the tax, and
penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 241-12. Powers and duties of Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Treasurer shall have power to make
such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law, as may
be necessary for the exercise of his or her powers and the performance
of his or her duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other
records relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take
testimony and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within
the line of his or her official duty under this article and to subpoena and
require the attendance of witnesses and the production of books, papers
and documents.

C:651
§ 241-13. Confidentiality of returns.
A. Except in accordance with the proper judicial order or as otherwise
provided by law, it shall be unlawful for the Treasurer, or any agent,
clerk or employee of the Village of Ossining to divulge or make known
in any manner the amount of gross income or gross operating income or
any particulars set forth or disclosed in any return under this article.
The officer charged with the custody of such returns shall not be
required to produce any of them or evidence of anything contained in

this article or on behalf of the State Tax Commission in an action or
proceeding under the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of New
York, or on behalf of any party to any action or proceeding under the
provisions of this article when the returns or facts shown thereby are
directly involved in such action or proceeding, in either of which events
the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so
much of said returns or of the facts shown thereby, as are pertinent to
the action or proceeding, and no more. Nothing herein shall be
construed to prohibit the delivery to a person, or his or her duly
authorized representative, of a copy of any return filed by him, nor to
prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent the
identification of particular returns and the items thereof, or the
publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have
failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for by
this article, together with any relevant information which, in the
opinion of the Treasurer, may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes; or the inspection by the Corporation Counsel or other legal
representatives of the Village of Ossining of the return of any person
who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based thereon, or
against whom an action has been instituted in accordance with the
provisions of this article.
B. Any offense against the foregoing secrecy provisions shall be
punishable as provided in of Chapter 1, General Provisions, Article III,
General Penalty; and if the offender be an officer, agent, clerk or
employee of the Village of Ossining, he or she shall be dismissed from
office, and shall be incapable of holding any office or employment in the
Village of Ossining for a period of five years thereafter. [Amended
8-3-1999 by L.L. No. 2-1999]
C. Notwithstanding any provisions of this article, the Treasurer may
exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any other city or first class
village in the State of New York, information contained in returns filed
under this article, provided that such other city or village grants similar
privileges to the Village of Ossining, and provided that such information
is to be used for tax purposes only, and the Treasurer shall, upon
request, furnish the State Tax Commission with any information
contained in such returns.

hereafter imposed under this article shall be credited and deposited by him

ARTICLE II
Veterans' Exemption
[Adopted 2-26-1985 by L.L. No. 1-1985]
§ 241-15. Exemptions, title to real property, adjustments and
eligible funds.
A. Exemption applicable to veterans residing in cooperative apartments.
As set forth pursuant to § 458, Subdivision 8, of the New York State Real
Property Tax Law, title to that portion of real property owned by a
cooperative apartment corporation in which a tenant-stockholder
resides and which is represented by his or her share or shares of stock
in such corporation determined by its or their proportional relationship
to the total outstanding stock of the corporation, including that owned
by the corporation, shall be deemed to be vested in such tenantstockholder.
That proportion of the assessment of such real property
owned by a cooperative apartment corporation determined by the
relationship of such real property vested in such tenant-stockholder to
such real property owned by such cooperative apartment corporation in
which such tenant-stockholder resides shall be subject to exemption
from taxation pursuant to § 458 of the New York State Real Property Tax
Law and any exemption so granted shall be credited by the taxing
authority of the Village of Ossining against the assessed valuation of
such real property; the reduction in real property taxes realized thereby
shall be credited by the cooperative apartment corporation against the
amount of such taxes otherwise payable by or chargeable to such
tenant-stockholder. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a tenantstockholder
who resides in a dwelling that is subject to the provisions of
Articles 2, 4, 5 or 11 of the New York State Private Housing Finance
Law shall not be eligible for an exemption pursuant to this article.
B. Veterans exemption adjustment. As set forth in § 458(5) of the New York
State Real Property Tax Law, notwithstanding the limitation on the
amount of exemption prescribed in Subdivision 1 or 2 of § 458, if the
total assessed value of the real property for which such exemption has
been granted increases or decreases as the result of a revaluation or
update of assessments, and a material change in level of assessment, is
certified for the assessment roll pursuant to the rules of the
commissioner, the assessor shall increase or decrease the amount of
such exemption by multiplying the amount of such exemption by the
change in level of assessment factor. If the assessor receives the
certification after the completion, verification and filing of the final
assessment roll, the assessor shall certify the amount of exemption as
recomputed pursuant to this subsection and shall thereupon be
authorized to enter the recomputed exemption certified by the assessor
on the roll.
C. Recompute exemptions. For change in level of assessment rolls filed on
or after the date of adoption of this section, if additional eligible funds
are received and applied to the purchase of the property (for example,
§ 241-15 CHARTER § 241-15
C:655
by reducing the principal of a mortgage or making improvements to the
property), the existing veteran's exemption would be adjusted to reflect
the additional eligible funds multiplied by the change in level in the
year of the reassessment.
D. Transferred prorated exemption. As set forth in § 458(9) of the New
York State Real Property Tax Law, where a veteran, the spouse of the
veteran or unremarried surviving spouse already receiving an
exemption pursuant to § 458 of the New York State Real Property Tax
Law sells the property receiving the exemption and purchases property
within the same county, the assessor shall transfer and prorate, for the
remainder of the fiscal year, the exemption which the veteran, the
spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse received. The
prorated exemption shall be based upon the date the veteran, the
spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse obtains title to
the new property and shall be calculated by multiplying the tax rate or
rates for each municipal corporation which levied taxes, or for which
taxes were levied, on the appropriate tax roll used for the fiscal year or
years during which the transfer occurred times the previously granted
exempt amount times the fraction of each fiscal year or years remaining
subsequent to the transfer of title. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to remove the requirement that any such veteran, the spouse
of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse transferring an
exemption pursuant to Subdivision 9 of § 458 of the New York State
Real Property Tax Law shall reapply for the exemption authorized
pursuant to § 458 of the New York State Real Property Tax Law on or
before the following taxable status date, in the event such veteran, the
spouse of the veteran or unremarried surviving spouse wishes to
receive the exemption in future fiscal years.
E. Application for exemptions under New York State Real Property Tax
Law.
(1) Application for the exemption described in Subdivision 1 of New
York State Real Property Tax Law § 458 shall be made on a verified
form prescribed or approved by the State Board of Real Property
Services. Such application shall be filed in the office of the Assessor
of the Town of Ossining by or on behalf of the owner on or before
the taxable status date and shall state the amount of eligible funds,
as that term is defined in Real Property Tax Law § 458, used in the
purchase of the property.
(2) Application for the exemption described in Subdivision 2 of New
York State Real Property Tax Law § 458 shall be made on verified
form prescribed or approved by the State Board of Real Property
Services. Such application shall be filed in the office of the Assessor
of the Town of Ossining by or on behalf of the owner on or before
the taxable status date and shall state the facts upon which the
exemption is claimed as well as the amount of money raised by
popular subscription, as that term is defined in Real Property Tax
Law § 458, used in the purchase of the property.
§ 241-15 OSSINING CODE § 241-15
C:656
(3) Application for the exemption described in Subdivision 3 of New
York State Real Property Tax Law § 458 shall be made on a verified
form prescribed or approved by the State Board of Real Property
Services. Such application shall be filed in the office of the Assessor
of the Town of Ossining by or on behalf of the owner on or before
the taxable status date.
F. No alternative exemption available. No alternate exemption from real
property taxes shall be granted to veterans pursuant to Real Property
Tax Law, § 458-a with respect to real property taxes levied for the
Village of Ossining.

determines that there was a material misstatement in an application
filed by a head of household for a second tax abatement certificate
pursuant to this section and that such misstatement provided the basis
for the granting of such second certificate, the rent control agency or
administrative agency shall proceed to impose a penalty on the
applicant of $1,000, in addition to recovering the amount of any prior

ARTICLE I
Temporary Moratorium on Construction
[Adopted 2-19-1997 by L.L. No. 1-1997; amended in its entirety
9-16-1997 by L.L. No. 3-1997]
§ 246-1. Purpose.
§ 246-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ACCESSORY USE  An accessory use serves the principal use, is
subordinate in area, extent or purpose to the principal use, and is located
on the same lot as the principal use. Examples of such uses include
transmission equipment and storage sheds.
TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWER  A structure, including one or more
antennas, that is intended for transmitting and/or receiving radio,
television, telephone, or microwave communications but excluding those
A. The Federal Telecommunications Act (the "Act") was signed into law in
February of 1996. The Act preserves the authority of local governments
over reasonable nondiscriminatory decisions regarding the placement,
construction, and modification of telecommunication towers. The
passage of the Act, the increased sale of airwaves rights and issuance of
licenses by the FCC, the increased demand for wireless communication
services, and new technology have lead to a significant increase in the
demand for telecommunications towers within the state. The Village of
Ossining expects to receive requests to locate such towers and
accessory uses within the Village of Ossining and currently has no local
laws regarding the construction, installation, operation or location of
such towers and accessory uses within the Village.
B. The Village of Ossining has significant concerns over the location of
telecommunications towers within the Village. The Village would like to
insure that the installation of these towers proceeds in a fashion that
minimizes any adverse impacts while maximizing services and benefits
to the community. The Village wants to accommodate the need for
telecommunications towers while regulating their location and number,
minimize adverse visual effects through proper design, siting and
screening, avoid potential physical damage to adjacent properties, and
encourage joint use of tower structures.
C. This article is necessary in order to address the concerns of the Village
of Ossining by prohibiting the filing of new applications for tower
construction and thus defer official governmental action permitting the
construction of towers to give the Board of Trustees time to research
the issues and adopt a local law regulating telecommunications towers
and accessory uses consistent with the comprehensive plan of the
Village.
§ 246-1 CHARTER § 246-2
C:693
used either for fire, police and other dispatch communications, or
exclusively for private radio and television reception and private citizens
bands, amateur radio and other similar private, residential communications.
§ 246-3. Imposition of moratorium.
A. Until March 27, 1998, no application for the construction or erection of
a telecommunications tower or accessory use may be filed, accepted or
processed. For the purpose of this article, an application for tower
construction shall be deemed to mean any request for official action by
the Board of Trustees or other boards which request and approval
would in any way commence or continue the process whereby a
telecommunications tower or accessory use may be constructed or
erected. [Amended 12-16-1997 by Ord. No. 4-1997]
B. The imposition of this article shall not affect the processing of
applications for tower construction for which approval has been
granted prior to the effective date of this article or for existing towers.

C:694
ARTICLE II
General Regulations
[Adopted 9-1-1998 by L.L. No. 1-1998]
§ 246-4. Purpose and legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the Village of Ossining's
authority concerning the placement, construction and modification of
wireless telecommunications facilities. The Village Board of the Village
of Ossining finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose a
unique hazard to the health, safety, public welfare and environment of
the Village of Ossining and its inhabitants. The Village also recognizes
that facilitating the development of wireless service technology can be
an economic development asset to the Village and of significant benefit
to the Village and its residents. In order to insure that the placement,
construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is
consistent with the town's land use policies, the Village is adopting a
single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application
and permit process. The intent of this article is to minimize the negative
impact of wireless telecommunications facilities, establish a fair and
efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an
integrated, comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such
facilities, and protect the health, safety and welfare of the Village of
Ossining.
§ 246-5. Title.
This article may be known and cited as the "Wireless Telecommunications
Facilities Siting and Special Use Permit Law for the Village of Ossining."
§ 246-6. Severability.
A. If any word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other
portion of this article or any application thereof to any person or
circumstance is declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid for any
reason, then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or
other portion, or the prescribed application thereof, shall be severable,
and the remaining provisions of this article, and all applications thereof,
not having been declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall remain
in full force and effect.
B. Any special use permit issued under this article shall be comprehensive
and not severable. If part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be invalid or
unenforceable in any material respect, by a competent authority, or is
overturned by a competent authority, the permit shall be void in total,
upon election by the Village Board.

electromagnetic interference.
X. Unless waived by the Board, there shall be a preapplication meeting.
The purpose of the preapplication meeting will be to address issues
which will help to expedite the review and permitting process. Where
the application is for the shared use of an existing telecommunications
tower(s) or other high structure, the applicant should seek to waive any
section or subsection of this article that may not be required. At the
preapplication meeting, (this may include a site visit if required) the
waiver requests, if appropriate, will be decided by the Board and its
consultants. Costs of the town's consultants to prepare for and attend
the preapplication meeting will be borne by the applicant.
A. Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site
and erect said wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance
§ 246-9 OSSINING CODE § 246-10

with the following priorities, (1) being the highest priority and (4) being
the lowest priority.
(1) On existing telecommunications towers or other tall structures.
(2) Collocation on a site with existing wireless telecommunications
facilities or structures.
(3) On municipally-owned properties.
(4) On other property in the Village.
(a) If the proposed property site is not the highest priority listed
above, then a detailed explanation must be provided as to why
a site of a higher priority was not selected. The person seeking
such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason
or reasons why such a permit should be granted for the
proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
(b) An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating
the site presented is the only site leased or selected. An
application shall address collocation as an option, and, if such
option is not proposed, the applicant must explain why
collocation is commercially or otherwise impracticable.
Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting
collocation, shall not be a valid basis for any claim of
commercial impracticability or hardship.
(c) Notwithstanding the above, the Board may approve any site
located within an area in the above list of priorities, provided
that the Board finds that the proposed site is in the best
interest of the health, safety and welfare of the Village and its
inhabitants.
B. The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the
applicant's review of the above locations in order of priority,
demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If the site
selected is not the highest priority, then a detailed written explanation
as to why sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included
with the application.
C. The applicant shall, in writing, identify and disclose the number and
locations of any additional sites that the applicant has been, is, or will
be considering, reviewing or planning for wireless telecommunications
facilities in the Village, and all municipalities adjoining the Village, for a

§ 248-1. Legislative intent.
There is a direct relationship between the number of trees planted in a
community and the health, safety and welfare of that community. Trees
provide shade, add color, control water and air pollution, stabilize the soil,
prevent erosion and flooding, reduce air pollution, temper noise and add
aesthetic and historic values. Indiscriminate or unnecessary destruction of
trees causes deprivation of these benefits. Furthermore, the destruction
of trees causes increased municipal costs for proper drainage control and
impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing residential properties. In order
to provide protection against the indiscriminate destruction of trees, this
document establishes minimum standards for tree protection.
§ 248-2. Statutory authority.
The Village of Ossining, furthermore, takes note of the findings of the New
York State Environmental Quality Review Act,102 among them being the
obligation of the Village to serve as a steward of air, water, land and living
resources and the obligation to protect the environment for the use of this
and future generations. It is the intent of the Village to recognize these
responsibilities in part by providing these procedures as well as to preserve
the health and welfare and character of the community.

lot size, rounded up to the nearest whole number within any twelve-month
period.
CROWN  All portions of a tree, excluding the trunk and roots, such as

A. Authority of Village Manager
(1) Duty to declare emergency.
(a) It shall be the duty of the Village Manager or his or her
designee (hereinafter Village Manager) to declare a snow
emergency. Such condition will exist whenever he finds that
falling snow, sleet or freezing rain will create a condition which
makes it necessary that the standing of motor vehicles on snow
emergency streets be prohibited; or, whenever he finds, on the
basis of a firm forecast of snow, sleet or freezing rain, that the
weather conditions as so forecast may create a condition
making it necessary that such standing be prohibited, he is
authorized to announce such prohibition, to become effective
at a time specified by the Village Manager, but not less than
one hour after such announcement. Announcement of such
prohibition shall be in accordance with the requirements of
Subsection A(2) hereof . After the effective time of such
prohibition, no person shall stand any vehicle or permit any
vehicle to remain standing on a snow emergency street, except
that if a fall of snow, sleet or freezing rain occurs after 11:00
p.m. and prior to 6:00 a.m. and the Village Manager has not
announced prior to 11:00 p.m. that standing on snow
emergency streets is to be prohibited after a specified time, a
vehicle parked on a snow emergency street may remain so
parked until 7:00 a.m. first following such fall.
§ 250-28 CHARTER § 250-28.1
C:737
(b) The prohibition of standing announced by the Village Manager
under the authority of this subsection shall remain in effect
until the Village Manager announces the termination of the
snow emergency, in part or in whole, after which the
prohibition of standing authorized by this section shall no
longer be in effect.
(2) Each snow emergency parking regulation announcement by the
Village Manager shall be made between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and
11:00 p.m. by means of broadcasts or telecasts from not less than
two radio or television stations with a normal operating range
covering the Village of Ossining and, if possible, shall also be made
through newspapers of general circulation. Each such
announcement shall state the time these snow emergency parking
regulations become effective.
(3) Whenever the Village Manager shall find that some or all of the
conditions which gave rise to the snow emergency prohibition no
longer exist, he is authorized to declare the termination of the
emergency, in part or in whole, effective immediately upon
announcement, except that if such announcement is made other
than between 6:00 a.m. and 11:00 p.m., it shall be repeated
between those hours.
(4) The Village Manager shall make or cause to be made a record of
the date and time when the announcement of a snow emergency
parking regulation is first made to the public in accordance with
the requirements of Subsection A(2) and the date, time and
conditions of any announcements made to the public of the
termination of each snow emergency packing regulation, either in
part or in whole, in accordance with the requirements of this
section.
B. Between November 15 and April 1 of the following year, no person
operating a motor vehicle on a snow emergency street on which there is
a covering of snow, sleet or ice shall allow such vehicle to become
stalled, wholly or partly, because the drive wheels thereof are not
equipped with effective tire chains or snow tires. No person operating a
motor vehicle on a part of a snow emergency street on which there is a
covering of snow, sleet or ice or on which there is a parking prohibition
in effect shall park or allow such vehicle to become stalled because the
motor fuel supply is exhausted or the battery has become inoperative.
C. Whenever a vehicle becomes stalled for any reason, whether or not in
violation of this section, on any part of a snow emergency street on
which there is a covering of snow, sleet or ice or on which there is a
parking prohibition in effect, the person operating such vehicle shall
take immediate action to have the vehicle towed or pushed off the
roadway of such snow emergency street, either onto the first cross
street which is not a snow emergency street or onto the public space
portion of a nearby driveway. No person shall abandon or leave this
§ 250-28.1 OSSINING CODE § 250-28.1
C:738
§ 250-29. Overnight parking.
vehicle in the roadway of a snow emergency route (regardless of
whether he indicates, by raising the hood or otherwise, that the vehicle
is stalled), except for the purpose of securing assistance during the
actual time necessary to go to a nearby telephone or to a nearby
garage, gasoline station or other place of assistance and return without
delay.
D. Signs to mark snow emergency streets.
(1) On each street designated by this section as a snow emergency
street, there shall be posted, at intervals not exceeding 100 feet,
signs with the following wording:
NO PARKING DURING SNOW EMERGENCY
TOW-AWAY ZONE
(2) These signs shall be distinctive and uniform in appearance and
shall be plainly readable to persons traveling on the street or
highway and may be made of either wood, metal or cardboard.
E. Members of the Police Department are hereby authorized to remove or
have removed a vehicle from a street to the nearest garage or other
place of safety, including another place on a street, or to a garage or
parking lot designated or maintained by the Police Department or
otherwise maintained or designated by the Village when the vehicle is
stalled or otherwise stopped in contravention of this section on a snow
emergency street on which there is a parking prohibition in effect, and
the person who was operating such vehicle does not appear to be
removing it in accordance with the provisions of this Section, all as
more fully provided in Article IV, entitled "Removal and Storage," of
Chapter 250, entitled "Vehicles and Traffic," of the Village Code.
A. Legislative findings.
(1) The Board of Trustees of the Village of Ossining hereby finds and
determines that the overnight on-street parking of motor vehicles
within the Village is a hindrance to the governmental operations of
the Village in connection with the performance of its duties,
responsibilities and obligations to clean and sweep the streets and
remove snow, ice and debris therefrom; to locate and identify
stolen or abandoned vehicles; to prevent long-term storage of
vehicles on the public streets; and to enforce its zoning laws. While
recognizing that many residences and other buildings located in
the Village are old and were constructed without providing
adequate off-street parking facilities to accommodate the users of
such property, the Board of Trustees further finds and determines
that it is the primary responsibility of the owner of real property to
provide adequate off-street parking facilities for users of the
premises.
§ 250-28.1 CHARTER § 250-29
C:739
(2) After lengthy study and investigation, the Board of Trustees further
finds and determines that a complete and absolute prohibition of all
overnight parking on the streets within the Village would work an
extreme hardship on those owners and/or operators of motor
vehicles having a need to be at or use premises in the Village where
off-street parking facilities are inadequate or unavailable. The
Board of Trustees further finds that a partial prohibition of
overnight parking on the streets within the Village between the
hours of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. which contains an exemption in
certain instances where strict enforcement of such prohibition
would be an extreme hardship on the owner or operator of a motor
vehicle having a need to be at or use premises in the Village
between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. will allow the Village
to perform its governmental functions and provide just relief for
owners and operators of motor vehicles for whom off-street parking
facilities are inadequate or unavailable.
B. On-street parking prohibited between 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. The
parking of motor vehicles is hereby prohibited on all streets or
highways within the Village between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00
a.m., except as hereinafter provided.
C. On-street parking streets designated. The Board of Trustees shall
designate by resolution certain streets within the Village of Ossining
where owners or operators who have been granted a hardship
exemption from the strict enforcement of the provisions of this section
may park their vehicles between the hours of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m.
Such resolution may provide for parking on one side, both sides or on
alternate sides of a designated street. Such streets shall be signed and
posted as required by law. In accordance with this subsection,
overnight parking by owners or operators who have been granted a
hardship exemption from the strict enforcement of the provisions of this
section is permitted at the locations described in Schedule XXV
(§ 250-62), attached to and made a part of this chapter.
D. Hardship exemptions granted.
(1) Any person who, being the owner or operator of a motor vehicle,
has a need to park within the Village of Ossining between the hours
of 3:00 a.m. and 6:00 a.m. at a property location where facilities for
parking of his or her vehicle on the property are nonexistent or
inadequate and for whom the strict enforcement of the provision of
this section would constitute an extreme hardship, as hereafter
defined, may apply to the Village for a hardship exemption from the
strict enforcement of the provisions of this law.
(2) Such application shall be made upon forms provided by the Village

§ 250-29 OSSINING CODE § 250-29
C:740

address. The procedure for processing and determining such
applications and issuing any exemptions shall be determined by the
Board of Trustees.

is no area on the premises where a driveway or parking area can be

immediate access to the public highways and no such access exists
on the premises.

driver's license or vehicle registration or the cancellation of insurance
for the vehicle. [Amended 10-21-2003 by L.L. No. 8-2003104]

§ 262-1. Title.
This chapter will be known as the "Village of Ossining Waterfront
Consistency Review Law."
§ 262-2. Authority and purpose.
A. This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Waterfront Revitalization and Coastal Resources Act of the
State of New York (Article 42 of the Executive Law).
B. The purpose of this chapter is to:
(1) Implement consistency review regulations and procedures for the
Village of Ossining's Local Waterfront Revitalization Program
(LWRP).
(2) Provide agencies of the Village of Ossining with a framework to
consider the policies and purposes contained in the LWRP when
reviewing private applications for actions or direct agency actions
located within the LWRP boundaries which extend from Route 9
west to the middle of the Hudson River.
(3) Assure that proposed private and direct actions are consistent with
said policies and purposes of the LWRP.
C. It is the intention of the Village of Ossining that the preservation,
enhancement and utilization of the natural and man-made resources of
the unique coastal area of the Village take place in a coordinated and
comprehensive manner to ensure a proper balance between natural
resources and the need to accommodate population growth and
economic development. Accordingly, this chapter is intended to achieve
such a balance, permitting the beneficial use of coastal resources while
preventing loss of living coastal resources; diminution of open space
areas or public access to the waterfront; erosion of shoreline;
impairment of scenic beauty; losses due to flooding, erosion and
sedimentation; or permanent adverse changes to ecological systems.

(5) Other local agencies shall refer actions to be reviewed for LWRP
consistency, along with coastal assessment forms, to the Board of
Trustees.
B. Commencement of review. The consistency review process shall
commence as follows:
(1) When a private applicant is seeking Village approval or funding for
an action, the applicant shall prepare a CAF and submit it, along
with any other material relevant to the action (applications,
environmental assessment forms and other information necessary
to the review) to the Board of Trustees, Planning Board, Zoning
Board of Appeals or other local agency, as appropriate; or
(2) When the Board of Trustees, Planning Board or Zoning Board of

agency action) involves a local agency other than the Board of
Trustees, Planning Board or Zoning Board of Appeals, that agency
shall submit a CAF, along with other relevant material, to the Board
of Trustees. For actions requiring Village approval or funding, the
CAF will have been prepared by a private applicant (see Subsection
B(1) above); for actions to be directly undertaken by the local
agency, that agency will prepare the CAF.
C. Referral of the coastal assessment form. The Board of Trustees,
Planning Board or Zoning Board of Appeals shall refer a copy of the
completed CAF to the Village Manager and the Environmental Advisory
Council within 10 days of its submission to or completion by the
responsible board. The Board shall also forward any completed
applications, EAFs and any other information necessary to the
consistency review.
D. Review by the Environmental Advisory Council. After receiving the CAF
from the responsible board, the Council shall consider whether the
proposed action is consistent with the LWRP policy standards and
conditions set forth in § 262-7 herein. It shall base its determination on
all completed applications, the CAF and other information it deems to
be necessary to its consistency review.
E. Council recommendations.

C:831
(1) The Council shall render its written recommendation to the
responsible board within 30 days following referral of the CAF from
the responsible board, unless extended by mutual agreement of the
Council and the Board. The recommendation shall indicate
whether, in the opinion of the Council, the proposed action is
consistent with or inconsistent with one or more of the LWRP policy
standards or conditions and shall elaborate, in writing, the basis for
its opinion.
(2) The Council shall, along with its consistency recommendation,
make any suggestions concerning modification of the proposed
action to make it consistent with LWRP policy standards and
conditions or to greater advance them.
(3) In the event that the Council's recommendation is not forthcoming
within the specified time, the responsible board shall make its
decision without the benefit of the Council's recommendation.

Board or the Zoning Board of Appeals shall make a determination of
consistency following its next regularly scheduled meeting after
receiving the Council's recommendation, or, if no recommendation is
forthcoming, the date of the conclusion of the thirty-day review period.
The responsible board shall make and issue its determination of
consistency based on the CAF, the Council's recommendation and such
other information as is deemed to be necessary in its determination.

conditions or inconsistent. If determined to be consistent with
conditions, these conditions must be practicable and reasonable
measures for carrying out the action in accordance with the policy
standards and conditions of this chapter. If determined not to be
consistent with one or more of the LWRP policy standards and
conditions, the action shall not be undertaken unless the
responsible board makes a written finding with respect to the
proposed action that:
(a) No reasonable alternatives exist which would permit the action
to be undertaken in a manner which will not substantially
hinder the achievement of such LWRP policy standards and
conditions;

minimize all adverse effects on such LWRP policy standards
and conditions;

minimum, the applicant would have to achieve LEED Silver
certification or similar standard. An applicant pursuing a
similar standard would have to demonstrate that the green
building technologies being incorporated into the project are
of similar or greater efficiency in water and energy usage and
produce a carbon footprint that is similar or smaller than the
LEED Gold certification.

amenity offered, provided that the Planning Board finds that the
amenity is proportional to such density bonus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such bonus(es) shall not exceed the maximum number of
dwelling units specified in Appendix B.147
(3) The bonus permitted under this subsection is a bonus in
permissible density only and does not authorize deviation from or
enlargement of any bulk or lot coverage restrictions.

the degree to which the proposed amenity is compatible with
the goals and objectives for the zoning district and the Village

(b) Set forth, in detail, the amenities to be provided by the

171. Editor's Note: Appendix A, Use Tables, is included at the end of this chapter.
172. Editor's Note: Appendix C, Parking Requirements, is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 270-19 OSSINING CODE § 270-19
C:882
features. In order to help preserve and conserve these features, the
following lands shall be deducted from the developable land area
for the purposes of determining whether a development proposal
complies with coverage, lot area and density requirements:
Wetlands shall be deducted in their entirety.
(2) Building width and open area. The total cumulative width of
buildings, structures, solid fences and walls more than 36 inches in
height shall not occupy more than 50% of the width of a parcel as
measured along a line substantially parallel to the Hudson River,
and the maximum building width for each structure or building
shall not be more than 75 feet measured along a line substantially
parallel to the Hudson River. Of the remaining open area, one
uninterrupted space shall be at least 30% of such parcel width,
unless the Planning Board approves more than one view corridor
totaling 30%. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining designated
historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is deemed by the
Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view corridors either to
or from the Hudson River.
(3) View corridor preservation. Views of the Hudson River and/or
natural features, including forested lands that are identified by the
Planning Board as important, shall be studied during site plan
review. Site layout and design shall consider public views and view
corridors and shall also consider the importance of views of the
Village from the Hudson River. A view corridor analysis, including
photo simulations showing the building(s) from public vantages
identified by the Planning Board, shall be required. The visual
impact of buildings or portions of buildings that can be seen from
public streets or spaces shall be mitigated to the maximum extent
practicable by reducing the height of the building, changing the
design of the building or moving the structures to alternate
locations on the site. Providing landscape screening is not an
alternative to reducing building height or placement of the building
in a less visible location. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining
designated historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is
deemed by the Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view
corridors either to or from the Hudson River.
(4) Open space. Open space should be maximized. To the greatest
extent reasonably practicable, any open space proposed on site
plans of adjoining properties should be connected and coordinated.
(5) Site analysis. The site plan applicant shall cause a site analysis to
be prepared that shall demonstrate that the proposed application
preserves and enhances the natural ecosystem on the site,
including consideration of the elements listed below to the
maximum extent practicable. Consideration shall be given to these
elements independently and to the way they work together to form
a natural ecosystem. Consideration shall also be given to historical
and cultural elements that lend character to the site. The applicant
§ 270-19 CHARTER § 270-19
C:883
shall demonstrate that the proposal incorporates the cultural
heritage and community character of the Village of Ossining to the
maximum extent practicable. The elements are:
(a) Streams and other water bodies.
(b) Forested uplands.
(c) Views of the Hudson River, forested uplands and other natural
features from public rights-of-way.
(d) Wetlands, swamps and vernal pools.

(f) Potential pedestrian connections to RiverWalk, the Croton
Aqueduct and existing neighborhoods.
(g) Archaeological sites and historical buildings.
(h) Habitat of threatened and endangered species.
(6) The minimum habitable floor area for each dwelling unit in the
CDD shall be 450 square feet for an efficiency or studio unit, 600
square feet for a one-bedroom unit, 750 square feet for a twobedroom
unit and 250 additional square feet for each additional
bedroom in units with three or more bedrooms.
G. Affordable housing. An applicant for a residential use in the CDD
District must provide affordable housing pursuant to the Affordable
Housing Law of the Village of Ossining, Chapter 62, Affordable
Housing.
H. Density bonus incentives.
(1) An applicant may apply to the Planning Board for one or more
density bonuses in exchange for providing amenities to the Village
of Ossining. The Planning Board may, at its discretion and subject
to the standards and considerations set forth below, grant density
bonuses as set forth in Appendix B173 for developments in the CDD
District in exchange for an applicant providing one or more of the
following amenities:
(a) Provision of a portion of publicly accessible RiverWalk:
providing a portion of RiverWalk that shall contain a trailway
having an average width of not less than 25 feet unless a lesser
width is permitted by the Planning Board. The trailway shall
not be less than 15 feet wide at any point except where space
constraints require a reduction in width. The trailway shall
consist principally of paved or wood surfaces, but may also
include landscaped areas, sitting areas, benches, gazebos and
173. Editor's Note: Appendix B, Bulk Requirements, is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 270-19 OSSINING CODE § 270-19
C:884
suitable lighting facilities. The dimensions and location of the
RiverWalk trailway may be negotiated with the Planning Board.
(b) Provision of public park or public open space: committing a
significant portion of contiguous land to public park or public
open space use, either by conveying the land to the Village for
such purposes or by other means, such as covenants and deed
restrictions. [Amended 8-2-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011]
(c) Historic preservation: preserving a significant portion of a
building(s) or structure(s) identified by the Planning Board and
agreed to by the Historic Review Commission as being of
historical, cultural or architectural significance.
(d) Use of green building techniques. After construction, the
development would achieve LEED Gold certification or a
similar level of standards. The Planning Board may modify the
LEED certification level if the applicant is able to demonstrate
that the particularities of the development warrant
modification due to site constraints or financial hardships that
are directly related to the development of the project. At a
minimum, the applicant would have to achieve LEED Silver
certification or similar standard. An applicant pursuing a
similar standard would have to demonstrate that the green
building technologies being incorporated into the project are
of similar or greater efficiency in water and energy usage and
produce a carbon footprint that is similar or smaller than the
LEED Gold certification.
(e) Brownfields remediation. Environmental remediation work
conducted on site that is not already substantially subsidized
by state or other funding but is required in order for the
development to take place.
(f) Contribution to non-site-related infrastructure improvements.
As negotiated by the Planning Board, non-site-related
improvements would be improvements that are not directly
needed, required or related to the development of the
proposed project but will be able to be utilized by the proposed
project's residents or will indirectly improve the project or its
site-related infrastructure. Infrastructure improvements may
include sidewalk, street or water and sewer system
improvements. This list is not exhaustive, and the Village
Engineer may provide recommendations to the Planning
Board.
(g) Provision of public artwork: incorporation of publicly
accessible artwork, sculpture, monument or other permanent
aesthetic structure on a development site or at a designated
off-site location as negotiated by the Planning Board.
§ 270-19 CHARTER § 270-19
C:885
§ 270-20. SP-N Station Plaza North District.
(h) Streambank restoration or stabilization: maximizing and
facilitating streambank restoration or stabilization of
tributaries of the Hudson River or other local streams.
(2) The Planning Board shall grant a density bonus of 10% for each
amenity offered, provided that the Planning Board finds that the
amenity is proportional to such density bonus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such bonus(es) shall not exceed the maximum number of
dwelling units specified in Appendix B.174
(3) The bonus permitted under this subsection is a bonus in
permissible density only and does not authorize deviation from or
enlargement of any bulk or lot coverage restrictions.
(4) In awarding a bonus for the amenities listed above, the Planning
Board shall:
(a) Consider the incentives being proposed by the applicant and
the degree to which the proposed amenity is compatible with
the goals and objectives for the zoning district and the Village
as a whole.
(b) Set forth, in detail, the amenities to be provided by the
applicant, how those amenities further the purposes of the
LWRP, if applicable, and Comprehensive Plan, and, in
particular, how they preserve and enhance the unique
aesthetic, recreational, environmental and/or historic qualities
and features of this district for the benefit and enjoyment of the
entire community and otherwise promote the public health,
safety and welfare of the community.
(c) Set forth, in detail, the relationship between the amenities
being provided and the bonus being awarded and shall specify
the rationale supporting the proportionality of the amenities to
the bonus. The public benefit improvements provided shall be
roughly proportional in nature and extent to the bonus
granted, and their proportionality shall be demonstrated by the
applicant and agreed to by the Planning Board. The cost of the
improvements need not equal the value of the benefits granted.
(5) The provision of public park or open space pursuant to
§ 270-19H(1)(b) shall not reduce the lot area for the purposes of
determining allowable density. [Added 7-17-2012 by L.L. No.

F. Special provisions applicable to the RDD.
(1) Calculating lot area. Land below the minimum high-water mark of
the Hudson River shall not be deemed developable for the purposes
of calculating lot area, density or coverage.
(2) Riverfront setback. No building, structure, parking area or loading
area shall be located within 50 feet of the more inland of: the
normal high-water line of the Hudson River or, if present, the inland
edge of a riprap or other embankment that runs parallel to the
Hudson River channel, unless its design requires a location closer
to such waterline, as determined by the Planning Board; provided,
however, that the Planning Board shall not permit the distance to
be any less than 25 feet. Said setback of 50 feet shall be derived by
measuring the average distance from any building or structure to
the more inland of the normal high-water line of the Hudson River
or the inland edge of a riprap or other embankment, if present, that
runs parallel to the Hudson River channel. In the case where it is
demonstrated to the Planning Board that the setback area is
necessary to be used for parking and loading purposes due to the
nature of the parcel of land, the proposed use of land, site layout
and design and that the use of the setback area shall not
significantly negatively impact the Hudson River, or areas prone to
flooding, the riverfront setback may be reduced further as agreed
to by the Planning Board during site plan approval.

(3) Open space and water-related activities. Open space and water
related activities should be maximized. To the greatest extent
reasonably practicable, any open space proposed on site plans of
adjoining properties should be connected and coordinated.
(4) Building width and open area. The total cumulative width of
buildings, structures, solid fences and walls more than 36 inches in
height shall not occupy more than 50% of the width of a parcel as
measured along a line substantially parallel to the Hudson River,
and the maximum building width for each structure or building
shall not be more than 75 feet measured along a line substantially
parallel to the Hudson River. Of the remaining open area, one
uninterrupted space shall be at least 30% of such parcel width,
unless the Planning Board approves more than one view corridor
totaling 30%. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining designated
historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is deemed by the
Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view corridors either to
or from the Hudson River.
(5) View corridor preservation. Views of the Hudson River and/or
natural features, including forested lands that are identified by the
Planning Board as important, shall be studied during site plan
review. Site layout and design shall consider public views and view
corridors and shall also consider the importance of views of the
Village from the Hudson River. A view corridor analysis, including
photo simulations showing the building(s) from public vantages
identified by the Planning Board, shall be required. The visual
impact of buildings or portions of buildings that can be seen from
public streets or spaces shall be mitigated to the maximum extent
practicable by reducing the height of the building, changing the
design of the building or moving the structures to alternate
locations on the site. Providing landscape screening is not an
alternative to reducing building height or placement of the building
in a less visible location. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining
designated historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is
deemed by the Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view
corridors either to or from the Hudson River.
(6) The minimum habitable floor area for each dwelling unit shall be
450 square feet for an efficiency or studio unit, 600 square feet for
a one-bedroom unit, 750 square feet for a two-bedroom unit and
250 additional square feet for each additional bedroom in units
with three or more bedrooms.
(7) Planning Board factors for review. In addition to the considerations
set forth in § 270-52, the Planning Board shall consider the
following factors during its review of site plan applications for
development within the RDD district:
(a) The proposed use and how it achieves the purposes outlined in
Subsection A above. Mixed use is considered an important
§ 270-22 CHARTER § 270-22
C:891
factor in creating a waterfront that will draw people,
commercial businesses and public use and enjoyment.
(b) The quality and extent of views from the adjacent public
streets and spaces through the property to the Hudson River.
(c) The design and relationship of development to the waterfront
as viewed from the Hudson River.
(d) The design and function of any easement or other public access
provided to the water's edge, including new bulkheading.
G. Affordable housing. An applicant for a residential use in the RDD
District must provide affordable housing pursuant to the Affordable
Housing Law of the Village of Ossining, Chapter 62, Affordable
Housing.
H. Planned Waterfront and Railway Development (PWRD) Overlay.
(1) Policy. Among the goals of the Village of Ossining in creating and
administering the PWRD use are the elimination of nonconforming
uses, protection and encouragement of water-dependent and
water-enhanced uses and promotion and development of mixed
residential, retail, commercial and open space uses on the
waterfront.
(a) This special permit use is created in furtherance of the
Comprehensive Plan for the Village and the Local Waterfront
Revitalization Program (LWRP), as amended, and the Main
Street and Waterfront Plan by Christopher Chadbourne &
Associates, September 1994, revised 1995.
(b) PWRD use and design controls are intended to enable the
development of more desirable living and working
environments than might otherwise be possible through the
strict application of other sections of this chapter.
(c) It is the policy of the Village of Ossining that PWRD special
permit approval will be granted by the Village Board, subject to
the criteria and special requirements set forth below.
(2) Criteria for PWRD special permit approval:
(a) The minimum site area shall be three acres. Note: "Site area"
shall be defined in accordance with Subsection H(6)(a).
(b) The site shall have frontage on the Hudson River and be within
500 feet of a railroad station, in order to ensure the promotion,
access and use of the waterfront while reducing the need for
and impact of vehicular traffic. The five-hundred-foot distance
shall be measured from the station or depot building and shall
not be measured from station platforms, parking areas or other
accessory structures or facilities. For purposes of this special
§ 270-22 OSSINING CODE § 270-22
C:892
permit use only, a site shall be deemed to have frontage on
the Hudson River if it is contiguous to land owned by the
Village which fronts on the Hudson River and which is to be
improved by the applicant for public access in accordance with
Subsection H(2)(c) below and an agreement made between the
Village and the applicant.
(c) At least 95% of the site frontage along the Hudson River shall
be provided as permanent publicly accessible open space in
the form of park areas, passive and/or active recreation areas,
children's playgrounds, plazas, pedestrian promenades,
boardwalks or other similar facilities. Said open space shall
have a minimum depth of 20 feet measured from the bulkhead
line, or mean high-water line if no bulkheading is present.
(d) The site development plan shall provide that at least 50% of the
gross project area be permanent publicly accessible open
space, which shall incorporate all the Village's policies
concerning waterfront access, especially park areas,
pedestrian waterfront promenades, boardwalks or other
similar facilities. For purposes of this special permit use only,
the "gross project area" shall include any parcel of land
contiguous to the site which is owned by the Village and which
is to be improved by the applicant for public access in
accordance with Subsection H(2)(c) above and an agreement
made between the Village and the applicant.
(e) The site development plan shall provide for unrestricted public
access to the waterfront, subject to the terms herein:
[1] The site development plan shall provide for a mix of the
uses set forth in Subsection H(2)(d) immediately below, in
any ratio, provided that a minimum of 50% and a maximum
of 97% of the building area shall be residential;
[2] At least 80% of the required parking must be provided in
on-site structured parking;
[3] The applicant must demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the
Village Board, that the requested density is justified by the

(5) Preserving views of the Hudson River and Hudson Palisades for
maximum enjoyment and benefit by the community as a whole.
(6) Encouraging the development of attractive, functional and
appropriately scaled uses along the riverfront in a manner that will
provide economic support for the Village while affirming the
character of the Village as a locus of riverfront activity.
Development or redevelopment should:
(a) Encourage appropriate uses of this area to preserve and
enhance mixed use of old industrial buildings that bring
creative small businesses, artisans and entrepreneurs to the
community and support the Village's economy.
(b) Bring people to the waterfront area and ensure appropriate
density of development, both commercial and residential.

Districts shall be as provided in Appendix B188 and subject to the
additional requirements specified in this section and elsewhere in this
chapter.
E. Parking requirements. Parking requirements in the Planned Waterfront
Districts shall be as provided in Appendix C189 and subject to
requirements specified elsewhere in this chapter.
F. Special provisions applicable to Planned Waterfront Districts.
(1) Open space. Open space should be maximized. To the greatest
extent reasonably practicable, any open space proposed on site
plans of adjoining properties should be connected and coordinated.
(2) Building width and open area. The total cumulative width of
buildings, structures, solid fences and walls more than 36 inches in
height shall not occupy more than 50% of the width of a parcel as
measured along a line substantially parallel to the Hudson River,
and the maximum building width for each structure or building
shall not be more than 75 feet measured along a line substantially
parallel to the Hudson River. Of the remaining open area, one
uninterrupted space shall be at least 30% of such parcel width,
unless the Planning Board approves more than one view corridor
totaling 30%. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining designated
historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is deemed by the
Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view corridors either to
or from the Hudson River.
(3) View corridor preservation. Views of the Hudson River and/or
natural features, including forested lands that are identified by the
Planning Board as important, shall be studied during site plan
review. Site layout and design shall consider public views and view
corridors and shall also consider the importance of views of the
Village from the Hudson River. A view corridor analysis including
photo simulations showing the building(s) from public vantages
identified by the Planning Board, shall be required. The visual
impact of buildings or portions of buildings that can be seen from
public streets or spaces shall be mitigated to the maximum extent
practicable by reducing the height of the building, changing the
design of the building or moving the structures to alternate
locations on the site. Providing landscape screening is not an
alternative to reducing building height or placement of the building

in a less visible location. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining
designated historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is
deemed by the Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view
corridors either to or from the Hudson River.
(4) The site plan applicant shall cause a site analysis to be prepared
that shall demonstrate that the proposed application preserves and
enhances the natural ecosystem on the site, including
consideration of the elements listed below, to the maximum extent
practicable. Consideration shall be given to these elements
independently and to the way they work together to form a natural
ecosystem. Consideration shall also be given to historical and
cultural elements that lend character to the site. The applicant
shall demonstrate that the proposal incorporates the cultural
heritage and community character of the Village of Ossining to the
maximum extent practicable. The elements are:
(a) Streams and other water bodies.
(b) Forested uplands.
(c) Views of the Hudson River, forested uplands and other natural
features from public rights-of-way.
(d) Wetlands, swamps and vernal pools.

(2) The permitted uses and bulk requirements may differ among the
districts and are set forth in Appendixes A and B.190 The
subdistricts shall be mapped on the Village Zoning Map.191
H. Affordable housing. An applicant for a residential use in the Planned
Waterfront District, or any subdistrict thereof, must provide affordable
housing pursuant to the requirements of Chapter 62, Affordable
Housing.
I. Planned Waterfront special permit:
(1) Purpose. Numerous contiguous lots in the Planned Waterfront
District have common ownership, but are not officially assembled.
Keeping those properties in common ownership will help promote
the objectives of the waterfront zoning by allowing greater
flexibility in site plans. These larger sites will be able to
accommodate additional densities and provide more amenities to
the Village than smaller, separate lots would be able to provide.
Developing a planned waterfront will further the objectives
outlined in the Comprehensive Plan by promoting assemblages of
parcels that create opportunities for transit-oriented development
surrounding the Metro-North station and Ossining Dock by infilling
parcels with diverse land uses. The purpose of this
subsection is to allow the granting of a special permit that, in
exchange for the provision of certain amenities, will allow
increased densities for particular developments meeting the
criteria below.
(2) Eligibility. Applications can be made for a special permit allowing
for increased density in the Planned Waterfront Districts based on
the procedures outlined in Article XI for parcels comprised of at
least three acres. Contiguous or adjacent lots (even if separated by
a public road) where the aggregate area of such lots is at least
three acres and development of such lots is proposed in one
integrated site plan shall qualify for such special permit.
(3) As part of the site plan for the planned development, the applicant
must include the following:
(a) Lots under the same ownership that are part of this special
permit application shall be combined and considered as one
lot.
(b) Provision of at least one amenity pursuant to Subsection I(4)
immediately below.
190. Appendix A, Use Tables, and Appendix B, Bulk Requirements, are both included at the end
of this chapter.
191. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the offices of the Building Inspector.
§ 270-23 CHARTER § 270-23
C:901
(c) Provision of affordable housing pursuant to the requirements
of the Affordable Housing Law of the Village of Ossining,
Chapter 62, Affordable Housing.
(4) Density bonus incentives. An applicant may apply to the Planning
Board for one or more density bonuses in exchange for providing
amenities to the Village of Ossining. The Planning Board may, at its
discretion and subject to the standards and considerations set forth
below, grant density bonuses as set forth in Appendix B192 for
developments in the PW District in exchange for an applicant
providing one or more of the following amenities:
(a) Provision of a portion of publicly accessible RiverWalk:
providing a portion of RiverWalk that shall contain a trailway
having an average width of not less than 25 feet, unless a
lesser width is permitted by the Planning Board. The trailway
shall not be less than 15 feet wide at any point except where
space constraints require a reduction in width. The trailway
shall consist principally of paved or wood surfaces, but may
also include landscaped areas, sitting areas, benches, gazebos
and suitable lighting facilities. The dimensions and location of
the RiverWalk trailway may be negotiated with the Planning
Board.
(b) Provision of public park or public open space: committing a
significant portion of contiguous land to public park or public
open space use, either by conveying the land to the Village for
such purposes or by other means such as covenants and deed
restrictions. [Amended 8-2-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011]
(c) Historic preservation: preserving a significant portion of a
building(s) or structure(s) identified by the Planning Board and
agreed to by the Historic Review Commission as being of
historical, cultural or architectural significance.
(d) Use of green building techniques. After construction, the
development would achieve LEED Gold certification or a
similar level of standards. The Planning Board may modify the
LEED certification level if the applicant is able to demonstrate
that the particularities of the development warrant
modification due to site constraints or financial hardships that
are directly related to the development of the project. At a
minimum, the applicant would have to achieve LEED Silver
certification or similar standard. An applicant pursuing a
similar standard would have to demonstrate that the green
building technologies being incorporated into the project are
of similar or greater efficiency in water and energy usage and
produce a carbon footprint that is similar or smaller than the
LEED Gold certification.
192. Editor's Note: Appendix B, Bulk Requirements, is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 270-23 OSSINING CODE § 270-23
C:902
(e) Brownfields remediation: environmental remediation work
conducted on site that is not already substantially subsidized
by state or other funding but is required in order for the
development to take place.
(f) Contribution to non-site-related infrastructure improvements.
As negotiated by the Planning Board, non-site-related
improvements would be improvements that are not directly
needed, required or related to the development of the
proposed project but will be able to be utilized by the proposed
project's residents or will indirectly improve the project or its
site-related infrastructure. Infrastructure improvements may
include sidewalk, street or water and sewer system
improvements. This list is not exhaustive, and the Village
Engineer may provide recommendations to the Planning
Board.
(g) Provision of public artwork: incorporation of publicly
accessible artwork, sculpture, monument or other permanent
aesthetic structure on a development site or at a designated
off-site location as negotiated by the Planning Board.
(h) Streambank restoration or stabilization: maximizing and
facilitating streambank restoration or stabilization of
tributaries of the Hudson River or other local streams.
(5) The Planning Board shall grant a density bonus of 10% for each
amenity offered, provided that the Planning Board finds that the
amenity is proportional to such density bonus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such bonus(es) shall not exceed the maximum number of
dwelling units specified in Appendix B.193
(6) The bonus permitted under this subsection is a bonus in
permissible density only and does not authorize deviation from or
enlargement of any bulk or lot coverage restrictions.
(7) In awarding a bonus for the amenities listed above, the Planning
Board shall:
(a) Consider the incentives being proposed by the applicant and
the degree to which the proposed amenity is compatible with
the goals and objectives for the zoning district and the Village
as a whole.
(b) Set forth, in detail, the amenities to be provided by the
applicant, how those amenities further the purposes of the
LWRP, if applicable, and Comprehensive Plan, and, in
particular, how they preserve and enhance the unique
aesthetic, recreational, environmental and/or historic qualities
and features of this district for the benefit and enjoyment of the

entire community and otherwise promote the public health,
safety and welfare of the community;
(c) Set forth, in detail, the relationship between the amenities
being provided and the bonus being awarded and shall specify
the rationale supporting the proportionality of the amenities to
the bonus. The public benefit improvements provided shall be
roughly proportional in nature and extent to the bonus
granted, and their proportionality shall be demonstrated by the
applicant and agreed to by the Planning Board. The cost of the
improvements need not equal the value of the benefits granted.
(8) The provision of public park or public open space pursuant to
§ 270-23I(4)(b) shall not reduce the lot area for the purposes of
determining allowable density. [Added 7-17-2012 by L.L. No.

E. Parking requirements. Parking requirements in the IR District shall be
as provided in Appendix C196 and subject to requirements specified
elsewhere in this chapter.
F. Special provisions applicable to the IR District.
(1) Calculating lot area. Land below the minimum high-water mark of
the Hudson River shall not be deemed developable for the purposes
of calculating lot area, density or coverage.
(2) Riverfront setback. No building or structure shall be located within
50 feet of the more inland of: the normal high-waterline of the
Hudson River or, if present, the inland edge of a riprap or other
embankment, unless its design requires a location closer to such
waterline, as determined by the Planning Board; provided,
however, that the Planning Board shall not permit the distance to
be any less than 25 feet. Said setback of 50 feet shall be derived by
measuring the average distance from any building or structure to
the more inland of the normal high-water line of the Hudson River
or the inland edge of a riprap or other embankment, if present,
except that no part of any building or structure shall be closer than
25 feet to the more inland of the normal high-water line or the
inland edge of a riprap or other embankment, if present. No
parking or loading area shall be situated within such setback.
(3) Open space and water-related activities. Open space and waterrelated
activities should be maximized. Where possible, any open
space proposed on site plans of adjoining properties should be
connected and coordinated.
(4) Building width and open area. The total cumulative width of
buildings, structures, solid fences and walls more than 36 inches in
height shall not occupy more than 50% of the width of a parcel as
measured along a line substantially parallel to the Hudson River,
and the maximum building width for each structure or building
shall not be more than 75 feet measured along a line substantially
parallel to the Hudson River. Of the remaining open area, one
uninterrupted space shall be at least 30% of such parcel width,
unless the Planning Board approves more than one view corridor
totaling 30%. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining designated
historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is deemed by the
Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view corridors either to
or from the Hudson River.
(5) View corridor preservation. Views of the Hudson River and/or
natural features, including forested lands that are identified by the
Planning Board as important shall be studied during site plan
review. Site layout and design shall consider public views and view
corridors and shall also consider the importance of views of the
196. Editor's Note: Appendix C, Parking Requirements, is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 270-24 OSSINING CODE § 270-24
C:906
Village from the Hudson River. A view corridor analysis, including
photo simulations showing the building(s) from public vantages
identified by the Planning Board, shall be required. The visual
impact of buildings or portions of buildings that can be seen from
public streets or spaces shall be mitigated to the maximum extent
practicable by reducing the height of the building, changing the
design of the building or moving the structures to alternate
locations on the site. Providing landscape screening is not an
alternative to reducing building height or placement of the building
in a less visible location. Excluded are existing Village of Ossining
designated historical buildings or any parcel or structure that is
deemed by the Planning Board as irrelevant to preserving view
corridors either to or from the Hudson River.
(6) Site analysis. The site plan applicant shall cause a site analysis to
be prepared that shall demonstrate that the proposed application
preserves and enhances the natural ecosystem on the site,
including consideration of the elements listed below, to the

elements independently and to the way they work together to form
a natural ecosystem. Consideration shall also be given to historical
and cultural elements that lend character to the site. The applicant
shall demonstrate that the proposal incorporates the cultural
heritage and community character of the Village of Ossining to the
maximum extent practicable. The elements are:
(a) Streams and other water bodies.
(b) Forested uplands.
(c) Views of the Hudson River, forested uplands and other natural
features from public rights-of-way.
(d) Wetlands, swamps and vernal pools.

(1) An applicant may apply to the Planning Board for one or more
density bonuses in exchange for providing amenities to the Village
of Ossining. The Planning Board may, at its discretion and subject
to the standards and considerations set forth below, grant density
bonuses as set forth in Appendix B197 for developments in the IR
District in exchange for an applicant providing one or more of the
following amenities:
(a) Provision of a portion of publicly accessible RiverWalk:
providing a portion of RiverWalk that shall contain a trailway
having an average width of not less than 25 feet, unless a
lesser width is permitted by the Planning Board. The trailway
shall not be less than 15 feet wide at any point except where
space constraints require a reduction in width. The trailway
shall consist principally of paved or wood surfaces, but may
also include landscaped areas, sitting areas, benches, gazebos
and suitable lighting facilities. The dimensions and location of
the RiverWalk trailway may be negotiated with the Planning
Board.
(b) Provision of public park or public open space: committing a
significant portion of contiguous land to public park or public
open space use, either by conveying the land to the Village for
such purposes or by other means, such as covenants and deed
restrictions. [Amended 8-2-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011]
(c) Historic preservation: preserving a significant portion of a
building(s) or structure(s) identified by the Planning Board and
agreed to by the Historic Review Commission as being of
historical, cultural or architectural significance.
(d) Use of green building techniques. After construction, the
development would achieve LEED Gold certification or a
similar level of standards. The Planning Board may modify the
LEED certification level if the applicant is able to demonstrate
that the particularities of the development warrant
modification due to site constraints or financial hardships that
are directly related to the development of the project. At a
minimum, the applicant would have to achieve LEED Silver
certification or similar standard. An applicant pursuing a
similar standard would have to demonstrate that the green
building technologies being incorporated into the project are
of similar or greater efficiency in water and energy usage and
produce a carbon footprint that is similar or smaller than the
LEED Gold certification.

by state or other funding but is required in order for the
development to take place.
(f) Contribution to non-site-related infrastructure improvements.
As negotiated by the Planning Board, non-site-related
improvements would be improvements that are not directly
needed, required or related to the development of the
proposed project but will be able to be utilized by the proposed
project's residents or will indirectly improve the project or its
site-related infrastructure. Infrastructure improvements may
include sidewalk, street or water and sewer system
improvements. This list is not exhaustive, and the Village
Engineer may provide recommendations to the Planning
Board.
(g) Provision of public artwork: incorporation of publicly
accessible artwork, sculpture, monument or other permanent
aesthetic structure on a development site or at a designated
off-site location as negotiated by the Planning Board.
(h) Streambank restoration or stabilization: maximizing and
facilitating streambank restoration or stabilization of
tributaries of the Hudson River or other local streams.
(2) The Planning Board shall grant a density bonus of 10% for each
amenity offered, provided that the Planning Board finds that the
amenity is proportional to such density bonus. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, such bonus(es) shall not exceed the maximum number of
dwelling units specified in Appendix B.198
(3) The bonus permitted under this subsection is a bonus in
permissible density only and does not authorize deviation from or
enlargement of any bulk or lot coverage restrictions.
(4) In awarding a bonus for the amenities listed above, the Planning
Board shall:
(a) Consider the incentives being proposed by the applicant and
the degree to which the proposed amenity is compatible with
the goals and objectives for the zoning district and the Village
as a whole.
(b) Set forth, in detail, the amenities to be provided by the
applicant, how those amenities further the purposes of the
LWRP, if applicable, and Comprehensive Plan, and, in
particular, how they preserve and enhance the unique
aesthetic, recreational, environmental and/or historic qualities
and features of this district for the benefit and enjoyment of the

safety and welfare of the community.
(c) Set forth, in detail, the relationship between the amenities
being provided and the bonus being awarded and shall specify
the rationale supporting the proportionality of the amenities to
the bonus. The public benefit improvements provided shall be
roughly proportional in nature and extent to the bonus granted
and their proportionality shall be demonstrated by the
applicant and agreed to by the Planning Board. The cost of the
improvements need not equal the value of the benefits granted.
(5) The provision of public park or public open space pursuant to
§ 270-24H(1)(b) shall not reduce the lot area for the purposes of
determining allowable density. [Added 7-17-2012 by L.L. No.

Subsection K(1).
F. Procedure for alteration, demolition or new construction affecting
Historic Landmarks or Historic Architectural Design Districts.
[Amended 8-2-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011]
(1) The Historic Preservation Commission shall classify all buildings
within a district so as to differentiate between those structures that
contribute to the district's historical and architectural value and
those that do not. An historic properties survey shall be conducted
at an interval of no more than every 20 years to ensure that the
Commission's records are current.
(2) The Historic Preservation Commission shall develop a listing of
changes that may be commenced on buildings or sites classified as
landmarks or historic districts. Such changes shall be such that the
Commission feels they will not substantially cause to deteriorate or
lower the overall architectural and historical ambience and
character of the district. This listing of changes shall guide
property owners and tenants in the district and the Historic
Preservation Commission in determining whether or not a
proposed exterior change will significantly affect the character of
the Historical and Architectural Design District.
(3) The Historic Preservation Commission may grant certificates of
appropriateness for proposed changes not appearing on the listing
§ 270-25 OSSINING CODE § 270-25
C:918
of changes if they determine that the proposed changes will not
be detrimental to the district or to the landmark. The Historic
Preservation Commission shall hold a public meeting on the
application, with notice given at least seven days in advance of
the hearing in the Village's official newspaper. The Historic
Preservation Commission may provide rules for participants
wishing to speak in favor or against an application to follow at
public meetings. The Commission shall act upon a properly
completed application form within 60 days of the monthly
submission deadline. Failure of the Commission to take action
within the prescribed period of time shall constitute approval.
(a) The following criteria will be used when granting a certificate
of appropriateness:
[1] Properties contributing to the historic character of the
district shall be retained, with minimal alteration to their
features;
[2] Alteration of existing properties shall maintain
compatibility with their historic character and that of the
surrounding district; and
[3] New construction shall be compatible with the overall
architectural and historic character of the district.
(b) To determine compatibility with existing historic and
architectural character, the following factors shall be
considered:
[1] The proposed new construction or alteration's general
design, appropriateness and character in relation to the
property itself, surrounding properties and the
neighborhood;
[2] The scale of the proposed new construction or alteration in
relation to the property itself, surrounding properties and
the neighborhood;
[3] Materials, color and texture and their relation to similar
features of other neighborhood properties;
[4] Visual compatibility with existing neighborhood
properties, including the proportions of the property's
front facade, arrangement and proportion of windows and
other openings within the facade, roof shape and the
rhythm of spacing of properties on the street, including
setback; and
[5] The importance of historic, architectural or other related
features to the significance of the property.
§ 270-25 CHARTER § 270-25
C:919
(4) Notwithstanding any inconsistent ordinance, local law, code, rule
or regulation concerning the issuance of building permits, no
change in any exterior design or in a district, landmark or building
covered by a facade easement agreement shall be commenced
without a certificate of appropriateness from the Historic
Preservation Commission nor shall any building permit for such
change be issued without such a certificate of appropriateness
having first been issued. The certificate of appropriateness
required by this section shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any
building permit that may be required by any law, local law, code,
rule or regulation of the Village of Ossining.
(5) Application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made, in
writing, upon forms prescribed by the Historic Preservation
Commission and shall be accompanied by the required fee as set
forth in the fee schedule of the Village Board200 and shall contain
the following:
(a) Name, address and telephone number of the applicant;
(b) Location of buildings, structures or land;
(c) The exterior architectural features which are proposed to be
changed;
(d) Building elevations that include the proposed change;
(e) Samples of colors or materials to be used in the proposed
change;
(f) Where the proposed change includes signs or lettering, a scale
drawing showing the type of lettering, all dimensions and
colors, a description of materials to be used and the method of
illumination, if any, and a plan showing the location on the
building or property; and
(g) Such other information as may be from time to time required.
(6) If an applicant requires Board of Architectural Review approval as
well, application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made
simultaneously with the filing of an application with the Board of
Architectural Review.
(7) Application for certificates of appropriateness for nonstructural
changes to buildings shall be exempt from providing elevations or
perspective drawings.
(8) New construction shall be sympathetic with and not disruptive of
architectural styles or historic value in an historic district and shall
generally conform to the United States Secretary of the Interior's
Standards for Rehabilitation.

§ 270-25 OSSINING CODE § 270-25
C:920
G. Issuance of certificate of appropriateness. Within 30 days after an
application is heard before the Historic Preservation Commission and is
deemed complete or within such further time as the applicant may
allow, the Historic Preservation Commission shall determine whether
the proposed construction, reconstruction or alteration of the exterior
architectural feature involved will be appropriate to the preservation of
the district or landmark for the purposes of this section. In passing
upon appropriateness, the Historic Preservation Commission shall
consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and
architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design,
arrangement, texture, material and color of the exterior architectural
feature involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior
architectural features of other structures in the immediate
neighborhood and the Secretary of the Interior's standards for
rehabilitation. Failure of the Historic Preservation Commission to take
action within the prescribed period of time shall constitute approval.
H. Hardship.
(1) In such cases where it can be demonstrated that denial of a
certificate of appropriateness for construction, reconstruction or
alteration of an exterior architectural feature will involve a
substantial hardship to the applicant, such a certificate may be
issued if it can also be shown that though inappropriate to the
structure involved, said proposed action will not adversely affect
the district generally. Such a certificate may be issued without
substantial detriment to the public welfare and without substantial
deviation from the intent and purposes of this section. The
applicant may apply for appropriate relief from the requirements of
this article or conditions imposed by the Commission. In order to
prove the existence of hardship, an applicant shall establish that
whether for income-producing purposes or for private use, it is
either unable to make any economically viable use of the property
or that the property's value is reduced to the extent that only a bare
residue of the value remains.
(2) An applicant may seek relief from the Commission for the denial of
a certificate of appropriateness for a proposed demolition if
substantial hardship can be proven in accordance with the
provisions of this section. In order to prove the existence of
hardship, an applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a
proposed demolition has been denied shall establish that:
(a) The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return,
regardless of whether that return represents the most
profitable return possible;
(b) The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by
the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return; and
§ 270-25 CHARTER § 270-25
C:921
(c) Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property
and preserving it have failed.
(3) A hardship applicant whose primary purpose or mission is
philanthropic, eleemosynary, religious or charitable and whose
certificate of appropriateness was proposed in furtherance of
philanthropic, eleemosynary, religious or charitable purposes shall
establish that the Commission's action seriously interferes with the
applicant's ability to continue the current use of the property and
seriously interferes with the applicant's philanthropic,
eleemosynary, religious and charitable purposes.
(4) The Commission may solicit expert testimony or require that the
applicant make submissions concerning any or all of the following
information before it makes a determination on the application for
relief:
(a) An estimate of the cost of the proposed construction,
alteration, demolition or removal and an estimate of any
additional cost that would be incurred to comply with the
decision of the Commission.
(b) A report from a licensed engineer or architect with
demonstrated qualifications and experience in rehabilitation as
to the structural soundness of any structures on the property
and their suitability for rehabilitation.
(c) The estimated market value as determined by a qualified
appraiser of the property:
[1] In its current condition;
[2] After completion of the proposed construction, alteration,
demolition or removal;
[3] After any changes recommended by the Commission; and
[4] In the case of a proposed demolition, after renovation of
the existing property for continued use.
(d) In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an
architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser or other
real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation
regarding the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of
the existing structure on the property.
(e) The amount paid for the property, the date of purchase and the
party from whom purchased, including a description of the
relationship, if any, between the owner of record or applicant
and the person from whom the property was purchased, and
any terms of financing between the seller and buyer.
§ 270-25 OSSINING CODE § 270-25
C:922
(f) If the property is income producing, the annual gross income
from the property for the previous two years; itemized
operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two
years; and depreciation and annual cash flow before and after
debt service, if any, during the same period.
(g) The remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing
secured by the property and annual debt service, if any, for the
previous two years.
(h) All appraisals obtained within the previous two years by the
owner or applicant in connection with purchase, financing or
ownership of the property.
(i) Any listing of the property for sale or rent, the price asked and
offers received, if any, within the previous two years.
(j) The assessed value of the property according to the two most
recent assessments.
(k) Real estate taxes for the previous two years.
(l) The form of ownership or operation of the property, whether
sole proprietorship, for-profit or not-for-profit corporation,
limited partnership, joint venture or other.
(m) Any other information deemed necessary by the Commission to
make a determination of economic hardship.
I. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Historic
Preservation Commission relating to a hardship or a certificate of
appropriateness may, within 30 days of the decision, file a written
application with the Zoning Board of Appeals for review of the decision.
Reviews shall be conducted based on the same record that was before
the Commission and using the same criteria.
J. Enforcement shall be pursuant to this chapter.
K. Maintenance and repair required.
(1) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the ordinary
maintenance and repair of any exterior architectural feature of a
landmark or property within and contributing to an historic district
which does not involve a change in design, material, color or
outward appearance. Nothing in this section shall be construed to
prevent the construction, reconstruction, alteration or demolition
or issuance of a building permit of any exterior architectural
feature which the Building Inspector shall determine is required by
public safety because of dangerous or unsafe conditions.
(2) No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as
a landmark or a contributing building within an historic district
shall permit the property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so
§ 270-25 CHARTER § 270-25
C:923
as to result in the deterioration of any exterior architectural feature
which would, in the judgment of the Historic Preservation
Commission, produce a detrimental effect upon the character of
the historic district as a whole or the life and character of the
property itself. Examples of such deterioration include:
(a) Deterioration of exterior walls or other vertical supports;
(b) Deterioration of roofs or other horizontal members;
(c) Deterioration of exterior chimneys;
(d) Deterioration or crumbling of exterior stucco or mortar;
(e) Ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs or

(f) Deterioration of any feature so as to create a hazardous
condition which could lead to the claim that demolition is
necessary for the public safety; and
(g) Demolition by intent or neglect.

station canopy shall be permitted, provided that each such sign
shall not be more than two feet in height by five feet in width and
shall not be internally illuminated. The maximum size of signage on
gas pumps shall be four square feet in area on each side of each
pump.
§ 270-29 CHARTER § 270-29
C:947
(8) Directional signs for vehicles. Within parking lot and driveway
areas, signs may be erected, as needed, to direct patrons to specific
businesses and to control traffic. Each such sign shall measure no
greater than six square feet in area and shall be no more than four
feet in height. Signs may include the names of businesses,
directional words such as "in" and "out," and similar information,
but no other advertising shall be permitted. The directional signage
within each property should be designed with a uniform theme, and
the signs should be placed in a manner that avoids clutter and does
not distract drivers.
(9) Directional signs for pedestrians. For a building with a front
setback measuring 10 feet or greater, one freestanding sign to
guide pedestrians to the entrance shall be permitted for each 100
feet of frontage. Each such sign shall measure no greater than four
square feet in area and shall be no more than five feet in height.
Signs may include the names of businesses and directional
information, but no other advertising shall be permitted.
E. General requirements.
(1) Except in residential districts, signs inside a window, whether
permanent or impermanent, are permitted in addition to any signs
otherwise permitted. A window sign shall not exceed 25% of the
exposed window area or not more than 16 square feet per window.
(2) Illuminated signs, where permitted, shall not remain lit later than
the closing hour of business or 9:00 p.m., whichever is later. In no
event shall such a sign remain illuminated later than 11:30 p.m.,
except by approval from the Planning Board upon a finding that it is
in the public interest or necessary for the safety of the Village to
remain illuminated beyond that time. Illuminated signs may be
turned back on at dusk the following day, except when an
establishment is closed.
(3) The following types of signs or artificial lighting are prohibited:
(a) Billboards.

impermanent material, used for commercial promotional
purposes or otherwise for more than 30 days.
(g) No sign that is part of or supported by a building shall be
erected upon the roof of such building, nor shall such sign
extend above the height of the building.
F. Sign permits.
(1) No sign other than a professional sign, announcement or real
estate sign, but including temporary signs for promotional use,
shall be erected, moved, enlarged, altered or reconstructed without
first obtaining a sign permit from the Building Inspector.
(2) A permit for a temporary sign for promotional use shall not be
issued more than twice within a twelve-month period per
establishment.
A. Off-street parking. Off-street parking spaces, open or enclosed, are
subject to the following provisions:
(1) Off-street parking requirements for each District shall be as
provided in Appendix C.203 For uses which do not fall within the
categories listed in Appendix C, the Planning Board will determine
the necessary parking needed to prevent frequent parking on the
street by persons visiting or connected with each such use.
(2) Areas computed as parking spaces. Areas which may be computed
as open or enclosed off-street parking spaces include any private
garage, carport or other area available for parking, other than a
street. Each space shall be independently accessible with the
exception that one space behind each garage or carport space may
be counted as a parking space to meet parking requirements.
Otherwise, tandem parking with access from only one direction
shall be computed as one space.
(3) All driveways, blacktop or loading docks must be at least four feet
away from the property line in residential districts (S-50, S-75,
S-100, S-125, T, MF-1, MF-2, PRD), and all driveways, blacktop or
loading docks must be at least two feet away from the property line
in nonresidential districts (PW-a, PW-b, PW-c, SP-N, SP-S, CDD,
RDD, IR, O-R, VC, PC, NC-1, NC-2, GB and P-O) unless otherwise
noted in Appendix B. [Amended 8-2-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011]
203. Editor's Note: Appendix C, Parking Requirements, is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 270-29 CHARTER § 270-30
C:949
(4) Size of spaces. Each parking space shall be a minimum of nine feet
wide by 18 feet deep. The minimum parking aisle width shall be 24
feet for spaces at a ninety-degree angle, 18 feet for spaces at a
sixty-degree angle, 13 feet for spaces at a forty-five-degree angle
and 12 feet for spaces at a thirty-degree angle. Where parking is
arranged back-to-back, each parking space may share a common
backup space. Entrance and exit lanes shall not be computed as
parking space, except for driveways in one- and two-family
residences, as set forth in Subsection A(1).
(5) Prohibited parking areas. Except in the PC District, parking shall
not be permitted in the required front yard except as set forth in
Subsection A(1). In addition, except as provided in Subsection A(1),
parking shall not be permitted anywhere in the front yard of any
single- or two-family dwelling, except that where the Building
Inspector finds that, due to unique conditions, compliance with this
limitation will cause practical difficulties and tend to increase onstreet
parking by residents, he may authorize parking anywhere in
the front yard of such dwellings, except for that portion thereof
which is directly in front of the principal building, exclusive of
garage structures.
(6) Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided.
Such access shall consist of at least one twelve-foot-wide lane for
parking areas with less than 20 spaces and at least two twelve-footwide
lanes for parking areas with 20 spaces or more. No entrance
or exit for any off-street parking area with a capacity of more than
four spaces shall be located within 50 feet of any street
intersection, nor exceed a grade in excess of 6% within 25 feet of
any street line, nor 10% at any other point.
(7) Drainage and surfacing. All parking areas shall be properly drained
and all such areas, except for parking spaces accessory to a one- or
two-family dwelling, shall be provided with a dustless surface in
accordance with specifications of the Village of Ossining. The
maximum slope of a parking area shall not exceed 5%.
(8) Combined spaces. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each
use shall apply to the full extent. Where it can be conclusively
demonstrated that one or more such uses will be generating a
demand for parking spaces primarily during periods when the
other use or uses is not or are not in operation, the Planning Board
may reduce the total parking spaces required by up to 100% of the
parking spaces required for that use with the least requirement.
(9) Enclosed facilities.
(a) Required parking areas may be constructed within or under
any portion of a main building, provided that the access
driveway does not at any point have a grade in excess of 10%.
§ 270-30 OSSINING CODE § 270-30
C:950
Access driveways should be placed to intersect streets with
lower pedestrian traffic and less retail frontage so as to avoid
disrupting the streetscape on principal pedestrian streets.
(b) Except for one- or two-family dwellings, parking is not
permitted in the portion of the first floor (or of any basement or
cellar not entirely below ground) extending a minimum of 40
feet back from the front building line. Such area shall be
utilized for a permitted main use, other than parking, in the
zoning district in which the building is located. This
requirement applies to buildings in which parking is a main
use.
(c) Notwithstanding the above, in a building on a corner lot,
parking is permitted in the front portion of the first floor (or
basement or cellar not entirely below ground) facing the street
with the lower pedestrian traffic function. Along the street
frontage, such parking shall be concealed with facade
materials comparable to those used on the remainder of the
building. To the extent practical, eye-level fenestration with
translucent, but not transparent, glass shall be provided, or the
portion of the building devoted to parking shall be screened
with landscaping subject to approval by the Planning Board.
(d) All buildings with enclosed parking shall provide horizontal
and vertical articulation across the entire facade of the
building on all streets to provide for visual interest. To fulfill
this requirement, an articulation element shall be required at
least every 10 feet, measured both horizontally and vertically.
(10) Location and ownership. Required accessory parking spaces, open
or enclosed, shall be provided upon the same lot as the use to which
they are accessory or elsewhere, provided that no required spaces
are located farther than 200 feet in walking distance from such lot,
or 700 feet in the VC Zone. In all such cases, the parking spaces
shall conform to all the regulations of the district in which the
parking spaces are located, and in no event shall such parking
spaces be located in any residence district unless either the use to
which the spaces are accessory is located in such residence
districts or upon approval by the Planning Board. Such spaces shall
be in the same ownership as the use to which they are accessory
and shall be subject to deed restrictions, approved by the Planning
Board, binding the owner and his heirs and assigns to maintain the
required number of spaces available, either throughout the
existence of the use to which they are accessory or until such
spaces are provided elsewhere, in a location and manner
acceptable to the Planning Board.
(11)On lots divided by district boundaries. When a parking lot is
located partly in one district and partly in another district, the
regulations for the district requiring the greater number of parking
§ 270-30 CHARTER § 270-30
C:951
spaces shall apply to the entire lot. Parking spaces on such lot may
be located without regard to district lines, provided that no such
parking spaces shall be located in any residence district, unless
either the use to which they are accessory is located in such district
or upon approval by the Planning Board.
(12)Waiver for changes of use in existing buildings in the VC, SP-N and
NC-2 Districts. The parking space requirements shall be waived in
the VC, SP-N, and NC-2 districts where all of the following
conditions are met:
(a) The change is from one permitted or conditional use in the
district to another permitted or conditional use in the district.
(b) The proposal does not involve construction of a new building or
alterations or additions to an existing building which will result
in an increase in gross floor area that will take away already
existing off-street parking spaces and the Planning Board shall
make a finding that the proposed new construction or addition
will not be able to provide any additional off-street parking due
to the existing conditions of the site.
(c) The proposal does not result in the loss of existing off-street
parking spaces.
(d) The new use shall continue to have access to any parking
spaces to which the existing use in the same location was
granted access.
B. Off-street loading. Off-street loading berths, open or enclosed, are
permitted as accessory to any use (except one- or two-family dwellings),
subject to the following provisions:
(1) Loading requirements. Accessory off-street loading berths shall be
provided for any use specified herein. Any land which is developed
as a unit under single ownership and control shall be considered a
single lot for the purpose of these loading requirements.
Reasonable and appropriate off-street loading requirements for
structures and uses which do not fall within the categories listed
herein shall be determined by the Planning Board upon
consideration of all factors entering into the loading needs of each
such use.
(a) For a public library, museum or similar quasi-public institution
or governmental building, community center, hospital or
sanitarium, nursing or convalescent home, institution for
children or the aged or school:
[1] If the floor area does not exceed 10,000 square feet: one
berth.
§ 270-30 OSSINING CODE § 270-30
C:952
[2] For each additional 25,000 square feet or fraction thereof:
one additional berth.
(b) For buildings with professional, governmental or business
offices or laboratory establishments:
[1] If the floor area is less than 8,000 square feet: none.
[2] If the floor area amounts to between 8,000 and 25,000
square feet: one berth.
[3] For each additional 25,000 square feet or major fraction
thereof up to 100,000 square feet: one additional berth.
[4] For each additional 50,000 square feet or major fraction
thereof: one additional berth.
(c) For retail sales and service establishments:
[1] If the floor area is less than 8,000 square feet: none.
[2] If the floor area amounts to between 8,000 and 25,000
square feet: one berth.
[3] If the floor area exceeds 25,000 square feet: one additional
berth for each additional 25,000 square feet of floor area
or major fraction thereof.
(d) For undertakers and funeral homes: one berth for each chapel.
Such berths shall be at least 10 feet wide, 20 feet long and 14
feet high.
(e) For hotels or similar establishments: one berth for each 25,000
square feet, or major fraction thereof, of floor area.
(f) For manufacturing, wholesale and storage uses and for drycleaning
and rug-cleaning establishments and laundries: one
berth for each 10,000 square feet of floor area or less; and one
additional berth for each additional 20,000 square feet of floor
area, or major fraction thereof, so used.
(g) For multiple dwellings in structures with a height of over 2.5
stories: one berth for each structure or for each 150 dwelling
units, or major fraction thereof, whichever results in the lesser
number.
(2) Size of spaces. Except as provided hereinbefore, each required
loading berth shall be at least 12 feet wide, 35 feet long and 15 feet
high.
(3) Location and access. Unobstructed access, at least 12 feet wide, to
and from a street shall be provided. Such access may be combined
with access to a parking lot. All permitted or required loading
berths shall be on the same lot as the use to which they are
§ 270-30 CHARTER § 270-30
C:953
accessory, except as provided in Subsection B(4). No entrance
or exit for any loading area shall be located within 50 feet of
any street intersection. No loading berths shall be located In any
required yard and shall be screened where visible from any
residential district boundary.
(4) Joint facilities. Permitted or required loading berths, open or
enclosed, may be provided in spaces designed to jointly serve two
or more adjacent establishments, provided that the number of
required berths in such joint facilities shall not be less than the
aggregate of all such requirements.
(5) On lots divided by district boundaries. When a lot is located partly
in one district and partly in another district, the regulations for the
district requiring the greater number of loading berths shall apply
to the entire lot. Loading berths on such lot may be located without
regard to district lines, provided that no such berths shall be
located in any residence district, unless either the use to which
they are accessory is permitted in such district or upon approval by
the Planning Board.
C. Parking regulations in multiple dwellings. Whenever space is provided
for the parking of five or more vehicles in the open, such spaces shall be
individually identified by means of pavement markings. The parking of
motor vehicles is prohibited within 15 feet of any wall, or portion
thereof, of a dwelling for two or more families, which wall contains
windows (other than bathroom or kitchen windows) with a sill height of
less than eight feet above the level of said parking space. No service of
any kind shall be permitted to be extended to users of the lot, including
automobile service, repair or fueling, and no gasoline, oil, grease or
other supplies shall be stored or sold in any such lot or in any garage on
such lot. Parking areas shall be thoroughly screened, subject to
approval by the Planning Board. Generally, such screening shall be at
least six feet in height and, if composed of plants, shall not be less than
three feet in height, but capable of reaching at least eight feet in height
at maturity.
D. Regulations for parking spaces adjacent to lots in any residence
district.
(1) Wherever a parking area of over five spaces is within 15 feet of the
side or rear lot lines of a lot in any residence district, said parking
lot shall be thoroughly screened from such adjoining lot, subject to
approval by the Planning Board. Generally, such screening shall be
eight feet in height and, if composed of plants, shall not be less than
three feet in height, but capable of reaching eight feet in height at
maturity.
(2) Whenever a parking area of over five spaces is located across the
street from any land in a residence district or abuts a lot in a
§ 270-30 OSSINING CODE § 270-30
C:954
residence district, it shall be thoroughly screened, subject to
approval by the Planning Board.
E. Driveways. No driveway shall provide access to a lot located in another
district, which lot is used for any use prohibited in the district in which
such driveway is located. No driveway shall provide access to a lot
located in a nonresidential district across land in a residential district.
(1) The maximum slope of a driveway shall not exceed 10%.
(2) A driveway serving a commercial use or more than two residences
shall be not less than 20 feet wide for two-way operation or 10 feet
wide for one-way operation and shall be adequate and sufficient in
size, location and design to accommodate the maximum traffic,
parking and loading needs and the access of fire-fighting
equipment and police or emergency vehicles.
F. Trailers and boats.
(1) The storage or parking and use of a trailer by any person or
persons is hereby prohibited in all districts, except that:
(a) One camping trailer not over 20 feet in length may be stored,
but not used for any purpose, on an occupied lot in any
residence district, provided that such trailer is not stored
within any required yard, nor between the street line and the
principal building.
(b) Where a building permit has been issued for the construction
or alteration of a building, the Building Inspector may issue a
temporary permit for one trailer for a period not to exceed six
months. Said trailer may be occupied during the term of the
temporary permit and shall be situated upon the lot for which
the building permit has been issued.
(2) Not more than one boat per dwelling unit may be stored on an
occupied lot in any residence district, provided that such boat is not
stored within any required yard nor between the street line and the
principal building nor in a required parking space nor blocking a
required parking space.
G. Commercial vehicles in a residential district.
(1) Parking of commercial vehicles in a residential district shall not be
permitted, except for cars, vans and pickups not exceeding 20 feet
in length and eight feet in width.
(2) Not more than one such commercial vehicle may be parked on a

reason of the deposit, discharge or dispersal of liquid or solid wastes, in
any form, in a manner or amount so as to cause permanent damage to
the soil and stream or to adversely affect the surrounding area; or by
reason of the creation of noise, vibration, electromagnetic or other
disturbance; or by reason of illumination by artificial light or light
reflection beyond the limits of the lot on, or from which, such light or
light reflection emanates; or which involves any dangerous fire,
explosive, radioactive or other hazard or which can cause injury,
annoyance or disturbance to any of the surrounding properties or to
their owners and occupants; and any other process or use which is
unwholesome and noisome and may be dangerous or prejudicial to

less than 15 feet from the side and rear lot lines and not less than five
feet from the main building.
E. Such pool shall not occupy more than 25% of the rear yard area,
excluding all private garages or other accessory buildings or
structures.
F. If the water for such pool is supplied from a private well, there shall be
no cross-connection with the public water supply system.
G. If the water for such pool is supplied from the public water supply
system, the inlet shall be six inches above the overflow level of said
pool.
H. Such pool shall be chemically treated in a manner sufficient to maintain
the bacterial standards established by the provisions of the New York
Sanitary Code relating to public swimming pools.
I. No permit shall be granted for the installation or construction of said
swimming pool unless the plan thereof shall meet the minimum
construction requirements of the Building Department of the Village of
Ossining and unless the Village's Engineer, or a licensed professional
engineer of New York State, shall have certified that the drainage of
such pool is adequate and will not interfere with the public water
supply system, with existing sanitary facilities or with the public
streets.
J. No loudspeaker or amplifying device shall be permitted which can be
heard beyond the lot lines of the lot on which said pool is located.
K. No lighting or spotlighting shall be permitted which will project light
rays beyond the lot lines of the lot on which said pool is located.

H. The entire portion of the premises upon which such pool is located shall
be completely enclosed with a good quality fence of not less than four
feet in height.
I. Where the proposed pool is of such height or design that protective
fencing is not required or is impractical, the Building Inspector shall, at
his discretion, issue a permit for the erection of said pool without such
fencing. The Building Inspector shall, however, first make a finding to
the effect that, in his opinion, said pool has equal protection from entry
as would be afforded by the erection of a fence as provided for in
Subsection H of this section.
A. General landscaping and environmental requirements.
(1) The Planning Board is authorized to adopt conditions in connection
with its approvals of applications, including, but not limited to,
requirements to post bonds, pertaining to the incorporation,
maintenance and replacement of landscape materials in any
project requiring site development plan approval and for the
environmental control of such projects.
§ 270-33 OSSINING CODE § 270-34
C:958
(2) Proposed developments subject to site plan approval shall be
designed to the greatest extent reasonably practicable to preserve
the natural features of the site, including, but not necessarily
limited to, water bodies, wetlands, steep slopes, hilltops,
ridgelines, views to and from the Hudson River, major stands of
trees, outstanding natural topography, significant geological
features and other areas of scenic, ecological and historic value; to
utilize such features in a harmonious fashion; and to enhance the
visual appearance of the development. Such developments shall be
in compliance with Chapter 248, Trees, and Chapter 227,
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control, and
all other applicable laws and regulations.
(3) As identified in the Comprehensive Plan, energy and water
conservation are important to the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the Village of Ossining. Proposed site plans shall be
designed to the greatest extent reasonably practicable to
incorporate energy and water conservation measures. Examples of
such measures include ENERGY STAR-rated products and
practices.
B. Steep slopes.
(1) A steep slope is defined as any geographical area having a
topographical gradient of 15% or greater (ratio of vertical distance
to horizontal distance), whether man-made or natural, and whether
created by a retaining structure or not.
(2) In connection with development that is subject to site plan review,
the following shall apply: Construction on or regrading of steeply
sloped areas greater than 15% but less than 25% should be
minimized to the greatest extent reasonably practicable in areas
measuring over 500 square feet. There shall be no construction on
or regrading of areas measuring over 500 square feet with steep
slopes equal to or greater than 25% unless the Planning Board
makes a specific finding that such construction or regrading is
warranted by considerations that make alternative approaches
impracticable in view of overall planning considerations (including
the overall objectives of the Comprehensive Plan and the LWRP, if
applicable) and will be carried out in a manner consistent with best
management and engineering practices for such construction or
regrading.
(3) Where development pursuant to an approved site plan is to take
place on steep slopes, the following construction practices shall be
followed, in addition to compliance with applicable provisions of
the Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
Law, Chapter 227:
(a) Grading and development shall preserve salient natural
features, keep cut fill operations to a minimum and ensure
§ 270-34 CHARTER § 270-34
C:959
§ 270-35. Environmental quality review.
It is the responsibility of the applicant to see that all requirements of the
New York State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA),206 as amended,
conformity with topography so as to create the least erosion
potential and adequately handle the volume and rate of
velocity of surface water runoff.
(b) Disturbed soils shall be stabilized as soon as practicable.

ARTICLE VII
Nonconforming Uses, Nonconforming Lots and Noncomplying
Buildings
§ 270-38. Applicability.
§ 270-39. Nonconforming uses.
A. This article shall apply to:
(1) All buildings, structures and uses existing on the effective date of
this chapter that do not conform to the requirements set forth in
this chapter;
(2) All buildings, structures and uses that were legally nonconforming
uses or legally noncomplying buildings or lots under the Zoning
Code in effect immediately prior to the effective date of this
chapter; and
(3) All buildings and uses that become noncomplying and/or
nonconforming by reason of any subsequent amendment to this
chapter.
B. Continuance.
(1) Any building, structure or use lawfully existing under the
provisions of this chapter in effect at the time of the creation of said
building or structure or the establishment of said use, or prior to
the establishment of any zoning regulation in the Village of
Ossining, although not conforming or complying with the
provisions of this chapter for the district in which it is situated, may
be continued subject to compliance with the conditions set forth in
this article.
(2) Any legal use in existence that by this chapter is made a use that
requires a special permit in the district in which it is located shall
be presumed to have a special permit to the extent such use is
legally conforming as of the date immediately prior to the effective
date of this chapter or any amendment thereto.
A. Repairs, maintenance and incidental alterations. Upon the issuance of a
building permit, nonstructural incidental alterations, as well as repairs
to and maintenance of both structural and nonstructural parts, may be
made to any portion of a building or structure occupied, in whole or in
part, by a nonconforming use.
B. Structural alterations.
(1) No alterations involving structural integrity shall be made to or in a
building or structure occupied, in whole or in part, by a
nonconforming use, except when, upon the issuance of a building
permit, such alterations are made:
§ 270-38 CHARTER § 270-39
C:963
(a) In order to accommodate a conforming use; or
(b) Wholly within the interior of the building or structure so that
the alteration is not evident from the exterior of the building or
structure, and so long as the alteration does not result in an
enlargement, extension or increase in intensity prohibited
pursuant to this article; or
(c) In the course of an enlargement or extension permitted under
the provisions of this article; or
(d) In the course of a reconstruction or restoration permitted
under the provisions of this article.
(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow any increase in
noncompliance of dimensional regulations applicable to any
building or structure, except as expressly permitted under this
article.
C. Change of location. Nonconforming uses shall not be moved, in whole
or in part, to another location on the same lot or parcel of land
unoccupied by such use on the date by which the use was rendered
nonconforming on the effective date of this chapter or any amendment
thereto. Nonconforming uses shall not be moved to any other lot or
parcel where such use would be nonconforming.
D. Change to another nonconforming use. No nonconforming use shall be
changed to another nonconforming use without approval by the Zoning
Board of Appeals, and then only to a use that the Zoning Board of
Appeals has found:
(1) Is of the same or of a more restricted nature;
(2) Will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and
(3) Will not cause adverse aesthetic, environmental or ecological
impacts on the property or on surrounding areas or otherwise be
injurious to the neighborhood or detrimental to the public welfare.
E. Improvement of nonconforming uses. So that nonconforming uses may
gradually be brought into greater conformance with this chapter and
the adverse external effects of such nonconforming uses may be
reduced, the owner of the land, building or structure so used may be
permitted to make limited changes to such building or structure or
nonconforming use in conjunction with a site plan whereby, through the
use of landscaped screening and buffer areas, control of noise, smoke,
odors, lighting, architectural changes, location and layout of parking
lots and access drives, or any other appropriate means, these purposes
may be achieved. Such plan shall be presented to the Planning Board
which may grant approval or approval with modifications, provided said
agency finds that the purposes of this section will be achieved. For
purposes of such site plan review, the Planning Board may seek
§ 270-39 OSSINING CODE § 270-39
C:964
§ 270-40. Undersized lots.
recommendations from any other Village Board, committee or
commission the Planning Board determines is appropriate.
F. Enlargements and extensions. No nonconforming use shall be enlarged
or extended, nor shall the intensity of the use be increased, except
pursuant to the following:
(1) Any nonconforming use of a building or structure may be extended
throughout any parts of the building or structure that were
obviously or manifestly arranged or designed only for such use at
the time said use was rendered nonconforming.
(2) A nonconforming single-family, two-family, or multifamily dwelling
may be enlarged or extended in accordance with the dimensional
regulations specified for the district in which it is located so long as
such enlarged or extended portion shall not exceed more than 10%
of the livable residential floor area in the dwelling unit in existence
on the date on which the use became nonconforming.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no increase in the
number of dwelling units beyond the lawful number in existence on
the date on which the use became nonconforming.
G. Discontinuance. If a nonconforming use or a portion thereof,
substantially ceases for any reason for a total of six months during any
twelve-month period, or is changed to a conforming use for any period
of time, any future use of the land, building, structure or land shall be in
conformity with this chapter. Substantial cessation of activities
consistent with or required for the operation of such nonconforming use
and/or substantial vacancy of the building or structure in which the
nonconforming use was conducted shall be deemed to constitute
discontinuance thereof within the meaning of this chapter.
H. Removal of building or structure housing nonconforming use. If any
building or structure in which any nonconforming use is conducted or
maintained is hereafter removed, the subsequent use of the land on
which such building or structure was located and the subsequent use of
any building or structure thereon shall be in conformity with the
standards specified by this chapter for the district in which such land is
located.
A. Merger. Adjacent lots under the same ownership are required to be
combined and considered as one lot where such merger is necessary to
cause the lot(s) and/or improvements thereon to comply or be more in
compliance with the area and/or dimensional regulations for the
district(s) in which they are located. Any conflict in designation or
identification by the Village Assessor's Office shall have no effect on this
provision for the purpose of application of this chapter.

C:965
§ 270-41. Noncomplying buildings.
§ 270-42. Reconstruction and/or restoration.

the district in which it is located shall be deemed to be complying,
provided that all of the following conditions are met:
(1) The lot met the minimum area and dimensional requirements
immediately prior to the effective date of this chapter or any
amendment thereto.
(2) All applicable district regulations other than minimum lot area, lot
width and lot depth are complied with, except that the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall have the authority to modify lot yard
requirements insofar as deemed appropriate and justifiable in the
public interest.
(3) There were not lots that were both contiguous to and in the same
ownership as the undersized lot on the effective date of this chapter
or any amendment thereto.
A. Noncomplying buildings. A building or structure that is conforming in
use, but does not conform to any dimensional regulation/area
requirement of this chapter applicable to the district in which such
building or structure is located, shall be deemed to be a noncomplying
building.
B. No permit shall be issued that will result in the increase of any such
noncompliance, but any noncomplying building, or portion thereof, may
be altered to decrease its dimensional noncompliance.
C. Removal of noncomplying building. Except as otherwise specifically
provided in this article, if any noncomplying building, or part thereof, is
removed, the subsequent use of the land for any building or structure
shall be in conformity with the standards specified by this chapter for
the district in which such land is located.
D. Reconstruction and/or restoration. Reconstruction or restoration of a
noncomplying building may occur only pursuant to the provisions of
this article.
A. Any noncomplying building or building or structure housing a
nonconforming use destroyed or damaged by any means by the greater
of either to an extent of more than 75% of the market value of such
building or structure above the foundation at the time of such
destruction or damage, as determined by the Building Inspector in
consultation with the Village Assessor and any Village consultant, or to
an extent of more than 50% of its total floor area shall not be
reconstructed, restored or used except in conformity and compliance
with the provisions of this chapter. In the event that any destruction or
damage of an existing building or structure produces an unsafe
§ 270-40 OSSINING CODE § 270-42
C:966
condition for which the Building Inspector orders or permits further
demolition or removal of floor area or an action that further decreases
the market value of the building or structure, such demolition or
removal shall not be included in the calculations of this subsection.
B. Any noncomplying building or building or structure housing a
nonconforming use destroyed or damaged by any means to an extent of
less than the greater of § 270-42A may be reconstructed and/or
restored and any nonconforming continued, provided that the
reconstruction and/or restoration is commenced within one year of the
date of such destruction or damage and completed within two years of
said date, provided that the building, structure or use is not enlarged or
extended. Such reconstruction or restoration shall occur in accordance
with a plan approved by the Planning Board so as to result, where
reasonable, in greater conformity with this chapter. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, the Building Inspector shall permit for good cause the
extension of the dates by which reconstruction and/or restoration must
be commenced and/or completed.
C. No building permit shall be issued for reconstruction and/or restoration
pursuant to this section without submission to the Building Inspector of
a certified statement by the owner's architect or engineer describing, in
detail, the extent of the damage or destruction, an accurate calculation
or good faith estimate of the floor area damaged or destroyed and any
other information reasonably requested by the Building Inspector and
related to his/her analysis under this article.

condition or requirement specified or made under the provisions of
this chapter.
(2) The exact location of any district boundary shown on the Zoning
Map.209
B. Variances.
209. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the offices of the Building Inspector.
§ 270-47 OSSINING CODE § 270-48
C:976
(1) On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or determination
made by the Building Inspector or on referral of an applicant to the
Board by an approving agency acting pursuant to this chapter, the
Zoning Board of Appeals is authorized to vary or modify the strict
letter of this chapter where its literal interpretation would cause
practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships, as defined in this
section, in such manner as to observe the spirit of the chapter, to
secure public safety and welfare and to do substantial justice.
(2) Area variances. Where an applicant requests a variance of the area
requirements of this chapter, the Board may grant a variance in the
application of the provisions of this chapter in the specific case. In
making its determination, the Board shall take into consideration
the benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed
against the detriment to the health, safety and welfare of the
neighborhood or community of such grant. In making its
determination the Board shall consider whether:
(a) An undesirable change will be produced in the character of the
neighborhood or a detriment to nearby properties will be
created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) The benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some
method feasible for the applicant to pursue, other than an area
variance;
(c) The requested area variance is substantial;
(d) The proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on
the physical or environmental conditions in the neighborhood
or district;
(e) The alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration
shall be relevant to the decision of the Zoning Board of
Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the
area variance.
(3) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting area variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it deems necessary and adequate
and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(4) Use variances. Where, because of unnecessary hardship relating to
the land for a use not allowed in the district in which the land is
located, an applicant requests a variance of the use requirements
of this chapter, the Board may grant a variance in the application of
the provisions of this chapter in the specific case, provided that no
use variance shall be granted without a showing by the applicant
that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused
unnecessary hardship to the applicant. In order to prove
unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall demonstrate that for
§ 270-48 CHARTER § 270-48
C:977
each and every permitted use under this chapter for the district in
which the applicant's property is located:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(5) The Zoning Board of Appeals, in granting use variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it deems necessary and adequate to
address the unnecessary hardship proven by the applicant and at
the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
(6) The needs or desires of a particular owner or tenant, or of a
particular prospective owner or tenant, shall not, either alone or in
conjunction with other factors, afford any basis for the granting of a
variance. The fact that the improvements already existing at the
time of the application are old, obsolete, outmoded or in disrepair
or the fact that the property is then unimproved shall not be
deemed to make the plight of the property unique or to contribute
thereto.
(7) Where said Board finds the zoning classification of a particular
property to be conducive to the deprivation of the reasonable use of
the land or buildings and where said Board finds the same
condition to apply generally to other land or buildings in the same
neighborhood or zoning district, said Board shall call this condition
to the attention of the Village Board.
(8) In all cases where the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance
from the strict application of the requirements of this chapter, it
shall be the duty of such Board to attach such conditions and
safeguards as may be required in order that the result of its action
may be as nearly as possible in accordance with the spirit and
intent of this chapter.
(9) Appeals. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Zoning Board
of Appeals hereunder may, within 30 days of the filing of the
decision with the office of the Village Clerk, appeal pursuant to
Article 78 of the New York State Civil Practice Laws and Rules.

(1) The names of said owners shall be taken as they appear on the last
completed tax roll of the Village.
(2) Provided that due notice shall have been published and that there
shall have been substantial compliance with the remaining
provisions of this section, the failure to give notice in exact

taken by the Zoning Board of Appeals in connection with the
granting of any appeal or variance.
B. All appeals and applications made to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
be in writing and shall be accompanied by the required fee payable to
the Village of Ossining. Such submission shall be submitted to the

with applications shall not be returnable regardless of disposition of the
case by the Board.
C. Each appeal or application shall fully set forth the circumstances of the
case, shall refer to the specific provision of the law involved and shall
exactly set forth, as the case may be, the interpretation that is claimed,
the details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds on which
it is claimed that the same should be granted.
D. Transmission of copy of official notice of public hearing.
(1) Should any appeal involve any of the following conditions, the
Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall transmit to the
designated office or official a copy of the official notice of the public
hearing not later than 10 days prior to the date of the hearing.

prescribed for any district, any portion of which is located
within 500 feet of the boundary of any village or town.
(2) The designated official for counties shall be the clerk of the county
legislature. In villages and towns, the designated official shall be
the clerk of the municipality.
E. Prior to the date of any public hearing, the Secretary of the Zoning
Board of Appeals may transmit to the Secretary of the Planning Board a
copy of any appeal or application, together with a copy of the notice of
such hearing. The Planning Board may submit to the Zoning Board of
Appeals an advisory opinion on said appeal or application at any time
prior to the rendering of a decision by the Board of Appeals.
F. Prior to final action, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall refer any matter
involving any of the areas in accordance with §§ 277.61 and 277.71 of
the Westchester County Administrative Code and §§ 239-l, 239-m and
239-n of the New York State General Municipal Law to the Westchester
County Planning Board.
G. Every decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be recorded in
accordance with standard forms adopted by the Board, shall fully set
forth the circumstances of the case, shall contain a full record of the
findings on which the decision is based and, if such decision is not in
accordance with the recommendation of the Planning Board, the
reasons therefor. Every decision of said Board shall be by resolution,
and each such resolution shall be filed in the office of the Village.
H. The Secretary shall keep minutes of the Board's proceedings showing
the vote of each member upon every question or, if absent or failing to
vote, indicating such fact. The Secretary shall keep records of the
Board's examinations and official actions, all of which shall be
immediately filed in the office of the Village Clerk and shall be a public
record.
I. All provisions of this chapter relating to the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall be strictly construed. Said Board, as a body of limited jurisdiction,
shall act in full conformity with all provisions of law and of this chapter
and in compliance with all limitations contained therein.
J. Unless construction is commenced and diligently pursued within six
months of the date of the granting of a variance, such variance shall
become null and void, unless renewed upon application to the Zoning
Board of Appeals.

§ 270-51. Conditional uses.
H. The Chairperson of the Planning Board shall notify the Village Manager
and the Director of Planning and Development in writing on or about

of the conditional uses for which this chapter requires such permits in
the district in which such use is proposed to be located. In approving
any such use, the Planning Board shall take into consideration and
make any necessary modifications to the site plan to ensure the public

accessible for fire, ambulance and police protection.
(2) That the proposed use shall be of such location, size and character
that, in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and
orderly development of the district in which it is proposed to be
situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of
adjacent properties in accordance with the zoning classification of
such properties.
(3) That the proposed use will be consistent with the requirements of
this chapter, the Code of the Village of Ossining, the Village of
Ossining Comprehensive Plan and other applicable plans and

proposed, considering the property's size, location, topography and
natural resources.
§ 270-50 OSSINING CODE § 270-51
C:982
(7) That, in addition to the above, in the case of any use located in, or
directly adjacent to, a residence district:
(a) The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith,
its site layout and its relation to access streets shall be such
that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use
and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not
be hazardous or inconvenient to or incongruous with said
residence district or conflict with the normal traffic of the
neighborhood.
(b) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of
landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings.
(c) The subject property is adequately sized and suitably
configured to provide screening needed to the adjacent
residential district.

deem advisable. The names of said owners shall be taken as they
appear on the last completed tax roll of the Village. Provided that due
notice shall have been published as required by law and that there shall

any of the areas specified in §§ 277.61 and 277.71 of the Westchester
County Administrative Code and §§ 239-l, 239-m and 239-n of the New
York State General Municipal Law to the Westchester County Planning
Board.

C:983
§ 270-52. Site development plan rules and regulations.
F. The Planning Board may require that conditional use permits be
periodically renewed. Such renewal shall be granted following due
public notice and hearing and may be withheld only upon a
determination by the Planning Board to the effect that such conditions
as may have been prescribed by the Planning Board in conjunction with
the issuance of the original permit have not been or are no longer being
complied with. In such cases, a period of 60 days shall be granted to the
applicant for full compliance prior to the revocation of said permit. The
sixty-day time period for full compliance only applies for the first
violation. If any subsequent violation occurs, the conditional use permit
will be revoked.

two-family detached residential uses that are requesting additions,
alterations or structures accessory thereto. All other principal uses,
including the construction of single-family or two-family detached
residential uses that are part of a proposed subdivision, and all
conditional or special permit uses shall require a site development plan
approval prior to the issuance of a building permit or certificate of
occupancy. No lot or parcel of land shall be used except in conformity
with an approved site development plan, when required.
B. Objectives. In considering and acting upon site development plans, the
Planning Board shall take into consideration the public health, safety
and welfare and the comfort and convenience of the public in general
and of the prospective occupants of the proposed development and of
the immediate neighborhood, in particular, and may prescribe such
appropriate conditions and safeguards as may be required in order to
further the expressed intent of this chapter and to accomplish the
following objectives, in particular:
(1) Traffic access. All proposed traffic access will be adequate but not
excessive in number; adequate in width, grade, alignment and
visibility; not located too near street corners or other major access
points; located on a roadway capable of adequately and safely
handling the additional traffic; and will provide for other similar
safety considerations.
(2) Circulation and parking. Adequate off-street parking and loading
spaces are provided to prevent parking of vehicles on public
streets. The interior circulation system will be adequate to provide
safe accessibility to all required off-street parking.
(3) Landscaping and screening. All recreation areas, parking and
service areas will be reasonably screened from the view of adjacent
residential lots and streets at all seasons of the year. As approved
by the Planning Board or the Building Inspector, a bond shall be
posted for the maintenance and/or replacement of the screening.
§ 270-51 OSSINING CODE § 270-52
C:984
(4) Compatibility. Signs and lights will be compatible and in scale with
building elements and will not represent significant impact on the
environment or result in a waste of the land and other natural
resources of the Village. To the greatest possible extent,
development will be in harmony with the natural environment, and
adequate compensatory devices will be prescribed to offset
potential significant deterioration resulting from the project. Signs
shall conform to size, shape, color, materials and location as called
for by the Planning Board and/or Building Department.
(5) Development. The site development plan elements, including
buildings, parking, drainage, utility services, circulation, signs and
lighting, will not adversely affect the potential of adjacent
properties or the property under review from its highest and best
use and will not exceed the capabilities of existing municipal roads
or utility services, including, but not limited to, water and sewer.
(6) Complete streets. The Village's adopted Complete Streets Policy
shall be considered and applied by the Planning Board when
deemed context appropriate in the review and approval of site
development plans under the provisions of this chapter. The
application of such Complete Streets Policy, which seeks to
encourage convenience of access and mobility on any sidewalk,
street and highway by all users of all ages and abilities, including
motorists, pedestrians, bicyclists, and public transportation users
through the use of complete streets design features, shall include
consideration of best practices, as may be evidenced by guidelines
and criteria such as those established by the American Association
of State Highway Transportation Officials (AASHTO), New York
State Department of Transportation (NYS DOT), United States
Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration
Office of Safety (US DOT, FHWA), and the National Complete
Streets Coalition, as well as those requirements included in the
Americans with Disability Act (ADA) and the Village of Ossining
Comprehensive Plan. [Added 7-15-2015 by L.L. No. 4-2015]
C. Procedure. The Planning Board shall follow procedures as prescribed
by Article 7, § 7-725, of the Village Law and by this chapter.
(1) Prior to application for a building permit, certificate of occupancy
or certificate of use, where required, site development plan
approval shall be secured from the Planning Board. The applicant
has the option of choosing between a formal application for
approval and an informal submission for review. For purposes of an
informal submission, the applicant should provide as much
information as required by the Planning Board. The preapplication
review by the Planning Board shall not constitute a formal review,
and no approval can be granted based on it. At this time, the
applicant should outline any modifications he/she is requesting
from the requirements specified herein.
§ 270-52 CHARTER § 270-52

involving any of the areas specified in Article XIII, § 270-59D, and
§§ 277.61 and 277.71 of the Westchester County Administrative
Code, and §§ 239-l, 239-m and 239-n of the New York State General
Municipal Law to the Westchester County Planning Board.
(4) The Planning Board, in the review of any application, may refer
such application to such engineering, planning, legal, technical,
environmental or other professionals as the referring board deems
reasonably necessary to enable it to review the application as
required by law.
(a) At the time of submission of any application, or during the
review process, the reviewing board or official may require the
establishment of an escrow account from which withdrawals
shall be made to reimburse the Village for the costs of
professional review services.
(b) The Planning Board shall not consider or consider further any
application for which a deposit is required under this chapter
until the Treasurer has certified that the deposit has been
made.

applicant is notified, in writing, of the requirement for such
additional deposit, the reviewing board or official may suspend
its review of the application.
(d) After all pertinent charges have been paid, the Village shall
refund to the applicant any funds remaining on deposit.
D. Site plan elements. The applicant shall cause a site plan map to be
prepared, at a scale sufficient in size to permit an adequate review, by
an architect, civil engineer, surveyor, landscape architect or allied field.
The site plan shall include those of the elements listed herein which are
appropriate to the proposed development or use as indicated by the
Planning Board in the presubmission conference. This information, in
total, shall constitute the site plan and shall be the same information,
drawings and supplementary material normally understood to be

E. Informal review and pre-submission conference. An applicant, at his/
her discretion, may submit, prior to a formal application for final site
development plan approval, an application for informal site
development plan review. The applicant shall submit all application
materials in as much detail as the Planning Board shall determine it
requires to come to a preliminary conclusion as to the merits of the
proposal. Should variances from the requirements of this chapter be
contemplated, their nature and degree should be specified. In the event
an applicant needs both Planning Board approval and a use or area
variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals, the applicant should apply
to the Planning Board first. In such case, the Planning Board shall
promptly refer the matter to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Planning
Board shall not approve the application until any required variances
have been approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
F. Procedures to ensure that local actions comply with the Local
Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP) policies.
(1) Planning Board. The Planning Board shall notify the Village
Manager and Waterfront Commission of pending actions using a
§ 270-52 CHARTER § 270-52
C:989
coastal assessment form. It shall then find and certify, in writing,
that:
(a) The action will not substantially hinder the achievement of any
of the policies and purposes of the LWRP;
(b) If the action will substantially hinder the achievement of any
policy of the LWRP, the following three requirements are
satisfied: no reasonable alternatives exist which would permit
the action to be undertaken in a manner which would not
substantially hinder the achievement of such policy; the action
will minimize all adverse effects on such policy to the maximum
extent practicable; and the action will result in an overriding
regional or statewide public benefit. Such certification shall
constitute a determination that the action is consistent to the
maximum extent practicable with the LWRP; or
(c) The action is not consistent with the policies and purposes of
the LWRP, since it would substantially hinder the achievement
of one or more policies and would not satisfy all of the
requirements identified in Subsection F(1)(b) above.
(2) The Planning Board shall prepare its written findings and
certification according to the same schedule required for approval/
disapproval of conditional use requests, site plans and subdivision
plats. The written findings and certification of consistency shall be
filed with the Village Clerk before an action is undertaken. No
action under the Planning Board's jurisdiction shall occur without
the Board having certified that the action is consistent with the
policies and purposes of the LWRP.
(3) Village Board.
(a) The Village Board or a Village agency, when proposing to
undertake, approve or fund a Type I or unlisted action in the
waterfront area, shall prepare or cause to be prepared a
coastal assessment form for the proposed action.
(b) Following the preparation of an environmental impact
statement (EIS) or the issuance of a negative declaration
pursuant to SEQRA, a Village agency shall refer the coastal
assessment form (CAF), any EIS or other pertinent information
for that action to the Village Manager and to the Village Board
which reviews and determines whether the action is consistent
with the policies and purposes of the LWRP.
(c) Prior to its undertaking, approving or funding a proposed Type
I or unlisted action in the waterfront area, and for each action
referred by a Village agency, the Village Board shall find and
certify that the action is or is not inconsistent with the LWRP.
[See findings above under the Planning Board procedures,
Subsection F(2).]
§ 270-52 OSSINING CODE § 270-52
C:990
(d) The Village Board shall complete its review of the proposed
action's consistency and prepare a written finding to the
referring Village agency within 30 days of the referral date.
The Village Board may refer such actions for review to any
municipal agency, including, but not limited to, the Planning
Board, Village Manager's Office, Building Department, Zoning
Board of Appeals, Village Engineer, Historic Review
Commission, Environmental Advisory Council and Waterfront
Commission.
(e) The written findings and certification of the Village Board shall
be filed with the Village Clerk before the action is undertaken,
approved or funded.
(f) No action shall be undertaken, approved or funded unless the
Village Board certifies its consistency with the policies and
purposes of the LWRP.
G. Final review and approval.
(1) An applicant, at his/her discretion, may submit, for final site
development plan approval, an application. The applicant shall
submit all application materials as required by § 270-52D. Should
variances from the requirements of this chapter be contemplated,
their nature and degree should be specified. In the event an
applicant needs both Planning Board approval and a use or area
variance from the Zoning Board of Appeals, the applicant should
apply to the Planning Board first. In such case, the Planning Board
shall promptly refer the matter to the Zoning Board of Appeals. The
Planning Board shall not approve the application until any required
variances have been approved by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(2) The Planning Board will review the proposed plan with the general
and specific criteria set forth in this chapter and other applicable
rules and regulations of the Village of Ossining, state or county. The
Planning Board shall authorize the setting of a public hearing for
consideration of final site development plan approval. In addition to
publication of notice of such public hearing as required by law, the
Planning Board shall cause such notice to be mailed at least 10
days before the hearing to all owners of property which lies within
300 feet of any boundary line of the property which is the subject
matter of the application and to such other owners as the Planning
Board may deem advisable. The names of said owners shall be
taken as they appear on the last completed tax roll of the Village.
Provided that due notice shall have been published as required by
law and that there shall have been substantial compliance with the
remaining provisions of this section, the failure to give notice in
exact conformance herewith shall not be deemed to invalidate
action taken by the Planning Board in connection with such
application. In the event that a conditional use approval is required,
the Planning Board shall simultaneously consider both
§ 270-52 CHARTER § 270-52
C:991
applications. In reviewing a site development plan application
which has been granted a special permit by the Village Board, the
Planning Board shall ensure conformity with any special permit
requirements. The final site development plan and all supporting
materials shall be subject to review and consultation. The Board
shall make a determination on the application within 62 days of
the close of the public hearing. In the event that no determination
is made within 62 days and the applicant has not waived the
time requirements, the application shall be deemed approved. The
Board shall include such conditions of approval as were required
and in addition:
(a) The Planning Board shall require that on- or off-site
improvements be installed, including, but not limited to, on- or
off-site drainage systems to ensure that all drainage, storm
runoff and subsurface waters are carried into approved
watercourses and drainage systems shown on the Official Map.
The Planning Board shall further require that all such off-site
improvements and/or drainage systems be installed on
property granted to the Village by fee, easement or otherwise,
as determined by the Planning Board.
(b) No certificate of occupancy or use shall be issued for the site
until all the improvement shown on the site development plan,
including off-site requirements required by the site
development plan, have been duly installed and all easements
and property interests granted or dedicated to the Village.
(c) 211The site shall be developed in strict conformity with the
approved site development plan, except as provided for below.
When the approval of a change based on unexpected or
unanticipated conditions is requested of the Building Inspector
or other appropriate Village agency, such request shall be
submitted to the appropriate inspecting agency in writing. No
field change shall be valid unless a copy of the requested
change is filed with the Planning Board, with the approval of
the appropriate agency noted thereon or appended thereto,
within five days of such approval. Such change shall be deemed
acceptable if not acted upon by the Planning Board within 62
days.
H. Reservation of parkland on site plans containing residential units.
(1) Before such authorized board may approve a site plan containing
residential units, such site plan shall also show, when required by
such board, a park or parks suitably located for playground or
other recreational purposes.
211. Editor's Note: Former Subsection G(2)(c), regarding partial certificates of occupancy, was
repealed 8-2-2011 by L.L. No. 3-2011. This local law also redesignated former Subsection
G(2)(d) as G(2)(c).
§ 270-52 OSSINING CODE § 270-52
C:992
(2) Land for park, playground or other recreational purposes may not
be required until the authorized board has made a finding that a
proper case exists for requiring that a park or parks be suitably
located for playgrounds or other recreational purposes within the
Village. Such findings shall include an evaluation of the present and
anticipated future needs for park and recreational facilities in the
Village based on projected population growth to which the
particular site plan will contribute.
(3) In the event the authorized board makes a finding pursuant to
Subsection H(2) that the proposed site plan presents a proper case
for requiring a park or parks suitably located for playgrounds or
other recreational purposes, but that a suitable park or parks of
adequate size to meet the requirements cannot be properly located
on such site plan, the authorized board may require a sum of money
in lieu thereof to be established by the Village Board of Trustees or
alternatively, land and/or improvements may be provided off site at
another location mutually agreeable to the developer and the
Village. The amount of land and/or improvements shall be equal in
value to money offered in lieu thereof and in accordance with the
schedule set forth herein. In making such determination of
suitability, the board shall assess the size and suitability of lands
shown on the site plan which could be possible locations for park or
recreational facilities, as well as practical factors including
whether there is a need for additional facilities in the immediate
neighborhood. Any monies required by the authorized board in lieu
of land for park, playground or other recreational purposes,
pursuant to the provisions of this section, shall be deposited into a
trust fund to be used by the Village exclusively for park, playground
or other recreational purposes, including the acquisition of
property.
(4) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this subsection, if the
land included in a site plan under review is a portion of a
subdivision plat which has been reviewed and approved, the
authorized board shall credit the applicant for any land set aside or
money donated in lieu thereof under such subdivision plat
approval. In the event of resubdivision of such plat, nothing shall
preclude the additional reservation of parkland or money donated
in lieu thereof.
I. Performance bond. A performance bond may be required by the
Planning Board to be posted by the applicant to guarantee to the Village
that he or she will faithfully construct, or cause to be constructed, the
required public improvements and utilities which were an integral part
of his or her approved site plan; and further, that the construction shall
be complete within a reasonable period of time. The performance bond
will be prepared by the Village Engineer. Performance bond amount,
completion schedule, public improvements covered, inspection and
bond approval must be received before issuance of a building permit.
§ 270-52 CHARTER § 270-52
C:993
J. Signing and referral of plan. Upon submission of the final site
development plan with modifications required by the Planning Board in
its final approval and upon satisfaction of any conditions imposed by
such approval, the Chairperson of the Planning Board shall sign the
approved site development plan and file one copy with the Building
Inspector, who may thereafter issue a building permit, certificate of
occupancy and certificate of use in reliance thereon, in accordance with
Article VII.
K. Amendment of plan. An application for an amendment of any approved
site development plan for a site which has received prior final site
development plan approval shall be processed in accordance with the
preceding provisions. However, only those site development plan
elements proposed to be modified or changed need be presented,
except where such modifications or changes have a material and
substantial impact on the balance of the site development plan and
functioning of the site. Any change constituting an overall site plan
change of more than 10%, as determined by the Planning Board, will
require a new site plan submission. The applicant's licensed design
professional shall submit a letter, and a drawing when necessary,
indicating the scope of the proposed change no later than 20 days
before a Planning Board meeting for a determination by the Planning
Board as to whether the proposed amendment shall require a public
hearing. Fees for an amended site development plan approval shall be
in accordance with the Standard Schedule of Fees of the Village of
Ossining.212
L. Approval of a site development plan shall be valid for one year from the
date thereof for the purpose of obtaining a building permit. Failure to
secure a building permit during this time period shall cause the site
plan approval to become null and void. Upon the request of the
applicant, the Planning Board may grant an extension for a period not
to exceed one year. There shall be up to two extensions that may be
granted, for a total time period of all the extensions, taken together, of
no more than two years.
M. Maintenance. It shall be the duty of every property owner to maintain
his/her property in conformity with the approved site development plan.
Failure to do so may constitute a violation of this chapter, resulting in
civil or criminal penalties, forfeiture of bonds, suspension of
consideration of all applications before the Planning Board relating to
the same property and other remedies deemed necessary by the
appropriate authorities.
N. Appeal. Any person aggrieved by any decision of the Planning Board
hereunder may, within 30 days of the filing of the decision in the office
of the Village Clerk, seek judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the
New York State Civil Practice Law and Rules.

§ 270-53. General provisions.
§ 270-54. Application procedure.
A. Pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Home Rule Law, the Village
Board reserves the approval authority for special permits for certain
uses identified in Article III of this chapter. Such uses represent such
diverse benefits and impacts on local land uses as to preclude specific
descriptions and standards for their approval. The Village board, in
considering any application for a special permit hereunder, shall
exercise such discretion reserved for legislative matters so as to ensure
that the public health, welfare and safety are protected and the
environmental and land resources of the Village are most efficiently
utilized.
B. Applications for special permits pursuant to this article shall be upon
forms prescribed by the Village Board and shall contain the information
required in the rules and regulations adopted pursuant to this chapter.
C. Fees for special permit applications and for appeals before the Village
Board shall be in accordance with the Standard Schedule of Fees of the
Village.213
A. An applicant for a special permit shall, simultaneously with the filing of
an application with the Village Board, file an application for site
development plan approval with the Planning Board, together with
appropriate plans, drawings and fee for site development plan review.
Thereafter, and before the Village Board shall give any consideration to
review the application for such special permit, the Planning Board shall
review the application for the purpose of preliminary site development
plan review and in light of the general considerations herein and
specific standards herein for special permits. Thereafter, the Planning
Board shall transmit its recommendations to the Village Board within
90 days of the receipt of a complete application for site development
plan.
B. The Village Board, upon receipt of the report by the Planning Board,
shall, within 62 days of such receipt, conduct a public hearing and,
within 62 days thereafter, render its decision, unless the applicant
waives the time requirements of this section.
C. The Village Board, in approving any special permit thereunder, shall
require conformance to any supplementary requirements applying to
such uses generally and may establish such other conditions or
limitations upon the use, or characteristics of the use, which are

seek judicial review pursuant to Article 78 of the New York State Civil
Practice Law and Rules.
reasonably related to the public health, safety and general welfare and
as may be necessary to carry out the intent of this chapter.
D. The decision of the Village Board shall be filed in the office of the
Village Clerk and a copy thereof mailed to the applicant. Thereafter, the
applicant will proceed with site development plan approval before the
Planning Board.

requirement or conditions of such special permit shall be subject to
appeal before the Zoning Board of Appeals.
F. Requirements or conditions imposed by this chapter for any special
permit use shall not be waived or reduced by the Village Board and
shall be considered to be the minimum requirements for any
authorization hereunder, except that the Village Board may authorize
further application and action by the Zoning Board of Appeals. Special
permits shall be deemed to be indefinite authorization, unless
otherwise specified in the approval thereof, but in any case shall expire
within 18 months of the date of approval, unless a building permit has
been issued for the special permit use. Such period may be extended on
separate application to the Village Board.
G. The grant of special permits for the uses indicated may be conditioned
on periodic renewal, which renewal shall be granted following
application, public notice and hearing, and may be withheld upon
determination that conditions as may have been identified in the
original grant requiring that the use be of temporary duration now
necessitate cessation of such use or imposition of additional or
supplemental safeguards or conditions or that the original conditions as
may have been prescribed for such special permit have not been or are
not being complied with, wholly or in part. Notices of violation shall be
prima facie evidence of lack of conformity to such standards or
conditions.
H. Notice to applicant and county planning board or agency or regional
planning council. At least 10 days before such hearing, the authorized
board shall mail notices thereof to the applicant and to the county
planning board or agency or regional planning council, as required by

Law, which notice shall be accompanied by a full statement of the
matter under consideration, as defined in Subdivision 1 of § 239-m of

ARTICLE XII
Board of Architectural Review
§ 270-56. Findings; purpose.
The Board of Trustees hereby finds that excessive uniformity, dissimilarity,
inappropriateness or poor quality of design in the exterior appearance of
buildings erected in any neighborhood adversely affects the desirability of
the immediate area and neighboring areas for residential, business or other
purposes and by so doing, impairs the benefits of occupancy of existing
property in such areas; impairs the stability and value of both improved
and unimproved real property in such areas; prevents the most appropriate
development and use of such areas; contributes to the degeneration of
property in such areas with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting
the health, safety and general welfare of the community; and contributes to
the diminution of the taxable value of real property in such areas and its
ability to support the municipal services provided therefor. It is the purpose
of this article to prevent these and other harmful effects of such exterior
appearance of buildings erected or altered in any neighborhood and thus to
promote the health, safety and general welfare of the community, conserve
the value of buildings and encourage the most appropriate use of land
within the Village of Ossining.
§ 270-57. Creation, appointment and organization.
§ 270-58. Powers and duties.
A. There is hereby created a Board of Architectural Review which shall
consist of each member of the Planning Board who shall serve without
compensation. The terms of each member shall run concurrently with
his corresponding time on the Planning Board, and appointments of
new members shall be automatic as new members are appointed to the
Planning Board.
B. The Chairman and Secretary of the Board of Architectural Review shall
be the same Chairman and Secretary serving on the Planning Board.
The Board of Architectural Review shall meet concurrently as does the
Planning Board. Special meetings, as required, may be held by the
Board at its discretion. All minutes, records, decisions or other official
actions will be recorded as part of the Planning Board's records under
the heading of architectural review and shall be filed with the Village
Clerk and become a public record.
A. In all cases where site plan approval is required, as stated in other
sections of this chapter, the review by the Board of Architectural
Review for similarity, dissimilarity or inappropriateness shall be given
concurrently or prior to the Planning Board's review for site plan
approval. In all cases where site plan approval is not required by the
Planning Board, such as for one- and two-family residences not part of a
proposed subdivision, separate application shall be made to the Board
§ 270-56 CHARTER § 270-58
C:997
of Architectural Review, and approval is required prior to the issuance
of a building permit. In addition to any notice as may be required
by law, the Board of Architectural Review shall cause notice of such
application to be mailed at least 10 days before the date scheduled for
the review of such application by the Board to all owners of property
which lies within 300 feet of any boundary line of the property which is
the subject matter of the application and to such other owners as the
Board of Architectural Review may deem advisable. The names of said
owners shall be taken as they appear on the last completed tax roll of
the Village. Provided that due notice shall have been given as otherwise
required by law and that there shall have been substantial compliance
with the remaining provisions of this section, the failure to give notice
in exact conformance herewith shall not be deemed to invalidate action
taken by the Board of Architectural Review in connection with such
application.
B. The Building Inspector shall promptly refer to the Board of
Architectural Review every application for a building permit. Such
Board may approve, or conditionally approve, subject to specified
modifications, or disapprove any application for a building permit,
provided that such Board finds the structure or building, if erected or
altered as proposed in the application for building permit, would be so
detrimental to the desirability, property values or development of the
surrounding areas as to be the cause of one of the harmful effects set
forth in § 270-56 hereof by reason of:
(1) Excessive similarity to any other existing structure or for which a
permit has been issued or to any other structure included in the
same permit application, facing upon the same or intersecting
street and within 500 feet of the proposed site as measured along
center lines of streets in a Single-Family Residence District, and
within 250 feet of the proposed site in any district other than a
Single-Family Residence District, with respect to one or more of the
following features:
(a) Apparently identical front or side elevations;
(b) Substantially identical size and arrangement of either doors,
windows, porticoes or other openings or breaks in the
elevation facing the street, including reverse arrangement; or
(c) Other significant identical features of design, such as, but not
limited to, materials, rooflines and height or other design
elements.
(2) Excessive dissimilarity in relation to any other existing structures,
or for which a permit has been issued, or to any other structures
included in the same permit application, facing upon the same or
intersecting street and within 500 feet of the proposed site as
measured along center lines of streets in a Single-Family Residence
District, and within 250 feet of the proposed site in any district
§ 270-58 OSSINING CODE § 270-58
C:998
other than a Single-Family Residence District, in respect to one
or more of the following features, provided that the finding is not
based on personal preference as to taste or choice of architectural
style:
(a) Cubicle contents.
(b) Gross floor area.
(c) Height of building or height of roof.
(d) Other significant design features, such as types of materials
used, the durability of materials and the texture of the
buildings.
(3) Inappropriateness in relation to the established character of other
structures in the immediate area or neighboring areas with respect
to significant design features, such as material or quality of
architectural design, provided that the Board shall find that the
inappropriateness which exists is of such a nature as to be
reasonably expected to be the cause of one or more of the harmful
effects set forth in § 270-56 hereof and that the finding is not based
on personal preference as to taste or choice of architectural style.
(4) The Building Inspector shall refuse any building permit application
which is disapproved as provided in this section. If the Board of
Architectural Review shall fail to disapprove, or conditionally
approve, subject to specified modifications, any such application
referred to it within 45 days of the receipt of a complete application
if such Board shall approve any such application, the Building
Inspector shall forthwith issue the building permit, provided that it
conforms in all respects to all other applicable laws and
regulations.

§ 270-59. Procedure for amending chapter.
This chapter, or any part thereof, may be amended, supplemented or
repealed from time to time by the Village Board on its own motion or
upon recommendation by the Planning Board. Prior to the public hearing
specified in Subsection C, every proposed amendment shall be referred by
the Village Board to the Planning Board for a report which shall be rendered
within 62 days of such referral.
A. Report of the Planning Board. In making such report on a proposed
amendment, the Planning Board shall make inquiry and determination
concerning the items specified below:
(1) Concerning a proposed amendment to or change in the text of this
chapter:

Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 270-60. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be the minimum requirements adopted for the promotion of the
public health and safety, specifically provided to the contrary that it is not
intended by this chapter to repeal, abrogate, annul or in any way to impair
or interfere with any rules, regulations or permits previously adopted or
issued or which shall be adopted or issued pursuant to law relating to the
use of buildings, structures, shelters or premises, nor is it intended by this
chapter to interfere with or abrogate or annul any easements, covenants
or other agreements between parties; provided, however, that where this
chapter imposes a greater restriction upon the use of a building or premises
or requires larger open spaces than are imposed or required by any other
statute, law, rule, regulation or permit or by any easement or agreement,
the provisions of this chapter shall control.
§ 270-61. Applicability.

immediately prior to the effective date of Local Law No. 4-2009.
(2) All other subdivision applications shall be governed by the 2009
Zoning Law of the Village of Ossining, New York, and the Village's

time.
B. Special permit, conditional use permit, site plan and zoning variance
applications.
(1) Special permit, conditional use permit, site plan and zoning

not to exceed one year. There shall be no limit to the number of
extensions that may be granted, but the total time period of all
