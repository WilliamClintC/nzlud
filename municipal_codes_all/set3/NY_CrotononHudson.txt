adopted at a regular meeting, provide for the reimbursement of the owner
of lands or permanent easements for lands dedicated to the village, together
with sewers, water mains, fire hydrants or other such improvements
situated therein or in village streets, and constructed at private expense
for the cost of construction of such sewers, water mains, fire hydrants and
improvements in such dedicated lands or permanent easements at the joint
expense of the village and of the property benefited or for a portion of such
cost at the expense of the property benefited, with the remainder to be

or partly by such owner and partly by the village; provided, however, that
the rate of assessment of the portion assessed to the property benefited

the last three prior sewer construction jobs for which bonds were issued
by the village and the cost borne partly at the expense of the village and

VISUAL ENVIRONMENT ADVISORY BOARD
GENERAL REFERENCES
Code of Ethics  See Ch. 20. Residence requirement  See Ch. 50.
§ 60-1. Legislative intent.
The Board of Trustees finds that the economy and quality of life of the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson are affected by its visual environment. The
general welfare of residents and of property owners, as well as property
values and the tax base, are enhanced by natural and man-made features
and structures of visual or historic value. They are, conversely, depressed by
buildings, streets, neighborhoods, municipal works, public spaces and land
developments of unattractive or inappropriate appearance. It is the purpose
of this chapter to safeguard the beneficial effects of such existing natural
and man-made features and structures and to prevent the harmful effects
of future unattractive or inappropriate projects and thus to promote and
protect the economy, quality of life and general welfare of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson.
§ 60-2. Creation; membership; terms; officers.
A. To carry out the purpose of this chapter, there is hereby created an
Advisory Board on the Visual Environment, hereinafter called the
"Board" consisting of five members appointed by the Mayor. The
members shall serve without compensation. Except as provided
elsewhere in this Code, all members of the Board shall be village
residents18 and shall be qualified by reason of training or experience in
architecture, community planning, landscape architecture, real estate
or other relevant activity or by reason of civic interest and sound
judgment. Insofar as suitably qualified people can be found within the
village, the Board shall include an architect, a landscape architect, a
community planner and a person with experience in village
government.19
B. Of the persons first appointed, one shall serve until the start of the next
official year of the village, two until the start of the second ensuing
official year and two until the start of the third ensuing official year.
Thereafter, each person shall serve for a term of three years. Vacancies
shall be filled by the Mayor for the unexpired term of any member
whose place has become vacant.

§ 60-3. Functions.
C. The Board shall choose its Chairperson from among the members and
shall have full power to make rules and regulations concerning the
conduct of its meetings, the processing of referrals and the issuing of
reports.
A. The Board shall be available in an advisory capacity to the Board of
Trustees, the Planning Board, the Board of Appeals and the Village
Engineer for all projects and proposals under consideration by these
bodies, in order to review those aspects of such projects and proposals
which affect the visual environment of the village.
B. The Planning Board shall make available to the Board all site
development plans submitted to it. The Board of Trustees shall make
available to the Board for its advisory report available information on
municipal projects. The Planning Board or the Board of Trustees as the
case may be, shall establish procedures so as to be able to provide the
Board with one copy of the plans or relevant portions thereof, for all
such site developments or municipal projects.
C. The Board of Trustees shall also make available to the Board
information on other municipal projects affecting the visual
environment, including but not limited to the demolition or exterior
alteration of existing municipal buildings and other structures, the
clearing or landscaping of land, the layout and the appearance of
streets and the choice of equipment and apparatus to be used out of
doors.
D. The Board shall advise the Board of Trustees and Planning Board on
proposals for changes in the Master Plan, the Zoning Map and the
zoning of specific plots of lands and may itself develop and propose
such changes.
E. The Board shall identify and prepare a list describing natural and
manmade features and structures within the village which enhance the
visual environment and whose preservation should be a purpose of
village policy. Such list shall be filed by the Board with the Board of
Trustees and with the Planning Board and shall be reviewed at least
once every two years.
F. The Board may issue reports concerning and recommend programs and
legislation to preserve or improve the visual environment, including but
not limited to the appearance of buildings, neighborhoods, commercial
areas, vacant land, plazas, playgrounds, streets and thoroughfares, and
assist in the identification of funding sources and in the securing of
funding for such programs.
G. The Board may initiate and support educational and informational
activities to develop public awareness of visual environmental values.

PUBLIC OFFICER INDEMNIFICATION
§ 61-1. Legislative purpose.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson has heretofore
recognized the increasing litigation exposure faced by public employees and
officers and conferred the defense and indemnification benefits contained
in § 18 of the Public Officers Law on the village's public officials and
employees by resolution. The Board of Trustees wishes to reaffirm and
codify that action and to provide additional indemnification and defense
protection pursuant to law.
§ 61-2. Section 18 benefits.
The full benefits of § 18 of the Public Officers Law shall apply to public
officials and employees of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson, and the Village
of Croton-on-Hudson shall be held liable for the costs incurred under the
provisions of that section, as well as the costs incurred under § 61-3 of this
chapter.
§ 61-3. Additional indemnification.
The village will provide for the defense of any village officer or employee
in any civil action or proceeding arising out of any alleged act or omission
H. The Board shall not be required to render an advisory report on all
matters referred to it but shall be empowered to decide which such
matters may, in its discretion, affect the visual environment and are,
therefore, appropriate for its consideration.
A. The Board shall render its advisory report upon referrals which it
deems appropriate for its consideration as promptly as feasible, but no
other village body or board shall be required to withhold any official
determination or action because the Board has not yet rendered a
report. The Board shall maintain liaison with the Board of Trustees, the
Planning Board, the Board of Appeals and the Village Engineer in order
to permit coordination in the processing of projects and proposals
which may affect the visual environment of the village.
B. The Chairperson of the Board or any other member delegated by the
Board shall have the right to present the views of the Board at any
public hearing of the Board of Trustees, the Planning Board or the
Board of Appeals.
C. The Board shall report annually to the Board of Trustees on the state of
the visual environment of the village and make such recommendations
as it deems advisable.
§ 60-3 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 61-3

in which it is alleged that the officer or employee has violated the civil
rights of the claimant, petitioner or plaintiff under §§ 1981 and 1983 of the
U.S. Civil Rights Act. The village shall indemnify and save harmless such
officer or employee in the amount of any judgment or settlement of claim
obtained against such officer or employee, including punitive and exemplary
damages. Such legal defense and indemnification shall be provided only
where the officer or employee at the time of such alleged act or omission
was acting in good faith and within the scope of his public employment,
powers or duties. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to
any other statute, local law or enactment providing legal defense and
indemnification in civil actions brought against such officer or employee.

ADULT ENTERTAINMENT USE BUSINESSES
§ 66-1. Findings and purpose.
A. Some business uses, because of their very nature, are recognized as
having serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly
when several of them are concentrated, thereby having a deleterious
effect upon the use and enjoyment of adjacent areas. Special regulation
of these business uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects
will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhood. The primary purpose of this chapter is to restrict adult
entertainment uses to nonresidential and noncommercial areas of the
village and to prevent an undue concentration of these uses.
B. The unrestrained proliferation and inappropriate location of such
businesses is inconsistent with existing development and future plans
for the Village of Croton-on-Hudson in that they often result in
influences on the community which increase the crime rate and
undermine the economic, moral and social welfare of the community.
The deleterious effects of these businesses change the economic, social
and moral character of the existing community and adversely affect
existing businesses and community and family life. Of particular
concern is the location of these uses in areas where our youth may
regularly assemble. As other business activity drops off and the quality
of life deteriorates, merchants and families move away from the area,
leaving it in a vacant and depressed state.
C. Adult entertainment use businesses exhibit the characteristics noted
above. Special regulation of adult entertainment businesses is
necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods or land
uses. In order to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
such businesses and to ensure that those effects will not adversely
effect the health, safety and economic well-being of the community, the

work in accordance with the application, plans and specifications on
which it is based for a period of six months after the date of its issuance.
For good cause shown, and provided that there shall have been no

herein provided, 1/2 of the fee paid for such permit, not including any
special fee covering examination of plans of a structure of complex
design, may be refunded to the person who obtained the permit,
provided that no work has been commenced and an application for
refund is made within the six- or eight-month period, but in no case

shall be valid insofar as it authorized the performance of work or the
use of materials which are not in accordance with the requirements of
the applicable building regulations and village ordinances.

Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program
[Adopted 7-13-2015 by L.L. No. 5-2015]
§ 114-10. Legislative findings; intent and purpose; authority.
A. It is the policy of both the Village of Croton-on-Hudson and the State of
New York to reduce costs and provide cost certainty for the purpose of
economic development, to promote deeper penetration of energy
efficiency and renewable energy resources such as wind and solar, and
wider deployment of distributed energy resources as well as to examine
the retail energy markets and increase participation of and benefits for
residential and small commercial customers in those markets. Among
the policies and models that may offer benefits in New York is
community choice aggregation, which allows local governments to
determine the default supplier of electricity and natural gas on behalf of
its residential and small commercial customers.
B. The purpose of this CCA Program is to allow participating local
governments, including the Village of Croton-on-Hudson, to procure
energy supply service for their residential and small commercial
customers, who will have the opportunity to opt out of the procurement,
while maintaining transmission and distribution service from the
existing distribution utility. This article establishes a program that will
allow the Village of Croton-on-Hudson to put out for bid the total
amount of natural gas and/or electricity being purchased by local
residential and small commercial customers. bundled customers will
have the opportunity to have more control to lower their overall energy
costs, to spur clean energy innovation and investment, to improve
customer choice and value, and to protect the environment; thereby,
fulfilling the purposes of this article and fulfilling an important public
purpose.
C. The Village of Croton-on-Hudson is authorized to implement this
Community Choice Aggregation (Energy) Program pursuant to Section
10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New York Municipal Home Rule Law; and State of
New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0564, Petition of
Sustainable Westchester for Expedited Approval for the
Implementation of a Pilot Community Choice Aggregation Program
within the County of Westchester, Order Granting Petition in Part
(issued February 26, 2015) as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0564 (collectively, the "Order"). Order shall
also mean orders of the Public Service Commission related to State of
New York Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding
on Motion of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation
Programs (issued December 15, 2014) to the extent that orders related
to Case No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the Village not otherwise
permitted pursuant to orders related to Case 14-M-0564; provided,
however, that in the event of any conflict between orders from Case No.

§ 114-15. Verification and reporting.
A. The Village or in conjunction with the ESCO will notify its residential
and small commercial customers, by letter notice, of the Village's
decision to establish the CCA Program, of the contract terms with an
ESCO, and of the opportunity to opt out of the CCA Program.
B. The letter notice will be sent to each customer at the address provided
by the distribution utility and explain the CCA Program and the
material provisions of the ESCO contract, identify the methods by
which the customer can opt out of the CCA Program, and provide
information on how the customer can access additional information
about the CCA Program.
C. The opt-out period shall be twenty (20) days.
D. CCA Program bundled customers, upon enrollment, will receive a
welcome letter that will explain the customers' options for canceling
the enrollment if they believe they were enrolled incorrectly or
otherwise decide to withdraw from the CCA Program in favor of another
Supplier. The welcome letter also will explain that residential
customers are entitled to the added protection of the mandated threeday
rescission period as detailed in Section 5(B)(3) of the Uniform
Business Practices.
A. Sustainable Westchester shall be responsible for filing an annual report
with the Public Service Commission, which identifies the number of

§ 115-2. Environmental Compliance Consultant.
A. The Village Board has been advised by the Village Engineer, Village
Counsel and the Village Planning Board that the costs of ensuring
compliance with applicable environmental standards and requirements
regarding residential development, subdivision development, cluster
development, commercial development, industrial development and
any other development or construction activity in environmentally
sensitive areas exceed the resources presently available to the Village.
B. Increasingly, the Planning Board is approving subdivision and cluster
developments which are subject to complex and detailed conditions in
order to properly protect environmentally sensitive areas. The Village
will be required to closely monitor construction and development on
such sites in order to ensure full compliance with these detailed
conditions and to prevent, to the maximum extent possible,
environmental harm.
C. Construction in environmentally sensitive areas may result in
irreparable damage to the environment if prompt action is not taken by
Village officials.
D. The Village Board of Trustees desires to allow development wherever
practical, reasonable and in conformity with all applicable laws, rules
and regulations and to concurrently assure that environmentally
sensitive areas are actually developed in full compliance with all
applicable Village requirements relating to environmental protection
and all applicable specific resolutions or other development approvals
of any of the various Village boards.
A. Upon the recommendation of the approving authority issuing a
subdivision, site plan, minor site plan, special permit or environmental
constraints (wetlands, steep slopes or tree removal) permit approval,

forms of financial security as may be required under the Village
Code or any applicable permit resolution.
B. Issuance of a stop-work order by the Village Engineer shall be as
provided in § 86-14 of the Village Code. A stop-work order may be
appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the Planning Board
not later than 30 days after service of the stop-work order upon the
applicant. A hearing shall be scheduled by the Planning Board within 20
days of receipt of request for a hearing. After the close of the hearing,
the Planning Board may confirm, modify or cancel the stop-work order.
C. Stop-work orders shall remain in force permanently unless rescinded by
the Village Engineer or by the Planning Board after an appeal.
D. The Village shall be empowered to enforce the requirements of any
development or construction approval, site plan or stop-work order by
means of any judicial remedy available to the Village, including but not
limited to injunctive relief.

a depth greater than four feet shall be properly guarded and protected
during construction by a substantial fence of proper height and
strength, with gates, which gates shall be locked at all times when the
property is not being worked. In addition, when deemed appropriate by
the approving authority, a permanent substantial safety fence of proper
height and strength shall be installed to properly guard and protect said
changes in grade after construction.
B. Excavation and filling operations shall be conducted so as to not
adversely impact stormwater drainage, water bodies and/or
watercourses, except as may be otherwise authorized by Chapter 196
or by wetlands permit issued pursuant to Chapter 227 of the Village
Code.
C. During construction all excavations shall be drained so that any
standing water at the bottom of any excavation shall not be greater in
depth than one foot, and after construction there shall be no standing
water at the bottom of any excavations.
D. All fill shall be clean, containing no garbage, refuse or deleterious
matter, shall be graded in a smooth transition to the level of the
adjoining property and shall be reseeded with an appropriate
vegetation mixture sufficient to stabilize the soil. The approving
authority may require testing to determine the cleanliness of the fill.
E. In the case of a permit for the removal of topsoil, at least two inches of
topsoil shall be left upon the surface from which topsoil has been
removed, and the area from which said topsoil has been taken shall be
reseeded with an appropriate vegetation mixture sufficient to stabilize
the soil and covered with mulch.
F. The on-site processing of fill or the erection or use of any structure for
such processing, such as but not limited to hoppers, strainers, washers,
crushers or sheds, is prohibited; however, where a permit has been

the soil or other material involved, and the exposed slopes shall be
required to be seeded or protected by other means to prevent their
subsequent erosion. In the event of any dispute as to the stability of the
slopes, the determination of the approving authority shall be
conclusive.

shall the excavation or filling operation divert or cause water to collect
on the property of others or interfere with or overload any existing or
planned drainage facilities of the Village, endanger any road, street or
highway within the limits in the Village or produce or enlarge areas
from which water will not drain, and provision shall be made for the
temporary drainage of the property during the excavation or filling
operation and for the restoration of permanent drainage to be effective
upon completion of the operation.
L. The approving authority shall take into consideration the declared
policy of this chapter regarding the replacement of topsoil and the
restoration, reseeding and stabilization of the land.

permanent supports have been provided for the sides of such
excavation, any person causing any excavation to be made shall provide
such sheet piling and bracing as may be necessary. Whenever

opportunity to be heard, may revoke or suspend an excavation and
filling permit if it finds that the applicant has not complied with any or
all of the terms of such permit, has exceeded the authority granted in

permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 129-11. Purpose of floodplain development permit; fees.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 129-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include but not be limited to plans, in duplicate,
drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee as set from time to time by
resolution of the Village Board of Trustees. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village of Croton-on-Hudson
for any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of
§ 129-8 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 129-11

or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 129-15C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 129-17, Nonresidential structures (except coastal highhazard
areas).
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 129-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.

including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of §§ 129-14 through 129-18 and, in
particular, § 129-14A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§§ 129-14 through 129-18, no permit shall be issued. The applicant
may revise the application to include measures that mitigate or
eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 129-12G, as criteria for requiring that new
construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.

elevation data is available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by the same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.

size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, provided that the items in
§ 129-19D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met.
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause.
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant.
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or
extraordinary public expense; create nuisances; cause fraud on or
victimization of the public; or conflict with existing chapters or
ordinances.

Code Enforcement Officer, Chief of Police or the designee of either of them,

of the filming and shall be a condition of the permit. Any adjustment

likely in said sewer and other pertinent facts. Minute quantities of a waste
which would be objectionable in larger quantity may be accepted if
sufficiently diluted when and as discharged or if the quantity discharged is
small as compared with the flow in the receiving sewer, but any permission
to discharge minute quantities of an otherwise excluded waste shall be
revocable at any time by the village.
§ 191-21. Pretreatment sampling facilities, inspections.
§ 191-22. Restrictions on use of storm sewers.
No wastewaters or substances which are excluded from sanitary sewers
shall be discharged into any storm sewer.

The purpose of this article is to establish a separate sanitary sewer rent
fund and impose sanitary sewer rents in the Village of Croton-on-Hudson
in accordance with Article 14-F of the General Municipal Law, to ensure
a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs, and to use
the sewer rents as the principal source of revenue for the operation and
maintenance of the sanitary sewer system.
§ 191-27. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
OWNER  The owner of the premises, a mortgagee or vendee in
possession, assignee of rents, receiver, executor, trustee, lessee or other
person, firm or corporation in control of a building or premises.
PREMISES  A lot, plot or parcel of land, including any building or
structure.
SANITARY SEWER SYSTEM  All sewer pipes and other appurtenances
that are used or useful in whole or in part in connection with the collection,
treatment, or disposal of sewage, industrial waste, and other wastes, that
are owned, operated or maintained by the Village of Croton-on-Hudson and
that connect to the Ossining sanitary sewage treatment facility or are within
the Ossining Sanitary Sewer District.
VILLAGE  The Village of Croton-on-Hudson, New York.
§ 191-28. Establishment of sanitary sewer rents.
The owner of all premises within the Croton portion of the Ossining Sanitary
Sewer District or using the sanitary sewer system or any part thereof shall
be required to pay sanitary sewer rents for the payment of the costs of
operating, maintaining, repairing, and replacing the sanitary sewer system.
§ 191-29. Determination of costs.
In April of each year, the Village of Croton-on-Hudson shall determine the
total annual costs of operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewer
system that are necessary to maintain the capacity and performance during
the life of the sanitary sewer system for which such works were designed
and constructed. The total annual costs of operation and maintenance shall
include, but need not be limited to, labor, repairs, replacement, equipment

§ 191-32. Late payments, penalties, liens and collection.
A. All sanitary sewer rents and penalties shall be established by the Board
of Trustees of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson by resolution approved
after a public hearing held on at least five days' notice.
B. For premises that use Village water and are within the Ossining
Sanitary Sewer District or are using the sanitary sewer system, the
sewer rent shall be calculated as a certain percentage of the Village
water bill for those premises. The percentage to be applied shall be the
percentage of the Village's total water bills for premises within the
Croton portion of the Ossining Sanitary Sewer District that is equal to
the annual costs of operation and maintenance of the sanitary sewer
system.
C. For those premises that do not use Village water but are connected to
or served by the sanitary sewer system, the sewer rent shall be a flat fee
based upon the volume of water measured by meter at comparable
premises or, if there are no comparable premises, upon such other
equitable method as the Village deems appropriate.
A. Sanitary sewer rent charges may be obtained at the Village's
administrative offices. The Village Treasurer may mail bills for sewer
rents as an accommodation to the premises owner, but the failure to
mail any such statement, or the failure of the addressee to receive the

charges or the interest imposed for late payment. If the premises owner
does not receive a bill, it is his or her responsibility to contact the
Village Treasurer to obtain one.
B. Sanitary sewer rent bills shall cover the same billing period as covered
by the Village water bill. For premises that do not use Village water,

Treasurer.
A. Penalties for nonpayment of sewer rent charges. The following
penalties are prescribed for failure to pay sewer rent charges:
(1) No penalty shall be assessed if sewer rent charges are paid within
30 days from the period ending date of the bill.

fund." All such funds, together with the interest thereon, shall be used in
accordance with General Municipal Law § 453.
§ 191-34. Consistency with General Municipal Law.
This article shall be construed in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Article 14-F of the General Municipal Law.
§ 191-35. Severability.
If any provision of this article or its application to any person or
circumstance is adjudged invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, such
judgment shall not affect or impair the validity of the other provisions of this
article or its application thereof to other persons and circumstances.
(2) If the sewer rent charge is not paid within 30 days from the periodending
date of the bill, a penalty of 5% of the account due shall be
assessed, and a further penalty of 1% shall be added for each
succeeding month or any portion of a month in which the sewer
rents are not paid. The Village Treasurer shall cause, on the next
succeeding April 15, any unpaid sewer rents charges and penalties
in excess of 60 days to be added to the Village tax bills.
B. In accordance with General Municipal Law § 452, sanitary sewer rents
shall constitute a lien upon the premises served by the sanitary sewer
system. This lien shall have priority and be senior to every other lien
with the exception of the lien of an existing tax, assessment, or other
lawful charge imposed by the state or of a political subdivision or
district thereof.
C. Delinquent accounts, including sanitary sewer rents and penalties,
shall be collected in a manner provided for in General Municipal Law
§ 452, Subsection 4.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 195-1. Legislative findings.
The Village Board of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson finds and declares
it to be the public policy of the Village to preserve, protect and conserve
its steep slopes so as to maintain and protect the natural terrain and its
vegetative features, preserve wetlands, water bodies and watercourses,
prevent flooding, protect important scenic views and vistas, preserve areas
of wildlife habitat, provide safe building sites and protect adjoining property
by preventing surface erosion, creep and sudden slope failure. In this
connection, the Village Board finds as follows:
A. Protection of steep slopes is a matter of concern to the entire Village.
The establishment of regulatory and conservation practices to prevent
disturbance of steep slopes is needed to protect the public health,
safety and general welfare. Experience has demonstrated a need for
effective protection of steep slopes, including careful review and
regulation and the implementation of stringent mitigation measures
where, in the opinion of the approving authority, no practicable
alternative to such disturbance exists. However, in all cases where the
approving authority determines that total avoidance of steep slopes is
not practicable, such disturbance should constitute the minimum
disturbance necessary to ensure the property owner a reasonable use
of his property.
B. The improperly managed disturbance of steep slopes can aggravate
erosion and sedimentation beyond rates experienced in natural
geomorphological processes. Erosion and sedimentation often include
the loss of topsoil, a valuable natural resource, and can result in the
disturbance of habitats, degradation of the quality of surface water,
alteration of drainage patterns, the gullying of land, obstruction of
drainage structures and intensification of flooding both on and off the
subject site.
C. The inadequately controlled disturbance of steep slopes can lead to the
failure of slopes and the mass movement of earth, danger to the natural
environment, man-made structures and the safety of persons, and the
degradation of aesthetics.
D. Steep slopes, including vegetation and rock outcroppings located
thereon, are important environmental features that contribute
significantly to the visual impression one forms while traveling through
Croton-on-Hudson. Areas that are highly visible from the roadways are
particularly important in maintaining the Village's semirural character.
Overdevelopment of or improperly managed disturbance to these areas
are detrimental to the visual character of the Village.
E. Regulation of disturbance to steep slopes is consistent with the
legitimate interests of landowners to make reasonable use of their land.
§ 195-1 SEWERS § 195-1
191:233
§ 195-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ANGLE OF REPOSE  The maximum angle at which the exposed face of
various soil and rock materials can deviate from the horizontal without
incurring the likelihood of a slope failure.
APPLICANT  Any individual or individuals, firm, partnership, association,
corporation, company, organization or other legal entity of any kind,
including municipal corporations, governmental agencies or subdivisions
thereof, filing an application pursuant to this chapter.
APPROVING AUTHORITY  The Village agency or public official
empowered to administer the permit procedures of this chapter, as specified
in § 195-5 hereof.
BUILDING INSPECTOR  The Building Inspector of the Village of Crotonon-
Hudson, New York, or his or her authorized representative.
DISTURBANCE  The removal of vegetation, except as specifically
permitted in § 195-3B herein, or the filling, excavation, regrading or
removal of soil, rock or retaining structures in areas of steep slope, whether
by manual labor, machine or explosive. The condition of disturbance will
be deemed to continue until the area of disturbance is revegetated and/or
permanently stabilized.
DISTURBED AREA  Any steep slope area for which a disturbance is
proposed or is ongoing.
PERSON  Any individual or individuals, firm, partnership, association,
corporation, company, organization or other legal entity of any kind,
including municipal corporations, governmental agencies or subdivisions
thereof.
PLANNING BOARD  The Planning Board of the Village of Croton-on-
Hudson.
Regulation can prohibit the degradation of these important
environmental features and allow the reasonable use of private
property by encouraging flexible development design so as to avoid
disturbance of steep slopes. Regulation can also permit
environmentally sound disturbance of steep slopes, conducted in
accordance with acceptable engineering practices, to permit
reasonable use of private property.
F. To mitigate the potential adverse impacts of development on steep
slopes, the approving authority should seek the permanent
preservation of such areas by such means as the use of imaginative and
innovative site design, including the application of § 7-738, Subdivision
review; approval of cluster development, of the New York State Village
Law, and the establishment of conservation easements and other land
preservation techniques.
§ 195-1 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 195-2
191:234
STEEP SLOPE  Any geographical area, whether on a single lot or not,
having a topographical gradient of 15% or greater (ratio of vertical distance
to horizontal distance), with a minimum horizontal dimension of 10 feet,
whether man-made or natural, and whether created by a retaining structure
or not. Steep slopes are further categorized as:
STEEP SLOPE PERMIT  The written form of Village approval granted by
the approving authority and required by this chapter for the issuance of a
work permit and the conduct of any steep slope regulated activity.
VILLAGE ENGINEER  The person employed as a Village Engineer of the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson, or his or her designee.
WORK PERMIT  The written approval issued by the Building Inspector
permitting the actual commencement and continuation of work within a
steep slope regulated area, consistent with the conditions, terms and
requirements of the steep slope permit issued by the approving authority.
MODERATELY STEEP SLOPE  A slope equal to or greater than 15%
but less than 25%.
A.
VERY STEEP SLOPE  A slope equal to or greater than 25% but less
than 35%.
B.
C. EXTREMELY STEEP SLOPE  A slope equal to or greater than 35%.

§ 195-3. Applicability.
A. Regulated activities. Other than an exempt activity as defined in
§ 195-3B hereof, it shall be unlawful to create a new steep slope or
create a disturbance to an existing steep slope in an amount equal to or
greater than the areas described in Subsections A(1) through (4) below
or in an amount equal to or greater than 50% of any existing individual
lot area, in the absence of a steep slope permit issued by the approving
authority and a work permit issued by the Building Inspector.
(1) Steep slope areas.
(a) Moderately steep slope: proposed new steep slope and/or
disturbance covering a minimum horizontal area of 3/10 of an
acre or 13,068 square feet.
(b) Very steep slope: proposed new steep slope and/or disturbance
covering a minimum horizontal area of 2/10 of an acre or 8,712
square feet.
(c) Extremely steep slope: proposed new steep slope and/or
disturbance covering a minimum horizontal area of 1/10 of an
acre or 4,356 square feet.
(2) The most steeply sloped area that meets the minimum area
threshold, as specified above, shall determine approving authority
jurisdiction and review procedures.
(3) If the areas of proposed disturbance within each of the three
categories of steep slope are individually less than the minimum
areas defined above, then the area of all contiguous steeply sloped
areas proposed for disturbance shall be merged as specified herein.
A steep slope area shall be regulated pursuant to the provisions of
this chapter if the total of all such steeply sloped areas proposed for
disturbance, as adjusted according to the weighting factors
identified below, exceeds a sum of 3/10 of an acre or 13,068 square
feet.
Moderately steep slope area X 1.0 + Very steep slope area X 1.5
+ Extremely steep slope area X 3.0 = Total weighted area
(4) If no category of steep slope meets or exceeds the minimum area
requirement for a steep slope, but the total weighted area of two or
more slope categories exceeds 13,068 square feet (3/10 acre), then
the single slope category that has the largest area after the
application of the relevant weighting factor shall determine
approving authority jurisdiction and review procedures.
§ 195-3 SEWERS § 195-3
191:237
§ 195-4. Review standards.
B. Exempt activities. The following activities on steep slopes do not
require the issuance of a permit:
(1) Normal ground maintenance, including mowing, trimming and
pruning of vegetation and removal of dead or diseased vegetation,
provided that such activity does not involve regrading and further
provided that such activity conforms with all other applicable
ordinances, laws and regulations.
(2) The disturbance to steep slopes under temporary emergency
conditions, as determined by the Village Engineer, where such
disturbance is necessary to protect persons or property from
present and imminent danger.
A. In granting a steep slope permit under this chapter, the approving
authority shall apply the following standards:
(1) That the proposed activity and the manner in which it is to be
accomplished are in accordance with the purpose and findings set
forth in § 195-1 of this chapter.
(2) That the proposed activity and the manner in which it is to be
accomplished can be completed without increasing the possibility
of creep or sudden slope failure and will minimize additional
erosion to the maximum extent practicable.
(3) That the proposed activity and the manner in which it is to be
accomplished will not adversely affect the preservation and
protection of existing wetlands, water bodies, watercourses,
floodplains, or any endangered species of flora or fauna.
(4) That the proposed activity and the manner in which it is to be
accomplished can be completed in such a way so as not to
adversely affect existing, proposed or potential future wells or
sewage disposal systems.
(5) That the proposed activity and the manner in which it is to be
accomplished are consistent with the principles and
recommendation of the Village Comprehensive Plan adopted by the
Village Board.
(6) Lot layouts shall be designed so that sanitary sewage disposal
systems entirely avoid areas of very steep slope and extremely
steep slope and are in compliance with all standards and
regulations of the Westchester County Health Department.
(7) The padding or terracing of building sites shall be evaluated on a
site-by-site basis for appropriateness. The mounding of septic tile
fields shall be minimized to the maximum extent practicable.
§ 195-3 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 195-4
191:238
(8) The alignment of roads and driveways shall follow the natural
topography, minimize regrading and, in the case of roads, shall
comply with design standards for maximum grades set forth in the
Village Code.
(9) The natural elevations and vegetative cover of ridgelines shall be
protected from disturbance to the maximum extent possible.
(10) All regrading shall blend in with the natural contours and
undulations of the land.
(11) Cuts and fills shall be rounded off to eliminate sharp angles at the
top, bottom and side of regraded slopes.
(12) The angle of cut and fill slopes shall not exceed the natural angle of
repose of the soil or rock materials in the cut or fill, except where
retaining walls or other structural stabilization is used. Generally
for soils, cut and fill slopes should be not steeper than two
horizontal to one vertical (fifty-percent slope).
(13) Fill slopes shall avoid all slopes of two horizontal to one vertical
(fifty-percent slope) or steeper. The toe of the fill slope shall not be
located within 12 feet horizontally of the top of an existing or
proposed cut slope.
(14) Tops and bottoms of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from
existing and proposed property lines a distance at least equal to the
lesser of three feet plus 1/5 of the height of the cut or fill or 10 feet.
(15) Tops and bottoms of cut and fill slopes shall be set back from
structures a distance that will ensure the safety of the structure in
the event of the collapse of the cut or fill slopes. Generally, such
distance will be considered to be six feet plus 1/5 the height of the
cut or fill but need not exceed 10 feet. Nevertheless, a structure
may be built on a slope or at the toe of a slope if it is designed to
retain the slope and to withstand the forces exerted on it by the
retained slope.
(16) Measures for the control of erosion and sedimentation shall be
undertaken in accordance with the New York Standards and
Specifications for Erosion and Sediment Control (Empire State
Chapter of the Soil and Water Conservation Society, 2005, most
recent version including applicable updates or its successors) or its
equivalent satisfactory to the approving authority.

slopes, soils and environmental sensitivity of the area involved,
the Village Engineer may modify these specified time periods.
(f) Topsoil that will be stripped from all areas of disturbance shall
be stockpiled in a manner so as to minimize erosion and
sedimentation, and shall be replaced on the site at the time of
final grading.
(g) Fill material shall be composed only of nonorganic material,
including rock with a diameter that will allow for appropriate
compaction and cover by topsoil.
(h) Compaction of fill materials in fill areas shall be such that it
ensures support of proposed structures and stabilization for
intended uses.
D. Public hearings.
(1) For any application in which the approving authority is the Village
Engineer, no public hearing will be required. For any application
where the Planning Board is the approving authority, the Planning
Board shall have the option of holding a public hearing.
(2) In all cases where a public hearing will be held on the application
for a steep slope permit, said public hearing will be held no later
than 60 days after the receipt of such complete application. The
approving authority will cause notice of such hearing to be

and 8:00 a.m. The applicant shall indemnify and hold the Village, its officers,
employees and agents harmless against any damage or injury which may
be caused by or arise out of any entry onto the subject site in connection
with the processing of the application or inspection of the site to determine
compliance with any conditions of permit approval during the pendency of
the application, during the effective period of any steep slope permit or
work permit issued for the site and for up to one year after completion of
the work.
§ 195-12. Penalties for offenses.
A. Any person who undertakes any regulated activity without a steep slope
permit required by this chapter or who violates any condition attached
to a steep slope permit or who otherwise violates any provision of this
chapter shall be guilty of an offense, punishable by a fine of not less
than $500 nor more than $1,000. For a second and each subsequent
offense, the violator shall be guilty of an offense punishable by a fine of
not less than $1,000 nor more than $2,000 or a term of imprisonment of
not more than 15 days, or both. Each violation of the provisions of this
chapter shall be a separate and distinct offense and, in the case of a
continuing offense, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a
separate and distinct offense. In addition, any court having jurisdiction
may order or direct a violator to restore the affected steep slope area to
its condition prior to the offense, insofar as that is possible. The court
shall specify a reasonable time for the completion of such restoration,
which shall be effected under the supervision of the Village Engineer.

ARTICLE I
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
§ 196-1. Legislative findings.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 196-2. Purpose and objectives.
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety, and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to
address the legislative findings in § 196-1 hereof. This article seeks to meet
those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species.
C. Clearing, grading, excavating, soil disturbance or placement of fill
during construction tends to increase soil erosion and add to the loss of
native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and aquatic habitat.
D. Improper design, maintenance and construction of stormwater
management practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff,
thereby increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the Village.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.

professional(s) deemed acceptable by the NYSDEC.
C. No land development activity shall cause an increase in turbidity that
will result in substantial visible contrast to natural conditions in surface
waters of the State of New York.
A. The owner, applicant or developer of the land development activity shall
at all times properly operate and maintain all facilities and systems of
treatment and control (and related appurtenances) which are installed
or used by the owner, applicant or developer to achieve compliance
with the conditions of this article. Sediment shall be removed from
sediment traps or sediment ponds whenever their design capacity has
been reduced by 50%, and placed in an acceptable location and
properly stabilized.
B. The owner, applicant, developer or its representative shall be on site at
all times when construction or grading activity takes place and shall
maintain the effectiveness of all erosion and sediment control practices.
Inspections shall be conducted and inspection reports shall be
completed by a landscape architect, certified professional in erosion

(4) If required by the SMO, an annual report shall be submitted to the
SMO within 30 calendar days of the end of the calendar year.
E. Prior to the issuance of any final plan approval, the owner, applicant or
developer must execute a formal maintenance agreement for
permanent stormwater management facilities, other than those serving
an individual single-family residence, binding on all subsequent
landowners. The maintenance agreement shall be in a form acceptable
to the Village Attorney and shall be recorded in the office of the County
Clerk as a deed restriction on the property. The Village of Croton-on-
Hudson, in lieu of a maintenance agreement, at its sole discretion may
accept dedication of any existing or future permanent stormwater
management facility, provided such facility meets all the requirements
of this article and includes adequate and perpetual access and
sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular
maintenance.
A. The Stormwater Management Officer may require such inspections as
are necessary to determine compliance with this article and may either
approve that portion of the work completed or notify the applicant
wherein the work fails to comply with the requirements of this article
and the stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as approved.
(1) To obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify Village
enforcement officials at least 48 hours before any of the following
as required by the Stormwater Management Officer:
(a) Start of construction;
(b) Installation of sediment and erosion control measures;
(c) Completion of site clearing;

(i) Successful establishment of landscaping in public areas.
(2) If any violations are found, the owner, applicant and/or developer
shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the
required corrective actions. No further work shall be conducted
except for site stabilization until any violations are corrected and
all work previously completed has received approval by the
Stormwater Management Officer.
B. It shall be the primary responsibility of the property owner(s) and the
successor property owner(s) to perform all necessary inspections,
maintenance, report submissions, adjustments, repair, replacement and
reconstruction of the stormwater management facilities. Required
inspections shall be conducted and reports prepared by a certified
professional in erosion and sediment control, a professional engineer or
other professional(s) deemed acceptable by the NYSDEC. If, at any
time, the Stormwater Management Officer determines that necessary
inspections, reports, maintenance, repairs, adjustments, replacements
or reconstructions have not been properly performed, notice of such
determination shall be given to the property owner(s) of the property or
properties upon which the stormwater facility or facilities are situated
and shall provide a reasonable period under the circumstances to cure
such improper performance. If the property owner(s) fails to timely
correct any and all deficiencies as provided in the notice, the Village
may undertake to perform any such work or work that it finds, in its sole
judgment, as necessary to preserve the stormwater management
functions or stormwater management practices (SMPs), at the cost and
expense of the property owner(s) and the successor property owner(s).
Copies of all bills, statements and invoices substantiating such costs,
including costs of consultants, shall be included with written notice of
same. In the event that all such costs and expenses are not paid within
30 days of issuance of statements for this work, the total cost of such
work shall constitute a lien against the property or properties upon
which the stormwater management facilities are situated, which shall
be levied and collected in the same manner as Village real estate taxes
or in such manner otherwise provided by law. The property owner(s)
and the successor property owner(s) shall be personally liable for the
payment of all such costs, including costs of collection and reasonable
attorney's fees. Where multiple lots are involved, each lot shall
individually and separately bear its equal share of such costs.
C. Except for activities regulated under § 196-7 herein, all applicants are
required to submit "as built" plans for any stormwater management
practices located on-site after final construction is completed. The plan
must show the final design specifications for all stormwater
management facilities and must be certified by a New York State
licensed land surveyor or professional engineer.

§ 196-11. Performance guarantee.
D. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis,
including, but not limited to: routine inspections; random inspections;
inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible
violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher
than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants;
inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher
than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges
of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause
violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or the
SPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies
inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may
include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair
records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and
material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the
condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater
management practices.
E. The Stormwater Management Officer may require monitoring and
reporting from entities subject to this article as are necessary to
determine compliance with this article.
F. When any new stormwater management facility is installed on private
property or when any new connection is made between private property
and the public stormwater system, the landowner shall grant to the
Village and other agencies having jurisdiction the right to enter the
property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the
purpose of inspection.
A. In order to ensure the full and faithful completion of all land
development activities related to compliance with all conditions set
forth by the Village in its approval of the stormwater pollution
prevention plan, the Village may require the owner, applicant or
developer to provide, prior to construction, a performance bond, cash
escrow, or irrevocable letter of credit from an appropriate financial or
surety institution which guarantees satisfactory completion of the
project and names the Village as the beneficiary. The security shall be in
an amount to be determined by the Village based on submission of final
design plans, with reference to actual construction and landscaping
costs. The performance guarantee shall remain in force until the surety
is released from liability by the Village, provided that such period shall
not be less than one year from the date of final acceptance or such other
certification that the facility(ies) has been constructed in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and that a one-year
inspection has been conducted and the facilities have been found to be
acceptable to the Village. Per-annum interest on cash escrow deposits
shall be reinvested in the account until the surety is released from
liability.
§ 196-10 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 196-11

B. Where stormwater management and erosion and sediment control
facilities are to be operated and maintained by the developer or by a
corporation that owns or manages a commercial or industrial facility,
the developer, prior to construction, may be required to provide the
Village with an irrevocable letter of credit from an approved financial
institution or surety to ensure proper operation and maintenance of all
stormwater management and erosion control facilities both during and
after construction based upon the advice of the SMO. If the developer
or landowner fails to properly operate and maintain stormwater
management and erosion and sediment control facilities, the Village
may draw upon the account to cover the costs of proper operation and
maintenance, including engineering and inspection costs.
C. Entities subject to this article shall maintain records demonstrating
compliance with this article.
A. When the SMO determines that a land development activity is not being
carried out in accordance with any requirement of this article, or that
any provision of this article is not being complied with, the SMO may
issue a written notice of violation to the landowner, applicant,
contractor and/or developer. The notice of violation shall contain:
(1) The name and address of the landowner, contractor, developer or
applicant;
(2) The address, when available, or a description of the building,
structure or land upon which the violation is occurring;
(3) A statement specifying the nature of the violation;
(4) A description of the remedial measures necessary to cure the
violation and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial
action; and
(5) A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be
assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is
directed.
B. If the notice of violation is not complied with within the time provided in
the notice, the SMO may request the Village Attorney to institute the
appropriate proceedings at law or in equity to prosecute, restrain,
correct or abate such violation and for other attendant remedial
measures.
C. The SMO may issue a stop-work order for violations of this article.
Persons receiving a stop-work order shall be required to halt all land
development activities and other construction activities on the site,
except those activities, approved by the SMO, that address the
violations leading to the stop-work order. The stop-work order shall be
in effect until the SMO confirms that the violation has been
§ 196-11 STORMWATER, DRAINAGE, EROSION AND § 196-12
196:269
satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a stop-work order in a
timely manner may result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in
accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this article.
D. Issuance of a stop-work order by the SMO shall be as provided in
Chapter 86 of the Village Code. A stop-work order may be appealed by
filing a written notice of appeal with the Planning Board not later than
30 days after service of the stop-work order upon the applicant. A
hearing shall be scheduled by the Planning Board within 20 days of
receipt of request for a hearing. After the close of the hearing, the
Planning Board may confirm, modify or cancel the stop-work order.
E. Any violation of this article may be restrained by injunction or
otherwise abated in a manner provided by this article.
F. Any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be guilty of
an offense punishable by a fine not less than $500 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both, for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $1,000 nor more than $1,500 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $1,500 nor more than
$2,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
G. In addition to any penalty provided herein or by law, any person in
violation of this article may be required to restore land to its
undisturbed condition and/or mitigate on-site and off-site damage from
stormwater runoff, sediment or pollutants resulting from the violator's
activities. In the event that restoration is not undertaken within a
reasonable time after notice, the SMO may take necessary corrective
action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until
paid.
H. Under exigent circumstances, if any building or land development
activity, minor land disturbance activity or permanent stormwater
management facility is installed, conducted or operated in violation of
this article, the Stormwater Management Officer may prevent the
occupancy of said building or land, including the withholding of a
certificate of occupancy. It shall be the obligation of the property owner
to remediate the violation, at which time the Stormwater Management
Officer shall further consider allowing occupancy of the building or
land.

flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee
shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to
a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the
use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse.

§ 196-21. Suspension of access to MS4.
§ 196-22. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Village prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. All
reports submitted to the NYSDEC as required by the SPDES permit shall
also be contemporaneously transmitted to the SMO.
§ 196-23. Access to property; inspection; monitoring of discharges.
A. The SMO may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and
substantial danger to the environment, to the health or welfare of
persons, or to the MS4. The SMO shall notify the person of such
suspension within a reasonable time thereafter, in writing, including
the reasons for the suspension. If the violator fails to comply with a
suspension order issued in an emergency, the SMO may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or to
minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illegal discharge. Any person
discharging to the Village's MS4 in violation of this article may have his
or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illegal discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration. Access may be
granted by the SMO, with or without conditions, if he/she finds that the
illegal discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to
prevent its recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in
writing that the illegal discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A
person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
§ 196-21 STORMWATER, DRAINAGE, EROSION AND § 196-23
196:279
§ 196-24. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of this article, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which is resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Village in person or by telephone
or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
(3) The Village shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to
this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO
to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge or conduct other testing as deemed necessary by the
SMO.
(4) The Village has the right to require the facilities subject to this
article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary
to determine compliance with this article. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village access to a facility
subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person who is
the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an offense if
the person denies the Village reasonable access to the facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 196-23 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 196-24
196:280
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the Village within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
Appropriate state and federal agencies shall also be notified as per
applicable regulations.
§ 196-25. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. Notice of violation. When the SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the SMO may
order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible
person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or illegal discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; and
(5) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by the Village or a
contractor designated by the Village and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
C. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
D. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred and
remains unabated. Upon determination that a violation has occurred
and remains unabated, the SMO may seek a court order to take any and
all measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property. The cost of implementing and maintaining such measures
shall be the sole responsibility of the discharger.
§ 196-24 STORMWATER, DRAINAGE, EROSION AND § 196-25
196:281
§ 196-26. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may request
the Village Attorney to petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction
restraining the person from activities which would create further violations
or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
§ 196-27. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of
this article is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is declared
and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored at
the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 196-28. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this article are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within
E. Within 30 days after abatement of the violation by or under
authorization of the SMO, the owner of the property will be notified of
the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property
owner may file a written protest with the Village Board of Trustees
objecting to the amount of the assessment within 10 days of receipt of
said notice. If the amount due is not paid within 30 days after the
disposition of any protests or the expiration of the time to file an appeal,
whichever is earlier, the charges shall become a lien on the property for
the amount of the assessment to be collected in the same manner as
real estate taxes.
F. Any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be guilty of a
offense punishable by a fine not less than $500 nor more than $1,000 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both; for
conviction of a second offense, both of which were committed within a
period of five years, punishable by a fine not less than $1,000 nor more
than $1,500 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or
both; and upon conviction for a third or subsequent offense, all of which
were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a fine not
less than $1,500 nor more than $2,000 or imprisonment for a period not
to exceed six months, or both. However, for the purposes of conferring
jurisdiction upon courts and judicial officers generally, violations of this
article shall be deemed misdemeanors, and for such purpose only all
provisions of law relating to misdemeanors shall apply to such
violations. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a separate
additional violation.

the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies.
§ 196-29. Severability.
If any provision of this chapter or of any article, section, subsection,
paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter shall be judged invalid for
any reason by a court of competent jurisdiction, such order or judgment
shall not affect or invalidate the remainder of any article, section,
subsection, paragraph, subdivision or clause of this chapter.

Street Tree Sidewalk Improvement Program
[Adopted 8-10-2015 by L.L. No. 6-201591]
§ 197-32. Purpose.
The Board of Trustees has made a determination that many sidewalks
located within the Village are in significant need of repair due to certain
Village trees planted in the Village right-of-way. The Board of Trustees also
recognizes that the repair of sidewalks can be costly and that it imposes
a difficult economic hardship on the homeowner to keep the sidewalks
in good repair. The Board of Trustees has determined that it is in the
best interests of the Village to have properly maintained sidewalks and,
therefore, has decided to assist residents in maintaining the sidewalks to
the extent outlined within this article.
§ 197-33. Administration. [Amended 3-4-2019 by L.L. No. 4-2019]
Any owner of real property within the Village whose real property abuts
on any public street may be eligible for the following sidewalk replacement
program hereby established:
A. If the sidewalk is in need of repair or replacement, the owner of said
property may make application to the Village requesting that the
sidewalk be repaired or replaced. A fee for the filing of said application
may be established by resolution of the Village Board of Trustees and
placed in the fee schedule. Applications will be processed and acted
upon at the sole discretion of the Village.
B. The Superintendent of Public Works, or his designee, will visit the site
to determine if a Village street tree has contributed to the cause of the
damaged sidewalk. Upon his determination, the Village will authorize
and pay for the removal of the street tree.
C. The Village will pay 50% of the actual contract cost for the removal and
replacement of sidewalks to property owners who apply during the
period of October 1, 2015, to May 31, 2019, of the sidewalk
replacement program, including materials and labor for the repairs and
reconstruction. Beginning on June 1, 2019, the Village will pay 40% of
the actual cost for the removal and replacement of sidewalks to
property owners who apply during the period of June 1, 2019, to May
31, 2020. The prevailing rate established by the Village will be used in
determining the total cost of the improvements.
D. The Village Engineer or the Superintendent of Public Works shall
determine the nature and extent of sidewalk repairs qualifying for
reimbursement under this program. After review of the application by
the Village Engineer and the determination of repairs qualifying for

and § 197-24 of the Village Code requiring maintenance, repair, and snow
and ice removal, the owner and the occupant shall be liable to all persons
injured, or whose property is damaged directly, or indirectly, and shall be

reimbursement, the Village Engineer will notify the applicant, in
writing, of the contribution to be made by the property owner. After
receipt of the property owner's share of the cost of the work, all repairs
and reconstruction will be scheduled and performed by the Department
of Public Works or its designated agent. All work shall be subject to
inspection by the Village Engineer or his designee during construction,
and must be approved by the Village Engineer.
E. The Village encourages pooling of neighborhoods interested in
repairing or replacing their sidewalks. The deadline date for pooling is
March 31 of each year.
F. The Village will provide funding only to the extent that Village funds for
the sidewalk improvement program are available, and such availability
will be at the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees. Failure of the
Board of Trustees to budget funds for repair of sidewalks shall in no
way excuse any property owner from properly maintaining, repairing,
constructing or replacing sidewalks in accordance with Article IV of
Chapter 197 of the Croton-on-Hudson Village Code.
G. After the period of the sidewalk improvement program set forth above
has elapsed, all property owners who have not applied for participation
in the program whose real property abuts on any public street shall be
responsible for undertaking all repairs or improvements at their own
expense without any Village subsidy in accordance with the provisions
of § 197-24 of the Village Code and further the Village will carry out its
responsibilities in accordance with §§ 197-25, 197-26 and 197-27 of the

permittee shall provide a trained flagger(s) to control traffic in the
work and traffic control zones. Flagging operations shall be in
accordance with guidelines in the latest edition of the Cornell Local
Roads Program Work Zone Safety Handbook and Flaggers
Handbook or approved Maintenance and Protection of Traffic Plan.
Additional flaggers may be required by the Village Engineer or
§ 197-52 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 197-52
196:310
Superintendent based on conditions in the work and traffic control
zones.
(4) Whenever any permittee fails to provide or maintain any safety
devices required by the permit or Village Engineer or
Superintendent, such devices may be installed and/or maintained
by the Village. The amount of the cost incurred shall be paid by the
permittee or deducted from his deposit. Such costs shall be
determined by the Village.
(5) No person shall willfully move, remove, injure, destroy or
extinguish any signs, channelizing devices, lighting devices and

not actually in progress. Temporary access to driveways must be
provided as needed by the property owners and their tenants at all
times. Proper access must be provided at all times to fire hydrants.
N. Excavated materials shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench
and kept trimmed up so as to cause as little inconvenience as possible
to public travel. In order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate a dirt
or dust nuisance, the Village Engineer or Superintendent may require
the permittee to place the excavated material directly into a vehicle or
container. If the excavated area causes inconveniences to pedestrians,
temporary walks and, if required, fencing shall be installed by the
permittee as directed by the Village Engineer or Superintendent.
O. Work authorized by a permit shall be performed between the hours of
8:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m., Monday through Saturday and between the
hours of 10:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. on Sunday, unless the permittee
obtains written consent from the Village Engineer or Superintendent to
do the work at an earlier or later hour. Such permission shall be granted
only in case of an emergency or special circumstances.
P. In granting any permit, the Village Engineer may attach such other
conditions thereto as may be reasonably necessary to prevent damage
to public or private property or to prevent the operation from being
conducted in a manner hazardous to life or property or in a manner
likely to create a nuisance or unacceptably disrupt traffic. Such
conditions may include, but shall not be limited to:
(1) Limitations on the period of the year in which the work may be
performed;
(2) Limitations on the time of day in which the work may be performed;
(3) Restrictions as to the size and type of equipment;
(4) Designation of routes upon which materials may be transported;
(5) The place and manner of disposal of excavated materials;

§ 197-53. Backfilling and pavement restoration.
(6) Requirements as to dust control, the cleaning of streets, the
prevention of noise and other results offensive or injurious to the
neighborhood, the general public or any portion thereof; and
(7) Regulations as to the use of streets in the course of the work.
A. All pavement cuts, openings and excavations shall be properly made,
backfilled and temporarily surfaced by the permittee according to the
permit conditions and Village specifications.
B. The Village Engineer or Superintendent must be notified by the
permittee during the forty-eight-hour period preceding beginning of
backfilling, of the date and approximate time at which backfilling will
be begun.
C. No backfilling shall be begun unless or until either the Village Engineer,
the Superintendent or a designated Village inspector is present.
D. After excavation is commenced, the work of making and backfilling the
same shall be prosecuted and completed with due diligence.
E. The work of the permanent restoration, including both paving surface,
paving base, and subbase shall be performed by the permittee
according to permit conditions and Village specifications.
F. Where trenches are made parallel to the street, or where a number of
cross trenches are laid in close proximity to one another or are
numerous, or where the equipment used may cause such additional
damage to the pavement, the Village Manager may require a negotiated
payment from the permittee for the final pavement restoration of such
street if, in his opinion, the damage to the pavement will be so excessive
it will require the complete resurfacing of the street area involved. Such
negotiations shall be carried on and payment agreed upon prior to
issuance of a permit.
G. Upon completion of all work accomplished under the provisions of the
permit, the permittee shall notify the Village Engineer in writing. A
certificate of final inspection shall be issued by the Village Engineer to
each permittee no sooner than one year after the permanent
restoration of the excavation has been made, provided that the work
authorized by the permit has been performed according to Village
specifications. Prior to the issuance of a certificate, the Village
Engineer or Superintendent shall make a final inspection of the
restoration to determine whether Village specifications have been
adhered to.
H. If any settlement in a restored area occurs within a period of one year
from the date of completion of the permanent restoration, the permittee
is required to correct the settlement and repair the pavement within 30
days of notification by the Village. If the contractor does not complete
§ 197-52 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 197-53
196:312
§ 197-54. Deposits.
the work within the time frame specified, the Village has the right to
make the repair. Any expense incurred by the Village in correcting such
settlement shall be paid by the permittee or recovered from his bond,
unless the permittee submits proof satisfactory to the Village Engineer
that the settlement was not due to defective backfilling.
I. In no case shall any opening made by a permittee be considered in the
charge or care of the Village or any of its, officers or employees, and no
officer or employee is authorized in any way to take or assume any
jurisdiction over any such opening, except in the exercise of police
power, when it is necessary to protect life and property.
J. If any restoration completed by a permittee is not satisfactory to the
Village Engineer or Superintendent, and the permittee shall fail to
correct the work to his satisfaction, he may cause such work to be
redone to his satisfaction including hiring a contractor to perform the
work. All expenses incurred by the Village shall be recovered from the
deposit and/or bond provided by the permittee under this article.
K. If the Village Engineer or Superintendent finds that pavement surfaces
outside the minimum pavement restoration limits were damaged by the
permittee, the Village Engineer or Superintendent may expand the
pavement restoration limits to include these damaged pavement
surfaces or that these damaged pavement surfaces are otherwise
repaired by the permittee to his satisfaction.
L. All permanent pavement restoration shall be performed to the limits
shown on the drawing of minimum pavement restoration limits which
shall be approved by the Village Board of Trustees by resolution and on
file in the Village Clerk's office.
M. The permittee is responsible to ensure that the pavement restoration
does not cause an increase in drainage flow from the restored pavement
onto driveways or other surfaces adjacent to the restored pavement
compared to preexisting conditions. If the pavement restoration results
in an increase in drainage flow, the permittee shall correct the drainage
condition to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer or Superintendent
within 30 days. If the drainage condition is not corrected in 30 days, the
Village Engineer or Superintendent may cause such work to be done to
his satisfaction including hiring a contractor to perform the work. All
expenses incurred by the Village shall be recovered from the deposit
and/or bond provided by the permittee under this article.
A. Computation of deposits. The Village Engineer, upon receipt of a
properly completed application, shall determine the amount of the
deposit to be made by the permittee; provided, however, that the
deposit shall not be less than an amount to be determined by the Village
Board by resolution and set in the minimum pavement restoration limits
drawing. The deposit shall be paid prior to the permit being issued, and
§ 197-53 STORMWATER, DRAINAGE, EROSION AND § 197-54
196:313
§ 197-55. Bond requirements.
the deposit shall be used to reimburse the Village for the cost of
any work and materials furnished by it in connection with the work
authorized by the permit and for any other purpose set forth in this
article including the cost of any police personnel services established
by the Village Manager.
B. Form of deposit. The deposit may be either in the form of a check, or in
lawful money of the United States.
C. Insufficient deposit. If any deposit is less than sufficient to pay all costs,
the permittee shall, upon demand, pay to the Village an amount equal to
the deficiency. If the permittee refuses or fails to pay such deficiency,
the Village may institute an action to recover the same in any court of
competent jurisdiction. Until such deficiency is paid in full, no
additional permits shall be issued to such permittee.
D. Yearly deposit. Whenever any public utility or authority shall anticipate
more than one street opening or excavation per calendar year, such
utility or authority may post one deposit in an amount and form as
provided above for the calendar year or part thereof to cover the cost of
any and all work.
E. Deposit and cost schedules. The amount of deposit for street openings
shall be established by the Village Engineer based on the type and
nature of the proposed work and shall not be less than the minimum
amount set forth in the fee schedule.
F. Refund of deposit. Upon notification by the permittee that all work
authorized by the permit has been completed, and after restoration of
the opening and final inspection, the Village Engineer shall refund to
the permittee his deposit less all costs incurred by the Village in
connection with said permit and any other expenses required by this
article, for which final settlement has not been made. In no event shall
the permit fee be refunded once work has been undertaken.
A. Bond requirements. Each applicant prior to the issuance of a permit
shall provide the Village with an acceptable bond to guarantee faithful
performance of the work authorized by a permit granted pursuant to
this article. The amount of the bond shall be 100% of the estimated cost
of restoring the street opening as determined by the Village Engineer.
The term of the bond shall begin upon the date of posting thereof and
shall terminate upon the receipt by the permittee of a certificate of final
inspection from the Village Engineer. If the permittee anticipates
requesting more than one permit per year as required by this article, he
may furnish one continuing corporate surety bond to guarantee faithful
performance in such amount as the Village Engineer deems necessary.
The amount of such bond shall be in relation to the cost of restoring
pavement cuts to be made by the permittee throughout the year.
§ 197-54 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 197-55
196:314
§ 197-56. Insurance requirements.
Each applicant, prior to the issuance of a permit, shall provide the Village
with acceptable documentation of insurance coverage in accordance with
the Village's insurance requirements for permits on file with the Village
Clerk.
§ 197-57. Openings in new streets.
Restriction upon opening new streets. No permit shall be issued by the
Village Engineer which would allow an excavation or opening in a paved and
improved street surface less than three years old, unless the applicant can
clearly demonstrate that public health or safety require that the proposed
work be permitted or unless an emergency condition exists.
§ 197-58. Map requirements.
§ 197-59. Abandoned facilities.
B. Default in performance. Whenever the Village Engineer shall find that a
default has occurred in the performance of any term or condition of the
permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the permittee and if the
bond is a surety bond to the surety on the bond. Such notice shall state
the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof and the period of time
deemed by the Village Engineer to be reasonably necessary for the
completion of such work.
C. Completion of work. After receipt of such notice, the permittee and/or
surety must, within the time therein specified, either cause the required
work to be performed or, failing therein, indemnify the Village for the
cost of doing the work as set forth in the notice.
A. Every person owning, using, controlling or having an interest in pipes,
conduits, ducts or other structures under the surface of any street used
for the purpose of supplying or conveying gas, electricity,
communication impulses or data, to or from the Village or to or from its
inhabitants, or for any other purposes, shall file with the Village
Engineer such maps or sets of maps, drawn to a scale suitable for the
purposes required, showing the location, size and dimensions of all
such installations, whenever, in the opinion of the Village Engineer,
such maps are necessary for the safe and proper undertaking of street
opening work.
B. Each map herein required shall be accompanied by an affidavit,
endorsed thereon to the effect that the same reasonably exhibits the
details required to be shown by this section as of the time of filing to the
best of the permittee's knowledge and information.
A. Whenever any pipe, conduit, duct, tunnel or other structure located
under the surface of any street, or the use thereof, is abandoned, the
person owning, controlling or having an interest therein shall, within 30

statement, in writing, giving in detail the location of the structure so
abandoned.
B. Each map or set of maps filed pursuant to the provisions of this article
shall show in detail the location of all such structures abandoned
subsequent to the filing of the last preceding map or set of maps.
C. When the Village plans to pave or improve streets in which there are
abandoned facilities, the owner of such facilities shall be notified to
remove them if, in the opinion of the Board of Trustees, their removal is
in the best interest of the Village. If the owner shall refuse to remove
such facilities, the Village shall remove the abandoned facilities and the
owner shall reimburse the Village for such removal.

General Sidewalk Improvement Program
[Adopted 3-4-2019 by L.L. No. 4-201992]
§ 197-61. Purpose.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson hereby
determines that many sidewalks located within the Village are in need of
significant repair. The Board of Trustees also recognizes that the repair of
sidewalks can be costly and that it imposes a difficult economic hardship on
the homeowner to keep the sidewalks in good repair. The Board of Trustees
has determined that it is in the best interests of the Village to have properly
maintained sidewalks and, therefore, has decided to assist residents in
maintaining the sidewalks to the extent outlined within this article.
§ 197-62. Administration.
Any owner of real property within the Village whose real property abuts
on any public street may be eligible for the following sidewalk replacement
program hereby established:
A. If the sidewalk is in need of repair or replacement, the owner of said
property may make application to the Village requesting that the
sidewalk be repaired or replaced. A fee for the filing of said application
may be established by resolution of the Village Board of Trustees and
placed in the fee schedule. Applications will be processed and acted
upon at the sole discretion of the Village.
B. The Village will pay 40% of the actual cost for the removal and
replacement of sidewalks to residents who apply during the period from
June 1, 2019 to May 31, 2022. These costs shall include materials and
labor for the repairs and reconstruction. The prevailing rate established
by the Village will be used in determining the total cost of the
improvements.
C. The Village Engineer or the Superintendent of Public Works shall
determine the nature and extent of sidewalk repairs qualifying for
reimbursement under this program. After review of the application by
the Village Engineer and the determination of repairs qualifying for
reimbursement, the Village Engineer will notify the applicant in writing
of the contribution to be made by the property owner. After receipt of
the property owner's share of the cost of the work, all repairs and
reconstruction will be scheduled and performed by the Department of
Public Works or its designated agent. All work shall be subject to
inspection by the Village Engineer, or his designee, during construction
and must be approved by the Village Engineer once completed.
92.Editor's Note: This local law added this new material as Art. VIII, §§ 197-35 through
197-37. The article was renumbered as Art. X and the sections renumbered as §§ 197-61
through 197-63 to accommodate the addition of Arts. VIII and IX (§§ 197-35 through
197-60) by L.L. No. 1-2019.
§ 197-61 STORMWATER, DRAINAGE, EROSION AND § 197-62
196:317
§ 197-63. Liability.
In the event that personal injury or property damage shall result from the
failure of any owner or occupant to comply with the provisions of §§ 197-15
and 197-24 of the Village Code requiring maintenance, repair and snow and
ice removal, the owner or occupant shall be liable to all persons injured, or
whose property is damaged directly, or indirectly, and shall be liable to the
Village to the extent that said Village is required by law or by any court to
respond in damages to any injured party.
D. The Village encourages pooling of neighborhoods interested in
repairing or replacing their sidewalks. The deadline for pooling shall be
March 31 of each year.
E. The Village will provide funding only to the extent that Village funds for
the sidewalk improvement program are available. Such availability
shall be determined at the sole discretion of the Board of Trustees.
Failure of the Board of Trustees to budget funds for repair of sidewalks
shall in no way excuse any property owner from properly maintaining,
repairing, constructing or replacing sidewalks in accordance with
Article IV of Chapter 197 of the Croton-on-Hudson Village Code.
F. After the three-year period of the sidewalk improvement program has
elapsed, all property owners who have not applied for participation in
the program whose real property abuts on any public street shall be
responsible for undertaking all repairs or improvements at their own
expense without any Village subsidy in accordance with the provisions
of § 197-24 of the Village Code. Further to this, the Village shall carry
out its responsibilities in accordance with §§ 197-25, 197-26 and 197-27
of the Village Code.
G. Any owner who no longer has a physical sidewalk on his or her property,
but can document that such a sidewalk previously existed may also be
eligible to make application under this program based upon the
feasibility of reestablishing such sidewalk at the discretion of the
Village Engineer and Superintendent of Public Works.

TATTOOS
§ 202-1. Findings.
It has been the experience of other municipalities, including the City of New
York, that tattooing has led to increased cases of serum hepatitis. It has also
been their experience that regulatory measures have proved ineffective in
eliminating this health risk because of the inability to supervise tattooing
establishments at all times. The Village of Croton-on-Hudson also lacks
the resources and personnel to supervise tattooing establishments on an
ongoing basis. Accordingly, the Board of Trustees finds that in this village,
as in other communities, a ban on tattooing except for medical purposes is
the only feasible means of protecting the public against disease from this
source.
§ 202-2. Prohibited activities; exceptions.
It shall be unlawful for any person to tattoo a human being within the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson, except that tattooing may be performed for
medical purposes by a person licensed or otherwise authorized pursuant to
the Education Law to practice medicine or osteopathy.

excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers subject to such supervision
under Article 7 of the Transportation Law, and a tax equal to 1% of its gross

the Transportation Law and persons engaged in the business of operating
or leasing sleeping and parlor railroad cars or of operating railroads other

§ 204-3. Records.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of its

202:322
§ 204-4. Utilities to file returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file, on or before April 25, July
25, October 25 and January 25, a return for the three calendar months
preceding each such return date, including any period for which the tax
imposed hereby or by any amendment hereof is effective, each of which
returns shall state the gross income or gross operating income for the
period covered by each such return. Returns shall be filed with the
Treasurer of the Village on a form to be furnished by him for such purpose
and which shall contain such other data, information or matter as he may
require to be included therein. Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions
of this section, any utility whose average gross income or average gross
operating income, as the case may be, for the aforesaid three months'
period is less than $1,500 may file a return annually on January 25 for the
12 preceding calendar months, and the Treasurer of the Village may require
any utility to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified
by him, regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this section.
The Treasurer, in order to ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require
at any time a further or supplemental return, which shall contain any data
that may be specified by him. Every return shall have annexed thereto a
certification by the head of the utility making the same, or of the owner or
of a copartner thereof, or of a principal officer of the corporation, if such
business is conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the statements
contained therein are true.
§ 204-5. Tax payable with return.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall pay
to the Treasurer of the Village the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 204-6. Failure to submit acceptable return.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Treasurer of the Village and if a corrected or
sufficient return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by
notice from him or if no return is made for any period, the Treasurer
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against
whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of
such determination, apply to the Treasurer for a hearing or unless the
Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing,
the Treasurer shall give notice of his decision to the person liable for
the tax. Any final determination of the amount of any tax payable
hereunder shall be reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality
§ 204-4 TATTOOS § 204-6
202:323
§ 204-7. Service of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 204-8. Penalties.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Treasurer of
the Village, for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and,
if satisfied that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the
penalty fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 204-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the giving of notice of any determination or
assessment of any tax or penalty, the person liable for the tax shall make
application for a refund thereof and the Treasurer of the Village or the
court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was
erroneously or illegally collected, the Treasurer shall refund the amount so
determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund may be so
or any other reason whatsoever by a proceeding under Article 78 of
the Civil Practice Law and Rules if application therefor is made to the
Supreme Court within 90 days after the giving of the notice of such
final determination; provided, however, that any such proceeding under
said Article 78 shall not be instituted unless the amount of any tax
sought to be reviewed, with such interest and penalties thereon as
may be provided for by local law, ordinances or resolution, shall be
first deposited and an undertaking filed, in such amount and with such
sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve, to the effect
that if such proceeding is dismissed or the tax confirmed, the petitioner
will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the prosecution of
such proceeding.

evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a

required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.

of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of the Treasurer as
hereinbefore provided unless the Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore
provided or of his own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it
shall have been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York that such determination
was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of money collected
under this article. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore
provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or
penalty complained of, and the Treasurer may receive additional evidence
with respect thereto. After making his determination, the Treasurer shall
give notice thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an
order to review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the
provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such an order.

article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Treasurer of the
Village, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of
any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 204-12. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this article, the Treasurer of the Village shall have
power to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with
law, as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance
of his duties and to prescribe the form of blanks, reports and other records
relating to the administration and enforcement of the tax, to take testimony
and proofs, under oath, with reference to any matter within the line of his

proceeding under the provisions of this article or on behalf of the State

the Tax Law of the State of New York or on behalf of any party to
any action or proceeding under the provisions of this article when the
returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in such action
or proceeding, in either of which events the court may require the
production of and may admit in evidence so much of said returns or of
the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or proceeding
and no more.
B. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the delivery to a person or
his duly authorized representative of a copy of any return filed by him
nor to prohibit the publication of statistics so classified as to prevent
the identification of particular returns and the items thereof or the
publication of delinquent lists showing the names of persons who have
failed to pay their taxes at the time and in the manner provided for by
this article, together with any relevant information which, in the
opinion of the Treasurer, may assist in the collection of such delinquent
taxes or the inspection by the Village Attorney or other legal
representatives of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson of the return of any
person who shall bring action to set aside or review the tax based
thereon or against whom an action has been instituted in accordance
with the provisions of this article.

punishable by a fine not exceeding $1,000 or by imprisonment not
exceeding one year, or both; and if the offender is an officer, agent,

other Village in the State of New York information contained by returns
filed under this article, provided that such city or other Village grants
similar privileges to the Village of Croton-on-Hudson, and provided that
such information is to be used for tax purposes only, and the Treasurer
shall, upon request, furnish the State Tax Commission with any
information contained in such returns.

§ 204-32. Exceptions.
A. All taxes of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson imposed on real property
containing a dwelling unit are hereby abated by one of the following
amounts:
(1) Where the head of household does not receive a monthly allowance
for shelter pursuant to the Social Services Law, the taxes shall be
abated by an amount not in excess of that portion of any increase in
maximum rent or legal regulated rent that causes such maximum
rent or legal regulated rent to exceed 1/3 of the combined income
of all members of the household; or
(2) Where the head of the household receives a monthly allowance for
shelter pursuant to the Social Services Law, the taxes shall be

years of age or older, no tax abatement shall be granted if the combined
income of all members of the household for the income tax year
immediately preceding the date of making application exceeds the
maximum allowable income provided below; provided, however, that
when the head of the household retires before the commencement of
such income tax year and the date of filing the application, the income

July 1, 2014 $50,000

C. Notwithstanding the foregoing Subsections A and B, in the event the
maximum allowable incomes established under Real Property Tax Law
§ 467-b for dwelling units where the head of the household is a person
62 years of age or older or a qualified person with a disability is
reduced, by operation of law or by action of the State Legislature, to an
amount less than $50,000, the maximum allowable incomes under this
§ 204-32 shall automatically reduce to said statutory maximum
allowable incomes.
A. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, when a head of the
household to whom a then current, valid tax abatement certificate has
been issued moves his or her principal residence from one dwelling unit
to a subsequent dwelling unit located within the Village, the head of the
household may apply for a tax abatement certificate relating to the
subsequent dwelling unit, and such certificate may provide that the
head of the household shall be exempt from paying that portion of the
maximum rent or legal regulated rent for the subsequent dwelling unit
that is the least of the following:
(1) The amount by which the rent for the subsequent dwelling unit
exceeds the last rent, as reduced, that the head of the household
was required to actually pay in the original dwelling unit;
(2) The last amount deducted from the maximum rent or legal
regulated rent pursuant to this section in the original dwelling unit;
or
(3) Where the head of the household does not receive a monthly
allowance for shelter pursuant to the Social Services Law, the
amount by which the maximum rent or legal regulated rent of the
subsequent dwelling unit exceeds one-third of the combined
income of all members of the household.

household to whom a then current, valid tax abatement certificate has
been issued moves his or her principal residence from one dwelling unit
subject to the provisions of Articles II, IV, V or XI of the Private Housing
Finance Law to a subsequent dwelling unit subject to either the Local
Emergency Housing Rent Control Law or to the Emergency Tenant
Protection Act of 1974 that is located within the Village, the head of the
household may apply for a tax abatement certificate relating to the
subsequent dwelling unit, and such certificate may provide that the
head of the household shall be exempt from paying that portion of the
§ 204-32 TATTOOS § 204-33
202:343
§ 204-34. Application for redetermination in case of decrease in
income.
Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, where a head of
the household holds a current, valid tax abatement certificate and, after the
effective date of this section, there is a permanent decrease in the combined
income of all members of the household in an amount that exceeds 20% of
such income as represented in such head of the household's last approved
application for a tax abatement certificate or for renewal thereof, such
head of the household may apply for a redetermination of the amount
set forth therein. Upon application, such amount shall be redetermined
so as to reestablish the ratio of adjusted rent to income that existed at
the time of approval of such head of the household's last application for a
tax abatement certificate or for renewal thereof; provided, however, that
in no event shall the amount of the adjusted rent be redetermined to be,

C. The Board of Trustees is hereby authorized to review and approve,
approve with modifications or disapprove special use permits pursuant
to this chapter. The Board of Trustees shall have the authority to impose
such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to
and incidental to the proposed antenna, tower or accessory structures.
A. Collocation requirements.
(1) A proposal for a tower shall not be approved unless the Board of
Trustees finds that the antenna planned for the proposed tower
cannot be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or
§ 206-2 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 206-4
206:357
building within a two-mile radius (one-mile search radius for
towers under 80 feet in height) of the proposed tower due to one or
more of the following reasons:
(a) The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the
existing or approved tower or building, as documented by a
qualified professional engineer, and the existing or approved
tower cannot be reinforced, modified or replaced to
accommodate the planned or equivalent antenna at a
reasonable cost.
(b) The antenna would cause interference materially impacting
the usability of other existing or planned antennas at the tower
or building, as documented by a qualified engineer, and the
interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(c) Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search
radius cannot accommodate the antenna at a height necessary
to function reasonably, as documented by a qualified engineer.
(d) Other foreseen reasons that make it not feasible to locate the
antenna upon an existing or approved tower or building.
(2) The applicant shall have the burden of proof to establish the
existence of any of the reasons set forth in Subsection A(1)(a)
through (d) above.
B. Any proposed tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically and in
all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and
comparable antennas, whether using the same or different
technologies, for at least three additional users if the tower is over 100
feet in height or for at least one additional user if the tower is over 60
feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future
rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas
mounted at varying heights.
C. The applicant shall submit to the Board of Trustees a letter of intent
committing the applicant, and his/her successors in interest, to
negotiate in good faith for shared use of the proposed tower by other
PWS providers in the future. The issuance of a permit (assuming the
tower is approved according to this section) shall commit the new tower
owner and his/her successors in interest to:
(1) Respond in a timely comprehensive manner to a request for
information from a potential shared-use applicant and to provide
information at the request of any public body or authority that has
received, or is exercising jurisdiction over, an application from a
potential shared-use party.
(2) Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use
of the new tower by other PWS providers.
§ 206-4 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 206-4
206:358
§ 206-5. Performance standards.
(3) Allow shared use of the new tower if another PWS provider agrees
in writing to pay charges.
(4) Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use, based on
generally accepted accounting principles, no greater than
prevailing charges for similar shared uses in Westchester County.
The charge may include but is not limited to a pro rata share of the
cost of site selection, planning, project administration, land costs,
site design, construction and maintenance financing, return on
equity, depreciation and all of the costs of adapting the tower or
equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
D. In order to keep neighboring municipalities informed, and to facilitate
the possibility of directing that an existing tall structure or existing
tower in a neighboring municipality be considered for shared use, the
Board of Trustees shall require that:
(1) An applicant who proposes a new tower shall notify, in writing, the
legislative body of each municipality that borders the Village and
the County Planning Board. Notification shall include the exact
location of the proposed tower and a general description of the
project, including but not limited to the height of the tower and its
capacity for future shared use.
(2) Documentation of this notification shall be submitted to the Board
of Trustees at the time of application.
E. The Board of Trustees may designate a preferred area or areas for the
siting of towers within the Village and, if no existing tower or tall
building in a neighboring community will obviate the need for a tower
within the Village and a designated preferred area is functionally and
financially adequate for the applicant's service requirements and will
not result in a violation of § 206-5F(3) of this chapter, then the applicant
must use its best efforts to locate its tower in such area.
F. The applicant must establish that there is no other available area
functionally and financially adequate for a tower location that will have
less visual or aesthetic impact.
A. Proof of noninterference from antenna. Each application for installation
of an antenna shall include either a preliminary or a certified statement
that the installation of the antenna, including reception and
transmission functions, will not interfere with the radio or television
service enjoyed by residential and nonresidential properties or with
public safety telecommunications. In the event that only a preliminary
statement is submitted with the application, a final certified statement
of noninterference will be provided and approved by the Village prior to
the issuance of a permit. The statement shall be prepared by a
§ 206-4 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 206-5
206:359
professional engineer. In the event that the functioning of an antenna
causes interference with such radio or television service or public
safety telecommunications and continues for a period of 30 days after
notice to the owner of the tower and user of the antenna, the special
permit shall become null and void.
B. Antenna safety. Antennas shall be subject to state and federal
regulations pertaining to nonionizing radiation and other health
hazards related to such facilities. The owner of the antenna shall submit
to the Board of Trustees evidence of compliance with the FCC
standards on a yearly basis. If new, more restrictive standards are
adopted, the antennas shall be made to comply or continued operations
may be restricted or prohibited by the Board of Trustees. The cost of
verification of compliance shall be borne by the owner and operator of
the tower.
C. Tower lighting. Towers shall not be illuminated by artificial means and
shall not display any lights unless such lighting is specifically required
by the Federal Aviation Administration or other federal or state
authority for a particular tower. When incorporated into the approved
design of the tower, light fixtures used to illuminate ball fields, parking
lots or similar areas may be attached to the tower.
D. Signs and advertising on towers. The use of any portions of a tower for
signs other than warning or equipment information signs is prohibited.
Any signs must be approved as to size and location by the Board of
Trustees.
E. Tower height limitations. No tower shall be higher than the minimum
height necessary to achieve its objective. Maximum height of a tower is
limited to 150 feet above the ground upon which the antenna is placed.
The Board of Trustees may allow towers up to 200 feet high if the
applicant can demonstrate, based upon the topography of the site and
surrounding area, siting of the antenna, antenna design, surrounding
tree cover and structures and/or through the use of screening, that offsite
views of the tower will be minimized. The height limitation may be
waived by the Board of Trustees when the antenna is mounted on an
existing building or structure or to accommodate collocation.
F. Tower building requirements.
(1) The use of guyed towers is prohibited. Towers must be selfsupporting
without the use of wires, cables, beams or other means.
The design should utilize an open framework or monopole
configuration. Permanent platforms or structures exclusive of
antennas that serve to increase off-site visibility are prohibited.
(2) The base of the tower shall occupy no more than 500 square feet,
and the top of the tower shall be no larger than the base.
(3) In instances in which collocation cannot be accomplished, the
minimum spacing between tower locations is 1/4 mile.
§ 206-5 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 206-5
206:360
G. Access to towers. A road and parking must be provided to assure
adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing
roads, public or private, shall be made.
H. Setbacks for towers and accessory structures. Towers and all accessory
structures shall conform with each of the following minimum setback
requirements:
(1) The minimum setbacks of the underlying zoning districts shall be
met with the exception of industrial zoning districts, where towers
and accessory structures may encroach into the rear setback area,
provided that the rear property line abuts another industrially
zoned property and the tower does not encroach upon any
easements.
(2) Towers and accessory structures shall be set back from the planned
public rights-of-way, as shown on the most recently adopted plan or
map of the Village showing such rights-of-way, by a minimum
distance equal to 1/2 of the height of the tower, including all
antennas and attachments.
(3) A tower's setback may be reduced in the sole discretion of the
Board of Trustees to allow the integration of a tower into an
existing or proposed structure such as a church steeple, light pole,
power line or similar structure.
I. Compliance with subdivision regulations. Towers can be erected only
on property that complies with the Village's subdivision regulations.
J. Screening and security of towers and accessory structures.
(1) Existing on-site vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum
extent practicable.
(2) The base of the tower and any accessory structures shall be
landscaped.
(3) Towers and accessory structures shall be provided with security
fencing to prevent unauthorized entry.
(4) Lighting of accessory buildings and base areas of antennas may be
restricted by the Board of Trustees.
K. Design of antennas, towers and accessory structures. Towers and
antennas shall be designed to blend into the surrounding environment
through the use of color and camouflaging architectural treatment,
except in instances where the color is dictated by federal or state
authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration. Every antenna
and tower shall be of neutral colors that are harmonious with, and that
blend with, the natural features, buildings and structures surrounding
such antenna and structure and, where appropriate, with the sky;
provided, however, that directional or panel antenna and omnidirectional
or whip antennas located on the exterior of a building that
§ 206-5 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 206-5
206:361
will also serve as an antenna tower shall be of colors that match,
and cause the antenna to blend with, the exterior of the building.
Accessory structures will be designed to be architecturally compatible
with principal structures on the site.
L. Compliance with other laws. Prior to issuance of a special use permit to
the tower owner, and in the case of subsequently added antennas prior
to their installation, the operator of every PWS antenna shall submit to
the Village Manager copies of all licenses and permits required by other
agencies and governments with jurisdiction over the design,
construction, location and operation of such antenna and shall maintain
such licenses and permits and provide evidence of renewal or extension
thereof when granted.
M. Assignment of permit. Every permit granting approval of an antenna or
tower shall state that any assignment or transfer of the permit or any
rights thereunder may be made only with the approval of the Board of
Trustees.
N. Review. The permit shall be subject to review by the Board of Trustees
at five-year intervals to determine whether the technology in the
provision of PWS has changed such that the necessity for the permit at
the time of its approval has been eliminated or modified and whether
the permit should be modified or terminated as a result of any such
change.
O. The applicant for a special use permit under this chapter shall pay to
the Village a fee set by resolution of the Board of Trustees. [Amended
10-7-2003 by L.L. No. 3-2003]
P. Escrow account. The applicant shall provide funds to an escrow
account, in an amount determined by the Board of Trustees, to allow
the Village to retain such technical experts as may be necessary to
review the proposal including, but not limited to, the review of financial
and technical aspects of the proposal and of the financial and technical
practicability of alternatives that may be available to the applicant,
provided that no funds shall be deposited until the scope of work is
agreed upon among the applicant, the expert(s) and the Board of
Trustees.
Q. Abandoned or unused towers. Abandoned or unused towers or portions
of towers shall be removed as follows:
(1) All abandoned or unused towers and associated facilities shall be
removed within 90 days of the cessation of operations at the site
unless a time extension is approved by the Board of Trustees. A
copy of the relevant portions of a signed lease which requires the
applicant to remove the tower and associated facilities upon
cessation of operations at the site shall be submitted at the time of
application, and any renewal or substitute lease must contain such
a provision which shall be submitted to the Board of Trustees.
§ 206-5 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 206-5
206:362
(2) As a condition of granting any special use permit, the Board of
Trustees shall require the applicant to post a bond, in the amount
determined by the Board of Trustees based on engineering
estimates, to cover the costs of removing and disposing of the
tower, antenna and associated facilities. In the event that a tower is
not removed within 90 days of the cessation of operations at a site,
the tower and associated facilities may be removed by the Village
and the costs of removal assessed against the property, the bond or
both.
(3) The owner of the tower shall, within 30 days of the event, notify the
Board of Trustees, in writing, of the cessation of operations at the
site or the removal or cessation of operations of any antenna
located on the tower.
(4) Unused portions of towers above a manufactured connection shall
be removed within 90 days of the time of antenna relocation. The
replacement of portions of a tower previously removed requires the
issuance of a new special use permit.
R. Effect of law on existing towers and antennas. Antennas and towers in
existence which do not conform to or comply with this chapter are
subject to the following provisions:
(1) Antennas and towers may continue in use for the purpose now used
and as now existing but may not be replaced or structurally altered
without complying in all respects with this chapter.
(2) If such antennas or towers are hereafter damaged or destroyed due
to any reason or cause whatsoever, the antenna or tower may be
repaired and restored to its former use, location and physical
dimensions without complying with this chapter; provided,
however, that if the cost of repairing the tower to the former use,
physical dimensions and location would be 10% or more of the cost
of a new tower of like kind and quality, then the tower may not be
repaired or restored except in full compliance with this chapter.
S. Procedural requirements.
(1) The Board of Trustees shall conduct a public hearing within 62
days from the day an application, with supporting material as
required by this chapter or other applicable law, is received. The
Board shall issue a decision within 30 days after the hearing,
except that the time may be extended with the consent of the
applicant or if necessary to complete the State Environmental
Quality Review Act (SEQRA) process. Any denial for a permit under
this chapter shall be in writing and supported by substantial
evidence.
(2) Prior to or concurrent with the filing of a formal application for a
special use permit, the applicant shall submit information needed

ARTICLE I
Street Trees
§ 208-1. Purpose.
The Village of Croton-on-Hudson has a vital interest in the planting and
preservation of trees within its borders. The preservation of trees as defined
herein within the Village is necessary to protect the health, safety and
general welfare of the Village because trees provide shade, impede soil
erosion, aid water absorption and retention, inhibit excess runoff and
flooding, enhance air quality, offer a natural barrier to noise, provide a
natural habitat for wildlife, provide screening, enhance property values and
add to the aesthetic quality of the community.
§ 208-1.1. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following term shall have the meaning indicated:
STREET TREES  Trees, shrubs, bushes and all other woody vegetation on
land lying between property lines on either side of all streets, avenues and
rights-of-way within the Village.
§ 208-2. Designation of official custodian; duties.
The Superintendent of the Department of Public Works, hereinafter also
referred to as the "Department," shall serve as the official custodian of all
street trees and develop, in consultation with the Conservation Advisory
Council, an annual street tree program.
§ 208-3. Duties and responsibilities of Department.
The duties and responsibilities of the Department shall be to:
§ 208-4. Spacing of trees planted.
The spacing of street trees will be in accordance with the following size
classes, and the preferred distances between trees are: small trees, 30
feet; medium trees, 40 feet; and large trees, 50 feet; except in special
plantings designed or approved by the Department in consultation with
the Conservation Advisory Council. Small trees are defined as having an
ultimate height equal to or greater than 13 feet but less than 26 feet;
A. Study the problems and determine the needs of the Village of Crotonon-
Hudson in connection with its street tree program.
B. In consultation with the Conservation Advisory Council, determine the
type and kind of trees to be planted upon Village streets or parts of
Village streets or as designated.
C. Work in conjunction with the Conservation Advisory Council in the
dissemination of news and information regarding selection, planting
and maintenance of trees within Village limits.
§ 208-1 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 208-4
206:365
medium trees are defined as having an ultimate height equal to or greater
than 26 feet but less than 52 feet; and large trees are defined as having an
ultimate height equal to or greater than 52 feet.
§ 208-5. Distance from curbs and sidewalks.
The distance trees may be planted from curbs or curblines and sidewalks
will be in accordance with the species size, with final determination made
by the Department.
§ 208-6. Distance from street corners and hydrants.
No street tree shall generally be planted closer than 35 feet to any street
corner, measured from the point of the nearest intersection curbs or
curblines. No street tree shall be planted closer than 10 feet to any fire
hydrant.
§ 208-7. Distance from utilities.
No street trees may be planted over or within three lateral feet (small or
medium) or five lateral feet (large) of any underground waterline, sewer
line, transmission line or other utility.
§ 208-8. Rights of Village.
§ 208-9. Pruning of trees prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or Village department to prune any
street tree or other trees on public property without written approval from
the Department. "Pruning" is defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to
stubs larger than three inches in diameter to such a degree as to remove the
normal canopy and/or disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storm
or other causes or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions
where other pruning practices are impractical may be exempted from this
article at the determination of the Department.
A. The Village shall have the right to plant, prune, maintain and remove
street trees within the lines of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes,
squares, sidewalks and public grounds, as may be necessary to ensure
public safety or convenience or to preserve or enhance the symmetry
and beauty of such public grounds. The Department may remove or
cause or order to be removed any tree or part thereof which is in an
unsafe condition or which, by reason by its nature, is injurious to
sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, waterlines or other public
improvements or is affected with any injurious fungus, insect or other
pest.
B. This section does not prohibit the planting of street trees by adjacent
property owners, provided that departmental review has been made
and approval granted.
§ 208-4 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 208-10
206:366
§ 208-10. Responsibilities of property owners.
Every owner of any tree or shrub on private property overhanging any rightof-
way within the Village shall prune the branches so that such branches
shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view of
any street intersection or any traffic control device and so that there shall
be a clear space of eight feet above the surface of the street or sidewalk.
Said owners shall remove all dead, diseased or dangerous trees or broken
or decayed limbs which constitute a menace to the safety of the public.
The Department shall have the right to prune any tree or shrub on private
property when it interferes with the proper spread of light along the street
from a streetlight or interferes with visibility of any traffic control device or
sign or interferes with visibility at an intersection.
§ 208-11. Removal of stumps.
All stumps of street trees shall be removed below the surface of the ground
so that the top of the stump shall not project above the surface of the
ground.
§ 208-12. Removal of healthy trees prohibited.
In order to protect the Village's investment in time and resources in the
street tree program, it shall be unlawful to remove or cause the destruction
of any healthy street tree without prior approval of the Department.
§ 208-13. Consent required for deviations.
Any deviation from this article shall be unlawful without the express written
consent of the Superintendent of the Department.
§ 208-10 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 208-13

ARTICLE II
Tree Preservation
§ 208-14. Purpose.
§ 208-15. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPLICANT  Any individual or individuals, firm, partnership, association,
corporation, company, organization or other legal entity of any kind,
including a municipal corporation, governmental agency or subdivision
thereof, filing an application pursuant to this chapter.
APPROVING AUTHORITY  The Village Engineer or his or her designee or
the Planning Board or Village Board as applicable, as specified in § 208-16C
hereof.
CLEAR CUTTING  The cutting of more than 10 trees with a DBH of four
inches or greater on a lot, within any twelve-month period.
DIAMETER AT BREAST HEIGHT (DBH)  The diameter of a tree measured
at a point 4 1/2 feet above the ground, or at the highest measurable point of
the remaining stump if less than 4 1/2 feet, on the uphill side of the tree.
LANDMARK TREES  A tree as defined on a list of trees which may be
promulgated and established by the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson, which list is on file in the office of the Village Manager.
A. The Board of Trustees finds that it has been established that trees
stabilize the soil and control water pollution by preventing soil erosion
and flooding, reduce air pollution, provide oxygen, yield advantageous
microclimatic effects, temper noise and, further, that unusual, large and
old trees have unique aesthetic and historic values. Indiscriminate
removal of trees causes deprivation of these benefits and disrupts the
Village's ecological systems. It is, therefore, the purpose of this article
to prevent the indiscriminate or unnecessary destruction of trees within
the Village of Croton-on-Hudson.
B. The Village, furthermore, takes note of the findings of the New York
State Environmental Quality Review Act,97 among them being the
obligation of the Village to serve as a steward of air, water, land and
living resources and the obligation to protect the environment for the
use of this and further generations. It is the intent of the Village to
recognize these responsibilities in part by providing these procedures
as well as to preserve the health and welfare and rural character of the
community which is reflected in the woodlands of the Village of Crotonon-
Hudson.
97.Editor's Note: See Art. 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 208-14 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 208-15
206:369
LOT  Any parcel of land, not necessarily coincident with a lot or lots shown
on a map of record, which is occupied or which is to be occupied by a
building and its accessory buildings, if any, or by a group of buildings having
any land in common and the buildings accessory thereto, if any, together
with the required open spaces appurtenant to such building or group of
buildings.
REGULATED BUFFER ZONE  Any area of vegetative screening as
established by an approved site plan, minor site plan, special permit or
subdivision plat, or any area of a residentially zoned property as measured
from each perimeter property line of the property towards the interior of
such property as follows:
Zoning District
Width of Regulated Buffer Zone
(feet)
RA-40 15

TREE  A living woody plant with an erect perennial trunk which is four
inches or more in DBH.
§ 208-16. Tree removal permit required; approving authority.
A. General regulations. A tree removal permit will be required before
removing:
(1) Any tree eight inches or more in DBH on any parcel of land capable
of being subdivided under the zoning provisions applicable to the
district in which the parcel is situated or on any parcel of land
without a residential structure or on any property which would
require site plan approval to be developed.
(2) Any tree four inches or more in DBH growing on slopes of over
20%.
(3) Any threatened or endangered species of tree, regardless of size,
as defined by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation.
(4) Landmark trees as herein defined, regardless of size.
(5) Any tree four inches or more in DBH, the trunk of which is wholly or
partially located in a regulated buffer zone as herein defined.
§ 208-15 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 208-16
206:370
(6) More than 10 trees with a DBH of four inches or greater on a lot,
within any twelve-month period.
B. Exceptions.
(1) No tree removal permit shall be required for work to be done by or
on behalf of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson.
(2) Trees may be removed by the appropriate agency or authority as
may be necessary to maintain Village, county, state or utility rightof-
way, as a control measure to fight forest or other fires or under
such other actual or ongoing emergency condition when such tree
removal is essential for the protection and preservation of life or
property.
C. Approving authority. The approving authority for all applications shall
be the Village Engineer or his or her designee, except that the Planning
Board or Village Board, as applicable, shall be the approving authority
for any application that is also the subject of a pending site plan, minor
site plan, subdivision approval, wetlands permit or steep slopes permit
in accordance with the requirements of the Code of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson. Except as otherwise required in connection with the
review of subdivision and site plan applications by the Planning Board
and steep slope applications by the Village Board, the application for a
tree removal permit shall not be subject to a public hearing, and
notification of adjoining or other property owners is not required.
D. Standards for the granting of permits. A tree removal permit shall
normally be issued if any of the following conditions are met:
(1) The location of the tree(s) clearly endangers the health, safety,
welfare or property of the general public, the property owner or an
adjoining property owner.
(2) The location of the designated tree(s) prevents compliance with
state, county or local standards for sight lines, driveways or
intersections.
(3) The location of the tree(s) prevents the property owner from
undertaking otherwise approved construction or alteration because
the location of the designated tree(s) substantially interferes with a
permitted use of the property and the construction or alteration
cannot be reasonably modified to accommodate the designated
tree(s); written explanation may be required describing how the
designated tree(s) interferes with construction or alteration and
why the construction or alteration cannot be modified reasonably
to accommodate the designated tree(s).
(4) The designated tree(s), due to death, disease, blight, infestation,
storm damage, accident or other condition, causes undue hardship
for the property owner to maintain.
§ 208-16 TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 208-16
206:371
§ 208-17. Permit application.
(5) The tree is dead, or so substantially diseased that it constitutes a
danger to persons, property or other trees.
(6) The removal of the tree is not inconsistent with good silvicultural,
horticultural or vegetation management and will not have an
adverse visual or ecological impact.
E. Planning Board or Village Board action which is deemed approval of
tree removal. Where tree removal is proposed in connection with any
site plan, minor site plan, subdivision plat, wetlands permit or steep
slope permit application submitted or to be submitted to the Planning
Board or Village Board, as applicable, trees shall be removed from the
affected property only in conjunction with an approved final subdivision
plat, final site plan, minor site plan, wetlands or steep slope permit
application. A tree removal permit is not required in these cases.
A. Any person proposing to conduct or cause to be conducted a regulated
activity specified in § 208-16 hereof shall file an application for a permit
with the approving authority as hereinafter provided. Such application
shall include the following information:
(1) The name and address of the applicant.
(2) The address and Village Tax Map designation of the property on
which the tree(s) is/are located.
(3) The total land area involved in cutting operations.
(4) The number and size in DBH of trees to be removed.
(5) The purpose of the tree removal.
(6) A survey of that section to be disturbed, showing location of any

disturbance of 100 or more acres and where an acceptable erosion and
sedimentation control plan has been or will be prepared for such
project and where an environmental impact statement has been or will
be prepared for such project, a sampling technique may be used to
estimate the number, species and diameter of trees on the site and the
number of trees proposed to be removed. The specifics of the sampling
technique shall be subject to the approval of the Planning Board.
Notwithstanding the above, all trees 22 inches in diameter at breast
height and greater in any areas proposed to be disturbed shall be
individually identified and marked in accordance with §§ 208-17A and
208-18C, respectively, of this article.

frequently are able to evade existing enforcement measures.

welfare, and safety of the Village will be served by adoption of a
Village local law providing additional means of enforcing parking
orders, rules, regulations, and local laws in the case of vehicle
owners who fail to timely respond to summonses issued for Village
parking violations.

§ 223-5. Service connections and charges.
at least 72 hours before the work is to be commenced. All work
to be done must be inspected and approved by the Superintendent
of the Department of Public Works or his representative prior to
acceptance. In the case of service connections which are larger
than one inch, applications must be returned to the Village
Engineer, properly completed, at least 15 days prior to the
commencement of work (excluding Saturdays, Sundays and
holidays).
(2) The application constitutes a binding obligation on the part of the
applicant, and each applicant agrees to be bound by all rules,
regulations and laws of the Village and the Department now in
force and/or which may from time to time be adopted.
B. All fees for water service connections must be paid in advance. Prior to
any work being performed in the street right-of-way, all other required
permits shall be obtained from the appropriate agency.
A. Each premises in single ownership must be provided with a water
service connection with no more than one water service connection per
premises. Each water service connection must be metered.
B. Work in connection with the tapping of mains and/or waterlines of the
Village water district (up to two inches in size) must in all cases be
performed by employees of the Department. Work in connection with
the installation of water service connections between the mains and the
street (lot) lines must in all cases be performed under the supervision of
employees of the Department. For service connections greater than two
inches, the property owner shall assume the cost of the tapping sleeve,
valve installation and service connections from the main to the street
(lot) lines, with all work to be performed under the supervision of the
employees of the Department. In all cases, the owner of the property is

mains is the domain of the Water Department. The owner must secure a
qualified licensed plumber for all work performed between the main
and the curb stop. The curb box shall be located no further than three
feet from the edge of pavement (or curb where curbs are in place). In
the case where the water main is located between the edge of pavement
(or curb where curbs are in place) and the property line, the curb box
shall be located as close to the main as practicable, but in any case
between the main and the property line. In all cases where a curb box is
improperly located on private property, the Water Department shall not
be responsible for the repair and maintenance of the service line
beyond the proper curb box location, even though no curb box may be
in place at the proper location. Upon completion of designated work
and prior to backfilling of trenches, all work must be inspected and
approved by the Superintendent of the Department of Public Works or
his designated representative.

§ 223-6. Meter installation and charges.
C. The service line from the curb stop to the buildings shall be installed
and maintained entirely by the owner at a depth of not less than 42
inches but not greater than 48 inches. All pipe that is installed from the
curb stop to the water main must be of Type K copper in conformance
with the Department-installed standards. Such service line shall be not
less than 3/4 inch in inside diameter. Each service line must be installed
in accordance with the Department's water service installation
diagram.
D. Whenever an existing water service connection is to be replaced or
abandoned, the existing water service connection is to be removed in its
entirety and the connection to the main shut off by the Department,
with all work being at the owner's expense.
E. All owners, contractors or plumbers are required to notify the
Department, in writing, whenever they are renewing or repairing a
customer's service line. After due notification of a leak in that portion of
the service line for which the owner is responsible, such leak shall be
repaired within 72 hours, or the owner will be subject to the penalties
prescribed under § 223-13 hereof.
F. Fire-protection systems must be designed, installed and maintained in
conformity with National Fire Protection Association (NFPA)
regulations and other applicable regulations.
A. All water must be supplied by meter measurement except for private
fire hydrants and/or fire sprinkler service except if required by the
Department. If a meter is required for a private hydrant and/or fire
sprinkler service, then the owner must furnish, install and maintain
such meter at no cost to the Village or Department.
B. Meters up to a maximum size of 1 1/2 inches shall be furnished by and
shall remain the property of the Village. Approved meters over the
prescribed maximum size shall be furnished, installed and maintained
by the owner at the owner's expense.
C. All meters must be installed by the owner or licensed plumber at his or
her own expense. Replacement meters up to a maximum size of 1 1/2
inches will be furnished by and installed by the Department.
Replacement meters above the prescribed maximum size shall be
furnished, installed and maintained by the owner at the owner's
expense. Shutoff valves must be placed on the outlet side and on the
inlet side of all water meters. These valves must be installed within two
feet of the water meter. Meters shall be installed and located where
they are not subject to freezing and are readily accessible for removal
by Department personnel. All meters shall be installed in accordance
with the Department's water service installation diagram or plan
approved by the Village Engineer. In no case shall any branch line or
§ 223-5 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 223-6
219:439
any form of outlet be connected to the service at any point between the
main and the meter.
D. Meters must be accessible to and subject to the control of the
Department at all times. No one other than employees of the
Department shall move or interfere with the operation of the meter
except by permission of the Department. When meters are sealed, the
seal may be broken only by an employee of the Department. Should the
seal be broken other than by an employee of the Department, the owner
will be held fully responsible, and the Department reserves the right to
order the meter removed for testing at the expense of the owner. The
charge for this test shall be that which is in force at the time of test.
E. Where the building to be served is located more than 50 feet from the
curb stop, the Department may require the meter to be placed at an
approved point outside the building in a meter vault approved by the
Department. It is the responsibility of the owner to maintain the meter
vault in a condition of good repair and free from all debris so that the
meter can be easily read. The meter vault must be approved by the
Superintendent of the Department of Public Works or his designee prior
to the installation of the meter.
F. All work in connection with the maintenance of meters up to a
maximum size of 1 1/2 inches will be performed by the Department; all
other must be maintained by the owner. If a meter is out of order or fails
to register the water consumption properly, it will be changed or
repaired as heretofore stipulated. Damage to meters caused by
negligence of the consumer or owner will be charged to the owner; this
includes frozen meters and meters damaged by hot water. All water that
passes through the meter will be charged to the owner, whether the
water is legitimately used or wasted through leakage.
G. In the case of a disputed account involving the accuracy of a meter,
such meter shall be tested, if within the Department's jurisdiction, upon
a request of the owner or consumer. All meter testing shall be paid for
by the owner/consumer and payment shall be made at the time the
request for the testing is made. In the event that the meter so tested
upon a request of the owner/consumer is found to have an error in
registration (more than 3%, plus or minus), the bill will be increased or
decreased accordingly, but no retroactive reimbursement shall be made
to the owner/consumer for previous billing period(s). If the meter is
found to be over-registering by more than the aforesaid allowable rate,
then the cost of the test shall be borne by the Department, and the
amount paid for the test shall be returned to the owner or consumer. If
the meter so tested shall be found to have no error in registration (less
than 3%, plus or minus) the payment shall be retained by the
Department as compensation for such test. The fee for testing of meters
shall be set by resolution by the Board of Trustees.113

such notice or less than 24 hours' notice is provided, then the
Department may charge a meter reading fee. Said fee shall be

any cessation in registration of the meter as soon as it comes to his
knowledge.

the Village's current meter reading system and be approved by the
Village prior to the installation of the meter. The location of all meters is
subject to approval by the Superintendent of the Department of Public
Works or his designated representative.
K. Any person molesting or tampering or interfering with the proper
registration of a meter or utilizing a bypass around the meter shall be
subject to penalties prescribed under § 223-13 hereof.

notification or be subject to a penalty as provided for in § 223-13 hereof.
A. The Department shall extend water mains only when they are within the
corporate limits of the Village and when such extensions will improve
the distribution system. All other extensions will be installed by the
applicant for a water connection, with no expense to the Village, and in
accordance with all applicable rules and regulations. The office of the
Village Engineer reserves the right to employ an inspector at the
owner's expense to ensure that installation is in accordance with
specifications and regulations governing the installation.
B. A plan of the proposed water main extensions, showing all hydrants and
valves, must be submitted to the office of the Village Engineer for
approval. This plan must be approved prior to the installation of the
main.

recordation.
G. The applicant shall guarantee the entire installation for a period of 12
months following the official acceptance of the extension, and shall
make all necessary repairs that might be necessitated during this
twelve-month period. In the case of any emergency where Department
personnel perform repair work, the applicant shall repay the Village for
said work.

with an as-built plan, together with an acceptable maintenance bond in
an amount to be determined by the Village Manager and in a form
approved by the Village Attorney.

water service can be initiated.
B. Once issued, the owner must assume responsibility for the water meter
under all circumstances, with the exception of mechanical failure. If
mechanical failure occurs, the owner will be held liable if the
mechanical failure was precipitated by any external influence on the
water meter.

reader or transmitter must be installed and the curb box must be plumb
and accessible.
A. Each building containing a sprinkler system shall be charged an

§ 223-7 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 223-9
219:442
§ 223-10. Miscellaneous regulations.
the Department of Public Works shall designate the exact hydrant to
be used and stipulate the dates and times within which water may
be drawn. A deposit, in an amount set by resolution of the Board of
Trustees, will be required before such permit will be issued. In addition
to the deposit, a fee in an amount set by resolution of the Board of
Trustees shall be paid in advance for the estimated quantity of water
to be drawn from the hydrant. After the applicant has withdrawn the
water, the deposit will be returned to the applicant if, after examination,
the hydrant is found not to have been damaged and is in good working
order. If the hydrant is found to have been damaged, the expense of
repairing the hydrant will be deducted from the deposit. If damage
exceeds the amount of deposit, the amount will be assessed in addition
to cover cost of repairs. Permits may be revoked at any time at the
discretion of the Department.
C. Any person opening or operating any public or private hydrant without
proper authorization shall be subject to the penalties under § 223-13
hereof.
A. Shutoff of water for violation of rules. The water may be shut off to an
owner or consumer failing to comply with this article and/or the rules
and regulations of the Department adopted in implementation thereof
and will not be turned on again until satisfactory assurance is given that
the article and/or rules and regulations will be complied with and all
proper and necessary expense incurred in shutting off and turning on of
the water is paid in full. If the Department determines that a shutoff is
warranted, the Department will send the owner or consumer notice
outlining the outstanding rates and penalties that are due and notifying
him or her that water service will be shut off if all outstanding charges
are not paid within 5 days of receiving the notice. Within that five-day
period, the owner or consumer will be afforded the opportunity to
contest the Department's grounds for the shutoff.
B. Temporary shutoff. If the Water Department determines that service
must be temporarily shut off for any reason, the Department will
provide affected owners and consumers with at least 24 hours' advance
notice, except in emergencies. In such cases, there shall be a fee for
such service, in an amount set by resolution of the Board of Trustees.
C. Emergency shutoff of water. Should it become necessary to shut off the
water supply due to a break in the water main or for other reasons of an
emergency nature, the Department shall have the right to temporarily
shut off the water supply for the duration of the emergency until the
repairs are made or the emergency is over without providing advance
notice to affected consumers; however, the Department will use all
reasonable and practicable measures to notify the consumers in
advance of such discontinuation of service. When an emergency shutoff
is required, the Department shall not be liable for any damage or
inconvenience suffered by the consumer as a result of the shutoff.
§ 223-9 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 223-10
219:443
D. Liability of Village.

any other consequences beyond its control.
(2) The Village (including its employees and agents) shall not be liable
for any damages which may result to an owner's or consumer's

service pipes for any purpose whatever, whether previous notice
has been given or not. No deductions from water bills will be made
for periods when the service is shut off.
E. Cross-connections. No connection from any other sources of water
supply to any system of piping supplied by the Department shall be
made or maintained at any time and all rules of Section 5-1.3.1 of Part 5
of the New York State Sanitary Code (as it may be amended or
supplemented from time to time) shall apply with regard to backflow
valves. Consumers having independent or auxiliary systems shall
maintain that system completely independent of the municipal supply at
all times. No interconnection of the water supply of this Department is
permitted with any pipe or structure which contains liquids, chemicals,
unsafe or otherwise unsatisfactory water or any other contaminating
substances except when such interconnection is installed and protected
in a manner satisfactory to the Department.
F. Access to property. The Superintendent of the Department of Public
Works and all employees under his jurisdiction shall have free access at

the curb stop. The consumer shall at all times comply with state and
municipal regulations in reference to these pipes and shall make any
change thereon required on account of change of grade, relocation of
mains or otherwise.
H. Operation of valves. No person other than an employee of the

J. Waste of water. A consumer shall maintain his faucets, toilets and
service lines and all appurtenances in good working order and
condition and free of all leaks at his own expense in order to conserve
water. All water that passes through the meter will be charged to the
owner, whether the water is legitimately used or wasted through
leakage.

water used by consumers in case of scarcity or whenever the public
welfare may require it.
B. Whenever it shall be determined by the Village Manager that a state of
emergency exists by reason of drought or damage to the public water
supply system, or that there is an insufficient supply of water or that the
water supply system is endangered by any other cause, then he or she
shall be empowered to make it unlawful to use water from the Village
water supply system for any or all of the following uses as determined

ARTICLE II
Water Supply Protection
[Adopted 7-24-1989 by L.L. No. 5-1989]
§ 223-15. Contents.
The following constitutes the Water Supply Protection Rules and
Regulations of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson.
§ 223-16. Purpose.
§ 223-17. Groundwater zones.
A. The Village of Croton-on-Hudson's water supply is obtained from sand
and gravel deposits laid down in the Croton River Valley. This valley-fill
aquifer is the primary source of drinking water for the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson and is located in the northern portion of the village.
The area which contributes water to this aquifer includes parts of both
the Village of Croton-on-Hudson and the Town of Cortlandt.
B. River valley aquifers usually underlie the river and form a band on
either side of the stream. These bands extend for varying distances
upstream of smaller tributaries. Groundwater flow in valley-fill aquifers
is generally toward the river which forms the discharge point.
Groundwater flow patterns are modified by pumping wells which create
a cone of influence.
C. Pollution of groundwater is more difficult to clean up than pollution of
surface water. Groundwater is afforded little dilution because of the
laminar flow which resists mixing and because of the slow movement.
Where water is withdrawn from the ground and then returned for
disposal, as with subsurface sewage disposal, contaminants accumulate
in the groundwater.
D. Normal domestic activities, both residential and commercial, result in
the discharge, on a widespread basis, of small quantities of
nondegradable metals, salts, hydrocarbons, nitrates and other toxic
substances. Even small quantities of soluble organic chemical
substances, when discharged at or below the land surface, can migrate
to the water table and seriously contaminate the groundwater.
Limitations of future developmental density and strict management of
the use of the land in the Village of Croton-on-Hudson and the Town of
Cortlandt, specifically in the areas adjacent to the Croton River and the
well field, are essential to control potential pollutants and prevent
degradation of drinking water quality.
E. The purpose of this Article is to preserve, protect and maintain the
existing purity and quality of the groundwater within the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson. It will establish protective land use regulations for
the watershed affecting the well field.
§ 223-15 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 223-17
219:449
A. There are three zones affecting the quality of the aquifer, and a degree
of regulation or management for each is required if the water supply
source is to be protected from contamination. The three zones are
defined as follows and are hereby established in the map entitled
"Zones of Groundwater Protection, Croton-on-Hudson Well Field,"
which is hereby made a part of this Article and is to be kept on file in the
Village Office of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson. [Amended 5-7-1990
by L.L. No. 2-1990]
(1) Zone 1: the wellhead protection area, including the cone of
influence.
(2) Zone 2: the recharge area of the aquifer.
(3) Zone 3: the watershed area tributary to the recharge area.
B. This three-zone system will be superimposed on existing land use
zones. The requirements of the underlying districts shall continue to
apply. Permitted uses, except where prohibited by this Article, shall also
continue to apply. In the event of conflict between this Article and any
other regulation, the more restrictive requirements shall control.
C. The wellhead protection area is defined to be Zone 1 in the map entitled
"Zones of Groundwater Protection, Croton-on-Hudson Well Field" and
includes at a minimum the area within 200 feet of the well and the cone
of influence. [Amended 5-7-1990 by L.L. No. 2-1990]
D. The cone of influence is created when the drawdown caused by
pumping of the groundwater creates a pressure gradient which induces
a flow of groundwater toward the well. Any contaminant that reaches
the groundwater within this cone of influence will be drawn to the well.
This cone of influence may cause a disruption of the normal
groundwater flow patterns because water normally flowing parallel to
the well or downgradient from the well may be directed toward the
well.
E. Additional protection is needed for groundwater supplies, which are
vulnerable to contaminant-generating activities outside the wellhead
protection area, such as area and river valley aquifers where the
waterbearing formations extend to the surface. Controls over the
recharge area and the watershed tributary (surface water) to the
recharge area are needed.
F. The recharge area is the area where precipitation rapidly infiltrates into
the ground and into an aquifer where it will flow towards the point(s) of
withdrawal. Such aquifers are characterized by water-bearing deposits
of sand and gravel with high permeability and porosity. Any
contaminant-producing activity in this area will travel rapidly to the
groundwater.
G. River valley aquifers are replenished not only by direct infiltration of
precipitation but also by runoff from that portion of the watershed
§ 223-17 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 223-17
219:450
§ 223-18. Sources of contamination.
tributary to the recharge area, an area composed of relatively
impervious consolidated and unconsolidated material. Typically, runoff
flows overland and in defined stream beds until reaching the recharge
area where it seeps underground. In large streams, water may flow
through the recharge area in times of high water tables and high flows.
The large stream will generally have a continuous flow of water. The
exchange between surface and ground water will take place either to
the stream or to the aquifer, depending upon water conditions, the
location of withdrawal points and the relative size of withdrawals.
A. Water supply sources are subjected to contaminants from the following
sources:
(1) Wastewater discharges to surface and ground water.
(2) Improper handling and disposal of waste material.
(3) Improper handling, storage and use of materials which are or may
be contaminating.
(4) Accidental spills of contaminating material from storage, during
transit or during use.
(5) Water, land and air resource use which may adversely affect water
quality.
B. Public water supply sources have been contaminated in numerous
instances because of systems, facilities and activities which were not
properly managed or were not appropriately located in relation to
public water supply sources. The people of the State of New York have a
right to expect and the New York State Commissioner of Health and
Westchester County Commissioner of Health are obligated to see that
every reasonable precaution and measure is taken to protect water
supply sources from contamination and that safe drinking water is
available from public water supply sources and systems. [Amended
5-7-1990 by L.L. No. 2-1990]
C. The aquifer protection is hereby extended over the entire watershed as
delineated in the map entitled "Zones of Groundwater Protection,
Croton-on-Hudson Well Field". The severest restrictions apply to Zone
1, and the least severe restrictions apply to Zone 3. With additional
research, the zone boundaries may change. In this case, the criteria
used to set up the boundaries shall control. [Amended 5-7-1990 by
L.L. No. 2-1990]
D. In order to assure the adequate protection of sources of public water
supply, the Village of Croton-on-Hudson institutes the promulgation of
the following regulations.
§ 223-17 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 223-19
219:451

A. This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Waterfront Revitalization of Coastal Resources and Inland
Waterways Act of the State of New York (Article 42 of the Executive
Law).
B. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a framework for agencies to
consider the policies and purposes contained in the Village of Crotonon-
Hudson LWRP when reviewing applications for actions or direct
actions located in the Village coastal area and to ensure that such
actions are consistent with said LWRP policies, and whenever
practicable will advance one or more of them.
C. It is the intention of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson that the
preservation, enhancement and utilization of the natural and man-made
resources of the coastal area of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson take
place in a comprehensive manner to ensure a proper balance between
protection of natural resources and the need to accommodate
population growth and economic development. Accordingly, this
chapter is intended to achieve such a balance, permitting the beneficial
use of coastal resources while preventing the following: loss of living
estuarine resources and wildlife; diminution of open space areas and of
public access to the waterfront; erosion of shoreline; impairment of
water quality and scenic beauty; losses due to flooding, erosion and
sedimentation; or permanent adverse changes to ecological systems.

forthcoming within the specified time, the lead agency shall make
its determination of consistency without the benefit of the WAC's
recommendation of consistency.
C. Upon receipt of the WAC's recommendation of consistency, the lead
agency shall consider whether the proposed action is consistent with
the LWRP policies. The lead agency shall consider the WAC's
recommendation of consistency, the CAF and other relevant
information in making its determination of consistency. No approval or
decision shall be rendered for an action in the coastal area without a
determination of consistency having first been adopted by the lead
§ 225-6 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 225-6
219:474
agency. The lead agency shall circulate its determination to all other
involved agencies.
D. Where an environmental impact statement (EIS) is being prepared or
required, the draft EIS must identify applicable LWRP policies and
include a discussion of the effects and impacts of the proposed action
on such policies.

§ 227-1. Legislative findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Croton-on-Hudson finds that growth
of population and attendant residential and commercial development and
increasing demands upon natural resources have the potential of
encroaching upon, despoiling, polluting or eliminating many of the
wetlands, water bodies and watercourses of the Village which, if preserved,
constitute important physical, economic, social, historic, archaeological,
aesthetic, recreational and ecological assets to present and future residents
of the Village and provide important beneficial functions, including natural
flood and stormwater control, groundwater recharge, natural pollution
treatment, erosion and sediment control, wildlife habitat creation,
recreation and open space enhancement and educational opportunities.
§ 227-2. Legislative intent.
It is the intent of this chapter to protect the public interest, general health,
safety, economic and general welfare of the citizens of the Village by
providing for the protection, preservation, proper maintenance and use of
its wetlands, water bodies and watercourses by preventing damage from
erosion or siltation, minimizing disturbance, preserving natural habitats
and protecting against flood and pollution and otherwise protecting the
quality of such areas for their conservation, economic, aesthetic,
recreational and other public uses and values. Further, it is the intent
of this chapter to protect the surface water and groundwater resources
wholly and partly within the Village from the threat of pollution, misuse
or mismanagement. Therefore, because all wetlands, water bodies and
watercourses are presumed to be of importance, it is hereby declared that
the regulation of wetland and wetland buffer areas of the Village, as defined
in § 227-3 of this chapter and as this chapter becomes effective relative
to any specific area as described herein, is essential to the health, safety,
economic and general welfare of the citizens of the Village.

§ 227-8. Considerations in granting permit; mitigation plans;
monitoring; issuance of permits; security.
A. In making its determination to grant, deny or grant with modifications
and/or conditions a permit under this chapter, the approving authority
shall consider the following:
(1) Whether the proposed activity is consistent with the findings and
intent of this chapter as set forth in §§ 227-1 and 227-2 hereof.
(2) Whether the proposed activity will have an environmental impact
and the extent of that impact.
(3) Whether there are possible or practicable alternatives to the
proposed activity.
(4) Whether the proposed activity will have a deleterious effect on the
health, safety or welfare of the residents of the Village or its
neighboring communities.
(5) Whether the proposed activity will have adequate safeguards for
the protection and preservation of the environment and the
wetlands, and for the natural functions of and benefits derived from
such areas.
(6) Whether the proposed activity will have adequate safeguards
employing the best available technology to protect the surface
water and groundwater supplies of the Village from drought,
pollution, overuse and other forms of misuse.
(7) Whether the proposed activity has been planned or designed so as
to create minimal disturbance; to prevent or mitigate damage from
erosion, turbidity or siltation; to preserve the natural flora and
fauna and their habitat; to protect against flood and pollution of the
wetlands; and to protect any other benefits of wetlands as
enumerated in §§ 227-1 and 227-2 hereof; and is the best
practicable alternative available for accomplishing the proposed
action.
(8) Whether there is a practicable alternative site for the proposed
activity in another area of the subject property that is not a
wetland.
(9) Any additional information as contained in:
(a) Any report from other Village boards and agencies and/or
federal, state or other local governmental agencies.
(b) Any additional requested information.
B. The applicant shall have the burden of demonstrating that the proposed
activity is not adverse to the health, safety and welfare of the residents
of the Village or its neighboring communities and that it will not
§ 227-8 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 227-8
219:489
degrade the environment or be inconsistent with the purpose of this
chapter as stated in §§ 227-1 and 227-2 hereof or, in the alternative,
that the applicant will otherwise suffer undue hardship if a permit is not
issued.
C. The approving authority may require the preparation of a mitigation
plan by the applicant pursuant to § 227-8E hereof when the applicant
has demonstrated that either losses or significant impacts to the
wetlands or wetlands buffer are necessary and unavoidable. For the
purposes of requiring a mitigation plan, wetlands impacts are
necessary and unavoidable only if all of the following criteria are
satisfied:
(1) There is no feasible on-site alternative to the proposed activity,
including reduction in density, change in use, revision of road and
lot layout and related site planning considerations that could
accomplish the applicant's objectives; and
(2) There is no feasible alternative to the proposed activity on another
site available to the applicant that is not a wetlands or wetlands
buffer.
D. The approving authority shall monitor or shall cause to have monitored
projects in accordance with the specifications set forth in the permit to
determine whether the elements of the permit and/or mitigation plan
have been met. The Planning Board may contract with an academic
institution, independent research group or other qualified professionals
to assist and discharge its obligations hereunder at the expense of the
applicant. The requirements for monitoring shall be specified in the
permit and/or mitigation plan and may include, but not be limited to:
(1) The time period over which monitoring shall occur.

specified in the permit and/or mitigation plan.
E. In the event that the approving authority so requires pursuant to
§ 227-8C hereof, the applicant shall prepare a mitigation plan.
(1) All mitigation measures shall balance the benefits of regaining new
wetlands areas with the loss to other natural areas caused by
wetlands creation. On-site mitigation shall be the preferred
approach; off-site mitigation shall be permitted only in cases where
an on-site alternative is not possible.
(2) Mitigation plans developed to compensate for the loss of wetlands
or wetlands buffers shall include baseline data as needed to
adequately review the effectiveness of this plan. The mitigation
§ 227-8 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 227-8
219:490
plan shall also include a monitoring schedule for a specified period
of time as agreed to by the approving authority.
(3) Any mitigation plan prepared pursuant to this section and accepted
by the approving authority shall become part of the permit for the
application.
F. Any permit issued pursuant to this chapter may be issued with
conditions. Such conditions may be attached as the approving authority
deems necessary to ensure the preservation and protection of affected
wetlands and to ensure compliance with the policies and provisions of

authority shall be stated.
(3) The permit holder shall notify the approving authority of the date
on which the work is to begin at least five days in advance of such
commencement date.
(4) The approving authority's permit shall be prominently displayed at
the project site during the undertaking of the activities authorized
by the permit.
H. The approving authority shall include in the permit application file it
keeps a copy of any mitigation plan prepared pursuant to § 227-8E
hereof and a record of any hearing held pursuant to § 227-7J hereof.
I. The Planning Board, as the approving authority, may require prior to
the commencement of work authorized under any permit issued
pursuant to this chapter that the applicant shall post a bond or other
security acceptable to the Board of Trustees in an amount and with
surety and conditions sufficient to secure compliance with the
conditions and limitations set forth in the permit. The particular amount
and the conditions of the bond or other security shall be consistent with
the purposes of this chapter. The bond or other security shall remain in
effect until the issuance of a certificate of completion as described in
§ 227-12 hereof and until the bond or other security is released by the
Planning Board or a substitute bond or other security is provided. In the
event that any condition of any such bond or other security is breached,
the Planning Board, as the approving authority, may recommend that
the Village institute an action in the courts upon such bond or other
security and prosecute the same to judgment and execution.

J. No permit granted pursuant to this chapter shall remove an applicant's
obligation to comply in all respects with the applicable provisions of any
other federal, state or local law or regulation, including but not limited
to the securing of any other required permit or approval.
K. The approving authority after notice to the permit holder and an
opportunity to be heard may revoke or suspend a wetlands permit if it
finds that the applicant has not complied with any or all of the terms of
such permit, has exceeded the authority granted in the permit or has
failed to undertake the project in the manner set forth in the approved
application. [Amended 7-21-2008 by L.L. No. 2-2008]
(1) Issuance of a stop-work order by the Village Engineer shall be as
provided in § 86-14 of the Village Code. A stop-work order may be
appealed by filing a written notice of appeal with the Planning

order upon the applicant. A hearing shall be scheduled by the
Planning Board within 20 days of receipt of request for a hearing.
After the close of the hearing, the Planning Board may confirm,
modify or cancel the stop-work order.
(2) The approving authority shall set forth, in writing, in the permit
application file it keeps its findings and reasons for revoking or
suspending a permit pursuant to this section.
L. No permit shall be valid for more than one year after approval of an
application by the approving authority unless otherwise specified by the
approving authority. All permits shall expire upon the completion of the
work specified therein. The validity of any work duly completed
pursuant to an existing permit shall not be affected by the expiration of
the permit, but such work shall not be continued beyond the expiration
date. Permits may be renewed by the approving authority upon
application submitted at least 60 days before the expiration of the
permit. Standards for issuance of renewals shall be the same as for the
issuance of permits. Permits, including all of their conditions, shall be
binding on successors and assignees of the applicant.
A. A determination by the Planning Board to grant or deny a wetlands
permit may be reviewed by the applicant or any other aggrieved person
by the commencement of an action pursuant to the provisions of Article
78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.

or the Village Engineer, the applicant or any other party aggrieved by
such determination may seek review by appealing to the Planning
Board, in which case the Planning Board shall become the approving
authority for such application. Such review shall be requested not later
than 20 days after the filing of the subject decision by the approving
authority.

the Planning Board or their designated representatives. The applicant, by
making application for such permit, shall be deemed to have given its
consent to such inspection. The applicant shall indemnify and hold the
Village harmless against any damage or injury that may be caused by or
arise out of any entry onto the subject property in connection with the
processing of the application, during construction or performance of the
work or within one year after the completion of work.
§ 227-11. Exemptions.
This chapter shall not apply to any work shown on construction drawings or

offense, punishable by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than
$1,000. For a second and each subsequent offense, the violator shall be
§ 227-10 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 227-13

the Village in any court of competent jurisdiction. Such civil penalty
may be released or compromised by the Village, and any action
commenced to recover the same may be settled and discontinued by the
Village.
C. The Planning Board also shall have the power, following a hearing, to
direct a violator to cease violation of this chapter and, under the
Board's supervision, to restore satisfactorily the affected wetland or
wetlands buffer to its condition prior to the violation, insofar as that is

to coincide with the center lines of streets, alleys, parkways,

the property lines of parks or other publicly owned lands, such lines
shall be construed to be such boundaries.
(3) Unless otherwise shown, such boundaries running parallel to
streets shall be construed to be 100 feet back therefrom.

boundary and more than 50% of the area of such lot lies in the less
restricted district, the regulations prescribed by this chapter for
the less restricted district shall apply to such portion of the more
restricted district. For the purposes of this section, the more
restricted district shall be deemed that district which is subject to
regulations which either prohibit the particular uses permitted in
the district covering the remaining portion of said lot or which
regulations require higher standards with respect to setback,
coverage, yards, screening, landscaping and similar requirements.
(5) In all cases where a district boundary line is located not farther
than 15 feet away from a lot line of record, such boundary shall be
construed to coincide with such lot line.
(6) Any boundary shown extended into the Hudson or Croton Rivers
shall be deemed to extend to the boundary of the Village, unless
otherwise indicated.
B. In all other cases, where dimensions are not shown on the Zoning Map,
the location of boundaries shall be determined by the use of the scale
appearing on such map.

shall be considered as providing a required open space for any other
building or use on the same or any other lot.
C. No lot shall be formed from part of a lot already occupied by a building
unless such building, all yards and open spaces connected therewith,
and the remaining lot comply with all requirements prescribed by this
chapter for the district in which said lot is located. No permit shall be
issued for the erection of a building on any new lot thus created unless
such building and lot comply with all the provisions of this chapter.

construction or designated use of a building complying with existing
law, a permit for which shall have been duly issued and the construction
of which shall have been started on or before the date of passage of this
chapter and the ground-story framework of which, including the second

Gateway Overlay District
[Added 3-15-2004 by L.L. No. 3-2004]
§ 230-20.1. Purpose; definition of district.
§ 230-20.2. Location of gateway areas.
A. Croton-on-Hudsons commercial gateways are the major entry points
from surrounding municipalities and roads. The physical gateway areas
are comprised of the roads and surrounding properties a motorist or
pedestrian encounters when first entering the Village. These areas
create a sense of arrival and connection to the Village, and establish an
image and initial impression of the community.
B. The 2003 Comprehensive Plan identified three gateway areas in the
Village, which currently share the following defining characteristics:
(1) Vehicular entry points in Croton-on-Hudson from Route 9/9A.
(2) Commercial or office uses principally accessed by automobile
traffic.
(3) Possibilities for development and redevelopment.
C. The purpose of the Gateway Overlay District is to establish standards
that upgrade the image and function of gateway areas, strengthen the
overall visual identity of the Village, and improve pedestrian linkages to
adjacent residential neighborhoods.
A. Croton-on-Hudsons three gateway areas are:
(1) Harmon/South Riverside, consisting of certain lots located on
Croton Point Avenue, South Riverside Avenue and Clinton Street. A
list of the specific parcels included in the Harmon/South Riverside
area is set forth in Attachment E of this chapter, and the Zoning
Map is hereby amended to include the parcels described in the
Attachment E of this chapter. This area is an important link to the
train station via Croton Point Avenue and to the Harmon
neighborhood. It also provides a connection with the historic Van
Cortlandt Manor to the south. [Amended 6-4-2012 by L.L. No.
1-2012129]
(2) Municipal Place Shopping Area, consisting of lots on the north and
south sides of Municipal Place between Route 9 and Maple Street,
and the commercially zoned portion of the block on the east side of
129. Editor's Note: This local law also repealed L.L. No. 4-2009, adopted 11-16-2009, which was
stayed by court-ordered stipulation. Section 12 of L.L. No. 1-2012 states: The provisions
of Sections 2 through 9 of this local law shall not apply to any proposed project for which
a complete application has been submitted prior to the effective date hereof. The
provisions of the Zoning Law in effect on November 15, 2009, shall apply to such proposed
projects.

Maple Street, and the lots located between Route 9 and South
Riverside Avenue from the Village-owned parcel to the north to the
intersection of Maple and South Riverside to the south, as shown
on Figure 3.130 The Municipal Place Shopping Area is an important
entrance to the Village from Route 9. It connects to the Upper
Village via Maple Street and to the surrounding neighborhoods.

units and other permitted and/or special permit uses; provided,
however:
[1] At least 50% of the area of the first floor of any mixed-use
building must be used for nonresidential use. Residential
uses may not be located in the portion of a building's first
floor which is immediately inside the building's front
facade, it being the intention of this chapter that first-floor
front building facades, and the building areas immediately
inside first-floor front building facades, will be used for
nonresidential purposes. It is the further intention of this
law that any first-floor residential space will be located
"behind" first-floor nonresidential space as viewed from
the street/sidewalk adjacent to the building front. For the
purpose of this subsection, buildings located on street
corners shall be deemed to have building fronts on each of
the intersecting streets which form the street corner.
[2] There shall be no percentage restrictions on the amount of
residential versus nonresidential space on the second or
third floor of a mixed-use building.
[3] Residential dwelling units may be studios, one-bedroom
units and two-bedroom units only. No more than 50% of
the total number of dwelling units in a building may be
two-bedroom units.
(b) Notwithstanding any provisions of § 230-20.4 or any other
provisions of this chapter to the contrary, the following area
and bulk regulations shall apply to mixed-use buildings in the
Harmon/South Riverside Gateway area. To the extent that
contrary area/bulk regulations are not specified in this
subsection, they shall be as otherwise provided in this Code:
[1] Maximum floor area ratio (FAR) shall be 0.8.
[2] Maximum height shall be 35 feet/three stories; provided,
however, that the third story must be constructed within
the roofline of the building.
[3] The minimum front yard setback shall be 15 feet. The
maximum front yard setback shall be 20 feet. In
accordance with the general provisions of this chapter,
corner lots shall be deemed to have front yards on each of
the intersecting streets which form the corner.
[4] The Village Board shall have the authority in conducting
special permit review to reduce or waive side yard setback
requirement(s) of the underlying zone provided that there
is otherwise adequate access to parking areas, and
provided that one or more of the following criteria are met:
§ 230-20.3 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-20.3
219:545
[a] Reducing the setback(s) will facilitate more parking to
be provided in the rear of the building than would
otherwise be the case.
[b] Reducing the setback(s) will facilitate the
interconnection of rear parking lots with those on
adjoining property(ies).
[c] Reducing the setback(s) will contribute to the building
forming a more unified, cohesive streetscape with
adjoining buildings than would otherwise be the case.
[5] With the exception described below, preexisting buildings
which do not meet the front yard setback required herein
(15 feet to 20 feet) or any of the other area requirements of
this chapter (e.g. rear yard setback) shall not be permitted
to have a FAR of 0.8 nor to add third-story occupancy. They
shall be governed by the FAR and story limitations of their
underlying zone; provided, however, that preexisting
buildings which are otherwise area-compliant, but whose
front yard setback is between 10 feet and 20 feet (instead
of the required 15 feet to 20 feet) shall be permitted to
have a FAR of 0.8 and third-story occupancy.
(c) Design regulations. In addition to any other design regulations
provided in this Code, the following design guidelines shall
apply to mixed-use buildings in the Harmon/South Riverside
Gateway area:
[1] The street level facade of the front of any building shall
consist of at least sixty-percent transparent glass to
facilitate visibility into the building's first-floor commercial
premises and a retail streetscape look. For the purpose of
this subsection, buildings located on street corners shall
be deemed to have building fronts on each of the
intersecting streets which form the corner.
[2] Mixed-use buildings in the Harmon/South Riverside
Gateway area shall be subject to such additional design
guidelines as may be adopted by resolution of the Board of
Trustees from time to time.
(d) Parking.
[1] Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code to the
contrary, for mixed-use buildings in the Harmon/South
Riverside Gateway area there shall be provided at least the
following amount of parking for each residential dwelling
unit: one parking space plus one additional parking space
for each bedroom in the unit in excess of one bedroom.
(Examples: studio apartment: one space; one-bedroom
apartment: one space; two-bedroom apartment: two

spaces.) The minimum parking for nonresidential space
shall be as otherwise required by this chapter. The Village
Board of Trustees, as part of its special permit
determination, shall have the authority to increase these
parking requirements. In the case of each application,
the Village Board of Trustees shall consider and make
a finding as to whether the above-stated parking
requirements are adequate or will be increased based
upon the following factors:
[a] The mix of uses proposed to be conducted in the
various spaces in the building, considering, among
other things, the extent to which their parking
demands are likely to overlap.
[b] Whether the applicant is willing to limit areas of the
building to only certain uses.
[c] The square footage of each of the proposed residential
and commercial units in the building.
[d] The availability of nearby municipal parking.
[e] Such other factors as the Board may deem relevant on
a case-by-case basis.
[2] The Board shall have the authority to require applicant(s)
to provide and/or pay for a professional parking study.
(4) In the Municipal Place Gateway District area, on any lot in the C-2

residential zoning district and having less than three acres,
attached single-family homes, multifamily residential buildings and
mixed occupancy buildings shall be permitted by special permit of
the Village Board of Trustees, subject to the following requirements
and criteria and to the requirements/criteria contained in Article X
of this Chapter: [Added 3-2-2020 by L.L. No. 4-2020]
(a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter to the
contrary, "mixed occupancy" permitted under this section shall
mean a combination in one building of residential dwelling

[c] The square footage of each of the proposed residential
and commercial units in the building.
[d] Such other factors as the Board may deem relevant on
a case-by-case basis.
[2] The Board shall have the authority to require applicant(s)
to provide and/or pay for a professional parking and traffic
impact study.

219:550
(2) Sidewalks. All sidewalks shall be properly maintained in
accordance with Village regulations. All new property
developments must provide sidewalks along any property lines that
front on public streets, unless this requirement is waived by the
Planning Board due to the special circumstances of a particular
site. Internal sidewalks will be provided as deemed appropriate by
the Planning Board.
C. Open space. To enhance the appearance of the gateway areas and
contribute to Crotons open space character, a minimum of 15% of the
lot area shall be set aside as open space. Applicants will be required to

§ 230-20.6. Design guidelines. [Amended 6-4-2012 by L.L. No.
1-2012]
Each of the gateway areas should have a special character that should be
preserved and enhanced. Accordingly, in addition to the design regulations
set forth above in § 230-20.5 of this article, design guidelines have been
established in the 2003 Comprehensive Plan for each of the three gateway
areas that build upon the individual features of each district.
F. In order to discourage parking lots in front of buildings, except where
development of single family attached homes is proposed, new
buildings shall be oriented with the building front facing the street and
situated close to the front property line to create a more continuous
street wall. [Amended 3-2-2020 by L.L. No. 4-2020]
G. Unified parking lot design. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
chapter, in order to provide maximum efficiency, minimize curb cuts,
and encourage safe and convenient traffic flow, the Planning Board
shall have the authority in conducting site plan review to waive such
open space, design guideline and parking lot buffer, screening and
landscaping requirements as it deems advisable to encourage and
foster the joint use of, and common access to, parking lots located on
adjoining properties. The Planning Board may require as a condition of
site plan approval the interconnection of parking facilities via
circulation drives within and between adjacent lots, where necessary to
mitigate impacts on traffic or parking resulting from a proposed plan
that cannot be otherwise mitigated. In such cases, the Planning Board
will require written easement agreements between the property
owners to permit and maintain such interconnection of parking
facilities. [Amended 6-4-2012 by L.L. No. 1-2012133]
A. South Riverside/Harmon. New development, landscaping and
streetscaping in the South Riverside/Harmon District shall be designed

the goals of the Master Plan.
(a) For land located in an RA, RB or RC Zoning District, such uses
as are permitted in any residential zoning district; in a C-1
District, scaled primarily to meet the needs of the residents of
the MDU, except that such scaling down need not be required
for uses found in § 230-16A(3), (4), (5) and (6) and in an O-1
District; and
(b) For land located in a zoning district other than RA, RB or RC,
such uses as are permitted in a nonresidential zoning district.
In determining the permitted uses, consideration shall be given
to the size of the site and the location with respect to
community services, facilities and transportation. Any
permitted use other than those uses permitted for the land
immediately prior to its designation as a multiple development
use shall be deemed conditional permitted uses, revocable as
provided in this chapter.
E. Site development standards.
(1) All bulk, height and parking regulations applicable to the district in
which the land is located shall apply to an MDU except as
otherwise provided by the Board of Trustees, which is empowered
to modify the applicability of any such regulation by the resolution
designating and approving a multiple development use; provided,
however, that in no event shall:
(a) The maximum residential density exceed 110% of the density
allowed before the land was designated as an MDU.
(b) A grouping of residences exceed 200 feet in length.
§ 230-21 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-21
219:556
(c) The distance between a grouping of residences be less than the
height of the tallest building in the group.
(2) Determination of maximum density.
(a) The determination of the maximum permitted density allowed
before the land was designated as an MDU and before any
bonus shall be based on the existing zoning and the size of the
parcel without reduction for such factors as internal roads or
the requirement of dedication of property for recreational
facilities.
(b) An application for designation as an MDU shall not be
accompanied by an application for rezoning of the land into a
less restrictive district. It is the intent of this subsection that an
MDU shall not be used as a basis for increasing residential
density beyond the limits specified in this Subsection E(2).
(c) Residential density in excess of that allowed prior to
designation as an MDU shall be permitted only for
architectural excellence, inclusion of recreational facilities,
such as a swimming pool or tennis courts, or other elements
contained in the MDU which are of special benefit to the
Village, meet general community needs or reduce the potential
strain on other community facilities.
F. Procedures for MDU designation and approval of site development
plans.
(1) An MDU shall be designated by the Village Board of Trustees as an
amendment to the Zoning Map on petition of the owner of the tract
of land for which an MDU designation is sought.
(2) A petition for MDU designation shall be filed with the Village Board
of Trustees, accompanied by such fee as the Village Board of
Trustees may from time to time set in the regulations under this
section.136 Such petition shall be supported by a preliminary site
development plan containing the information required by Article Xl
of this chapter and such regulations as the Village has adopted or
may in the future adopt under such article. The submission shall
also include the following documentation:
(a) Evidence of how the particular mix of land uses meets the
needs of the residents of the proposed MDU as well as general
community needs.
(b) Evidence that the proposal is compatible with the goals of the
Master Plan.
136. Editor's Note: The current fee resolution is on file in the office of the Village Clerk.
§ 230-21 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-21
219:557
(c) If the development is to be staged, a general indication of how
the staging is to proceed. Whether or not the development is to
be staged, the preliminary site development plan shall show
the intended total project.
(3) A petition for MDU designation and all supporting submissions
shall be referred by the Village Board of Trustees to the Planning
Board, and a recommendation shall be made by the Planning Board
to the Village Board of Trustees pursuant to and within the terms
provided by Article XVI of this chapter. Subsequent to receipt of the
recommendation of the Planning Board or to the expiration of the
above-mentioned term without recommendation of the Planning
Board and after public hearing as provided by § 230-180C, the
Village Board of Trustees shall act upon the petition. If said
decision should grant the petition and amend the Village Zoning
Map, the decision shall state the permitted uses, density, bulk and
parking regulations and other regulations and conditions, all as
provided in § 230-25 of this chapter. Such conditions may include
but are not confined to visual and acoustical screening, land use
mixes, order of construction and/or occupancy, vehicular and
pedestrian circulation systems, availability of sites within the area
for necessary public services, protection of natural sites and other
such conditions that may be required by the public health, safety
and general welfare and the comfort and convenience of the public
in general and of the residents of the immediate neighborhood.
(4) After the decision of the Village Board of Trustees amending the
Village Zoning Map to designate a tract of land as an MDU, the
owner shall submit to the Planning Board preliminary and/or final
site development plans. The Planning Board shall approve, approve
conditionally or disapprove such plans, in accordance with Article
XI of this chapter and such regulations as the Village has adopted
or may in the future adopt under such article. In acting upon such
submission, the Planning Board shall be bound by the terms of the
Village Board of Trustees' amendment to the Village Zoning Map
designating as an MDU the tract of land covered by the submission.
(5) The Planning Board shall not approve any site development plan
covering less than the entirety of a tract of land designated as an
MDU.
(6) Prior to the issuance of a building permit, all site development
plans shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board.
G. Lapse of approval of site development plan. If no construction has
begun or no use has been established in the MDU within one year from
the date of the Planning Board's approval of the final site development
plan, said approval shall lapse and be of no further effect. If
construction has begun or use has been established within one year
from the date of the Planning Board's approval but the development has
not been completed within three years of said approval, then said
§ 230-21 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-21
219:558
§ 230-22. Waterfront Development (WD) District.138
approval shall, except as provided in Subsection I relating to phasing
of development, lapse and be of no further effect in relation to the
uncompleted part of the development. Upon such lapse, any
conditionally permitted use, regulation and condition made in
connection with the designation of the multiple development use shall
also lapse, and the land shall automatically be rezoned to its prior use
classification.
H. Performance guaranty. The Village Board of Trustees shall, as a
condition of the amendment of the Village Zoning Map designating an
MDU, require a bond on terms satisfactory to said Board, guaranteeing
performance of the final site development plan approved by the
Planning Board.
I. Phasing of development. The Village Board of Trustees in its
amendment to the Village Zoning Map designating an MDU or the
Planning Board in its approval of the final site development plan for an
MDU may permit or require that such development be phased over a
number of years and may direct the chronological order of
development. In such case, the term beyond which failure to complete
the development shall result in lapse of the Planning Board's approval
under Subsection G shall be, in respect of each phase of the
development, that stipulated for that phase.
J. Amendment of site development plan. Any application for amendment
of an approved site development plan shall be dealt with by the
Planning Board under Article XI of this chapter in the same manner as
an original site development plan application, except to the extent that
the required information is contained in the approved site development
plan. In acting upon an application for such amendment, the Planning
Board shall be bound by the terms of the Village Board of Trustees'
amendment to the Village Zoning Map designating as an MDU the tract
of land covered by the approved site development plan.
K. Revocation of MDU designation. The Village Board of Trustees may
revoke the designation of a tract of land as an MDU as an amendment to
the Village Zoning Map and in accordance with the procedure set forth
in Article XVI of this chapter. Upon such revocation, all uses, bulk and
parking regulations and other regulations and conditions affecting the
development of such tract of land shall be those of the original zoning
district of said tract of land.137
137. Editor's Note: Former § 3.15, Riverfront Development Use, added 8-19-1985 by L.L. No.
4-1985 to follow this section, was repealed 8-21-1989. Local Law No. 8-1989 repealed the
definitions of "shoreline" and "dry-land" from § 230-4 and also provided that the repeal
shall not affect any site plan approval or other implementing action with respect to any
property which had theretofore received a riverfront development use designation.
138. Editor's Note: L.L. No. 1-2005 repealed former Article VA, Waterfront Development
District, and renumbered former §§ 230-31.1 through 230-31.11 as § 230-22.

C. General conditions.
(1) Single development plan. The Waterfront Development District
designation shall require the tract so designated to be developed
pursuant to one site development plan covering the entirety of the
designated tract of land and showing the complete development of
the site, including any phasing which may be permitted or required
in accordance with § 230-22K(5)(d) below.
(2) Amendment to Zoning Map. A Waterfront Development District
designation shall be effected by the Village Board of Trustees as an
amendment to the Village's Zoning Map, in accordance with the
procedures set forth in Article XVI of this chapter and such
regulations as the Village has adopted, or may in the future adopt,
under such article.
(3) Site development plan approval. Proposed development of a tract
of land in a Waterfront Development District shall be subject to

Notwithstanding the above, the Planning Board may employ a
single-phase site development plan review and approval process
§ 230-22 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-22
219:560
where, in the Planning Board's judgment, said single-phase process
will be equally protective of the public health, safety and general
welfare and will serve equally to implement the purposes
enumerated in §§ 230-2 and 230-22A of this chapter. Any changes
in the uses, layout, buildings, structures or other aspects of the
development shall require a site development plan amendment and
corresponding Planning Board review and approval in conformity
with the procedures set forth in Article XI and any regulations
thereunder.
D. Permitted uses. No building or premises shall be used, and no building
or part of a building shall be erected or altered, which is arranged,

recommending approval of a special permit for any of the uses set
forth in § 230-22D(3) above, and the Village Board, before
approving an application for such a special permit, shall consider,
in addition to the requirements and objectives set forth in Article X
of this chapter, the following:
(a) Compatibility of the proposed use(s) with the use(s) of adjacent
buildings and property.
(b) Absence or prevalence of similar uses within the vicinity of the

219:562
activities that by their nature are placed or conducted out of doors
(or such other uses as are deemed by the Planning Board during
the site development plan review process to be more appropriately
conducted in nonenclosed facilities), shall be carried on in structures
fully enclosed on all sides. The outdoor storage of boats on dry land may
be permitted, provided that there is adequate screening as shown on
the approved site development plan.
H. Landscaping. The entire tract shall be suitably landscaped, as shown on
the approved site development plan. All landscaping shall be properly
maintained throughout the life of the approved uses of the
development, in accordance with the provisions of § 230-72 of this
chapter.
I. Bulk, height and parking requirements. The respective minimum and
maximum requirements and standards for all uses shall be as follows:
(1) Density.
(a) Market-rate dwelling units. The residential density shall not
exceed a maximum of one dwelling unit for every 5,000 square
feet of dry-land area.
(b) Affordable dwelling units. The Village Board of Trustees may
permit additional dwelling units not to exceed 5% of the
number calculated in accordance with the provisions of
Subsection I(1)(a) immediately above, if the additional
dwelling units are deemed by the Board of Trustees to be
affordable units. The affordable dwelling units shall be
integrated among the market-rate units in the project.
(2) Building height. The maximum building height shall be three
stories and 37 feet, except that no building within 75 feet of the
mean high-water line of the shoreline shall exceed two stories and
25 feet.
(3) Building length. The maximum horizontal dimension of any
building or structure shall not exceed 250 feet.
(4) Building spacing. The distance between any two buildings shall not
be less than 40 feet, except that unenclosed decks of reasonable
depths, as determined by the Planning Board during site
development plan review, may extend into the forty-foot-wide
separation area.
(5) Open space. At least 20% of the tract of land shall constitute "open
space," as such term is defined by this chapter.
(6) Habitable floor area. The minimum habitable floor area per
dwelling unit shall be 750 square feet, except for affordable
dwelling units, in which case the minimum habitable floor area per
dwelling unit shall be 600 square feet. (Note: The exact amount of
§ 230-22 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-22
219:563
floor area is to be determined in concert with the Village's
Affordable Housing Committee.)
(7) Building coverage. The footprints of the buildings in the project
shall not exceed 30% of the total dry-land area of the tract.
(8) Floor area ratio. The floor area ratio of the proposed use shall not

parking spaces included in the project shall be:
(a) Per dwelling unit: 2.0 spaces, plus a number of reserved guest
spaces to be determined by the Planning Board during the site
development plan review process; plus
(b) Per employee: 1.0 space; plus
(c) Per marina slip or mooring: 0.5 space; plus
(d) For all other uses: spaces in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter.
(11) Setbacks. No structure, other than for a special permit use listed in
§ 230-22D(3) above, shall be permitted within 25 feet of the mean
high-water line of the shoreline and no structure, regardless of use,
shall be permitted within 20 feet of a street line or lot line, except
as specifically permitted by the Planning Board during the site
development plan review process, based on a demonstration by the
applicant that the reduced setback will be sufficient to adequately
separate adjacent land uses.
J. Public access.
(1) Right-of-way or easement. In order to foster the purposes of this
article, in order to implement the policies expressed in the
documents listed in § 230-22A above and in order to increase public
pedestrian access to and the potential for enjoyment of the Hudson
River waterfront, the site development plan shall show a dry-land
right-of-way or easement for the enjoyment of the public, which
easement shall be not less than 20 feet in width traversing the
entire length of the site unless configured otherwise by the
Planning Board during the site development plan review process.
To the maximum extent practicable, said right-of-way or easement
shall be integrated so as to create linkages with existing and
§ 230-22 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-22
219:564
anticipated public pedestrian and bicycle trail systems on adjacent
lands.
(2) Public recreational and/or cultural facilities. Ten percent of the
total dry-land area of the site shall be developed as suitable public
recreational and/or cultural facilities, identical or similar to those
set forth in § 230-22D(1) and D(3)(h) of this chapter. In determining
adherence to this requirement, land used for public trails and
walkways [excluding residential sidewalks but including the rightof-
way or easement required by § 230-22J(1) immediately above],
bike paths and boat-launching facilities shall be included. In
meeting this requirement, a minimum of 0.5 acre shall be in the
form of public recreational and/or cultural facilities identical or
similar to those set forth in § 230-22D(1) and D(3)(h), excluding
associated parking spaces.
(3) Meanings of "public." For the purposes of § 230-22J(1) and J(2)
immediately above, the usage of and access to the respective public
facilities shall be as determined by the Village Board of Trustees,
on a case-by-case basis, during the designation of a tract of land as
a Waterfront Development District; said facilities may be open to
the general public or restricted to Village residents as deemed
appropriate by the Village Board. In any event, usage of and access
to such facilities shall either be at no cost or will require no more
than a nominal fee. If deemed appropriate by the Planning Board
during the site development plan review process, the common and
private recreational facilities specified in § 230-22J(4) below may
be allowed to fulfill part of the 10% set aside for public recreational
and/or cultural facilities required in § 230-22J(2) above.
(4) Other common and private recreational facilities. Residential
developments may also have other permitted recreational facilities
which are common and private to the development and which may
also be available to adjoining development.
K. Procedures for district designation and site development plan approval.
(1) Designation. A Waterfront Development District shall be
designated by the Village Board of Trustees as an amendment to
the Zoning Map on the initiative of the Board of Trustees or on
petition of the owner of the tract of land for which a Waterfront
Development District designation is sought.
(2) Petition procedure. If the Waterfront Development District
designation is based upon a petition from the owner of the tract of
land, a petition for the Waterfront Development District
designation shall be filed with the Village Board of Trustees,
accompanied by such fee as the Village Board of Trustees may from
time to time set in the regulations associated with this article. Such
petition shall be supported by a site development plan containing
the information required by Article XI of this chapter and such
§ 230-22 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-22
219:565
regulations as the Village has adopted, or may adopt in the future,
under such article. The submission shall also include the following
documentation:
(a) Evidence of how the proposed use(s) would meet the needs of
the residents of the project as well as general community
needs.
(b) Evidence that the proposal is generally compatible with the
goals of the Village's Master Plan, its Local Waterfront (c)
Revitalization Program, its Greenway Vision Plan and the
purposes of this article.
(c) If the development is to be phased, a general indication of how
the phasing is to proceed. Whether or not the development is
to be phased, the site development plan shall show the total
project.
(3) Referral to Planning Board and designation decision. The proposed
designation of a Waterfront Development District by the Village
Board of Trustees or the petition for a Waterfront Development
District designation by the owner of the tract of land and all
supporting submissions shall be referred by the Village Board of
Trustees to the Planning Board. A recommendation shall be made
by the Planning Board to the Board of Trustees pursuant to and
within the term provided by Article XVI of this chapter. Subsequent
to the receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Board, or
subsequent to the expiration of the above-mentioned term without
the recommendation of the Planning Board, and after public
hearing as provided by Article XVI of this chapter and the
conclusion of the state environmental quality review process, the
Village Board of Trustees shall act upon the petition.
(4) Designation conditions. A Waterfront Development District
designation may be contingent upon terms and conditions
pertaining to, but not limited to, mix of land uses, visual and
acoustical screening, the sequence of construction and/or
occupancy, systems for vehicular and pedestrian circulation,
availability of sites for necessary public services, protection of
natural resources and other such conditions that may be required
for the public health, safety and general welfare and for the
comfort and convenience of the public in general and the residents
and landowners of the project and the immediate neighborhood in
particular.
(5) Site development plan. Prior to development in a Waterfront
Development District, the owner of the tract of land or his designee
shall submit to the Planning Board a site development plan. The
Planning Board shall be bound by the terms and conditions of the
Village Board of Trustees' amendment to the Village Zoning Map
designating the tract of land as a Waterfront Development District.
§ 230-22 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-22
219:566
(a) Access. The site development plan submission shall include a
detailed plan for the applicant's construction (and
maintenance, if dedication to the Village would not ensue) of
vehicular and pedestrian access to the site, if such access is
not already provided adequately by Village-maintained streets
and roads.
(b) Site development plan approval.
[1] Site development plan approval shall be conditioned upon
the development being designed to adequately preserve an
open character with respect to principal views of the
Hudson River from residential areas of the Village as well
as principal views from the Hudson River to residential
areas of the Village, through the appropriate placement,
spacing, height and bulk of buildings and structures.
[2] The Planning Board shall not approve any site
development plan covering less than the entirety of the
tract of land designated as a Waterfront Development
District.
(c) Lapse of approval of site development plan. If no construction
has begun or if no use has been established in the project
within one year from the date of the adoption of the Planning
Board's resolution of site development plan approval (final site
development plan approval in the case of a two-phase process),
said approval shall lapse and be of no further effect. If
construction has begun or if the use has been established
within said one-year period, but if the development has not
been completed within three years of said approval, then said
approval shall, except as provided in § 230-22K(5)(d) of this
chapter relating to the phasing of development, lapse and be of
no further effect in relation to the uncompleted part of the
development. The Planning Board may, in its discretion, extend
said three-year completion period, upon application prior to its
expiration, if such extension is warranted by the particular
circumstances of the development.
(d) Phasing of development. The Village Board of Trustees in its
amendment to the Village Zoning Map designating a
Waterfront Development District based upon a petition by a
landowner, or the Planning Board in its approval of the site
development plan, may permit or require that such
development be phased over a number of years and may direct
the chronological order of development. In such case, the term
beyond which failure to complete the development shall result
in a lapse of the Planning Board's approval under
§ 230-22K(5)(c) above shall be stipulated by the Board of
Trustees or Planning Board for each phase of development.
The public recreational and/or cultural facilities required by
§ 230-22 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-22
219:567
§ 230-23. through § 230-31. (Reserved)
§ 230-22J(2) of this chapter and any other recreational and/or
cultural facilities shall not constitute the final phases of the
project.
(e) Guarantee of performance. The Planning Board shall, as a
condition of site development plan approval, require a
performance guarantee with terms satisfactory to said Board,
for the purpose of guaranteeing performance by the applicant
with respect to improvements and infrastructure to be offered
in dedication to the Village, erosion and sedimentation control
measures and potential site restoration measures regarding
the approved site development plan.
(f) Amendment of the site development plan. Any application for
amendment of an approved site development plan shall be
processed by the Planning Board in the same manner as an
original site development plan application, except to the extent
that the required information is contained on the approved site
development plan. In acting upon an application for such
amendment, the Planning Board shall be bound by the terms
and conditions of the Village Board of Trustees' amendment to
the Village Zoning Map designating the tract as a Waterfront
Development District.
(6) Amendment of Waterfront Development District designation. The
Village Board of Trustees may amend the designation of a tract of
land as a Waterfront Development District as an amendment to the
Village Zoning Map, in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Article XVI of this chapter. Upon such amendment, all uses, bulk
and parking regulations, and other provisions and conditions
affecting the development of such tract of land, shall be those of the
new zoning district designation of said tract.

B. Calculating floor area ratio (FAR) for oversized and undersized onefamily
residences. The permitted floor area for one-family homes on lots
that are larger or smaller than the minimum zoning lot size is obtained
by multiplying the FAR for the zoning district in which the home is
located by the lot size. For example, for a 50,000 square foot lot in an
RA-40 District, multiply 50,000 by 0.15.

districts. [Amended 5-7-1990 by L.L. No. 2-1990; 9-12-1994 by L.L.
No. 7-1994; 1-31-2005 by L.L. No. 1-2005]
A. Accessory buildings.
(1) An accessory building may be located in any required side or rear
yard, provided that:
(a) Such building shall not exceed 15 feet in height.
(b) Except as provided in Subsection H below for fences, walls,
and retaining walls, such buildings shall be set back not less
than five feet from any lot line. [Amended 3-6-2017 by L.L.
No. 1-2017]
(c) All such buildings in the aggregate shall not occupy more than
30% of the area of the required rear and side yards.
(2) Accessory buildings on adjoining lots constructed at the same time
may be located in pairs or groups in the required rear or side yard
along the common side lot line or rear lot line of contiguous lots.
B. Relation of accessory buildings to streets. Except as provided in
Subsection H below for fences, walls, and retaining walls, no accessory
building shall project nearer to the streets on which the principal
building fronts than such principal building. Should topographic
conditions be such that practical difficulties would be caused by this
requirement with respect to the location of garages or if the principal
building does not face upon the street or for that or other reason
related to topography or the characteristics of the neighborhood the
requirement that accessory buildings project nearer to the street than
such principal building is not appropriate, the Zoning Board of Appeals
may authorize the issuance of a special permit for the erection of such
garage or other accessory building which may project nearer to the
street than such principal building, the normal front yard setback
requirements for a principal building to apply to such garage or
accessory building unless the Zoning Board of Appeals shall specify
otherwise and except that the Zoning Board of Appeals may authorize
the issuance of a special permit for the erection of garages within not
less than 10 feet of the street line where the natural slope of the ground
within 25 feet of such line is between 12% and 20% and within not less
than five feet of the street line where such slope within 25 feet of such
line exceeds 20%. [Amended 3-6-2017 by L.L. No. 1-2017]
C. Corner lots.
(1) Obstruction to vision at street intersections. At all street
intersections in all residence districts, no obstructions to vision
§ 230-40 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-40
219:577
exceeding 30 inches in height above curb level shall be erected or
maintained on any lot within the triangle formed by the street lines
of such lot and a line drawn between points along such street lines
30 feet distant from their point of intersection, except tree trunks
cleared to a height of eight feet.
(2) Rear and side yards. On a corner lot, front yards are required on
both street frontages, and one yard other than the front yards shall
be deemed to be a rear yard and the other or others, side yards.
The minimum district requirements for each shall be complied
with.
D. Exceptions to lot depth requirements. The minimum lot depth at any
point may be decreased to 75% of the minimum requirement if the
average depth conforms to the minimum requirement.
E. Exceptions to yard requirements.
(1) Permitted obstructions. Cornices or cantilevered roofs may project
not more than two feet into a required yard. Belt courses,
windowsills and other ornamental features may project not more
than six inches into a required yard. Paved terraces, steps and
walks, other than such as are needed for access to the buildings on
the lot, shall not project within 15 feet of a street line or four feet of
a property line. [Amended 3-6-2017 by L.L. No. 1-2017]
(2) Entries and porticos. A roofed-over but unenclosed projection in
the nature of an entry or portico not more than eight feet wide and
extending not more than six feet out from the front wall of the
building shall be exempt from the requirements of this subsection
when the building otherwise complies with the regulations of this
subsection. In computing the average setback, the presence of such
entries and porticos shall be ignored.
(3) Existing setback. No proposed one-family or two-family dwelling
need have a front yard greater than the average setback of two or
more existing dwellings located within 300 feet on each side of said
proposed dwelling, on the same side of the street and within the
same block and the same district.
F. Exceptions to height requirements for office buildings and laboratories.
District height limitations shall not apply to chimneys, antennas,
ventilators, skylights, water tanks, bulkheads, cooling towers,
necessary mechanical appurtenances and similar features usually
carried above the roof level in office or laboratory buildings, provided
that:
(1) The aggregate area covered by all such features shall not exceed
20% of the area of the roof of the building on which they are
located.
§ 230-40 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-40
219:578
(2) The height of each such feature shall not exceed 15 feet above the
district height limitations.
(3) All such features, except antennas, shall be suitably screened in a
manner which is in harmony with the building of which they are a
part.
G. Existing small lots in all RA and RB Districts.
(1) Less than required area or width. A lot owned individually and
separately on January 22, 1962, and owned individually and
separately at all times thereafter, which has a total area or width
less than prescribed herein, may be used for a one-family residence
in RA and RB Districts and a two-family residence in RB Districts,
provided that such a lot shall be developed in conformity with all
applicable district regulations other than the minimum lot area and
lot width requirements, and with the minimum side yards set forth
below: [Amended 11-3-2014 by L.L. No. 2-2014]

(2) Less than required depth. A lot owned individually and separately
on January 22, 1962, and owned individually and separately at all
times thereafter, which has a depth less than that prescribed
herein, may be used for a one-family residence in RA and RB
Districts and a two-family residence in RB Districts, provided that
such lot shall be developed in conformity with all applicable district
regulations other than the minimum lot depth requirement and
provided that the rear yard is at least 25% of the lot depth.
H. Fences and walls. [Added 3-6-2017 by L.L. No. 1-2017]

(1) Fences or walls in front yards shall be not more than four feet in
height and, in the case of fences, not more than 50% solid, except
as provided in Subsection C(1) above; provided, however, that the
Planning Board shall have the authority, during the site plan review
process, to approve retaining walls in front yards with a maximum
height of six feet if the Planning Board makes a determination that
a higher wall is required for the grading necessary to construct the
driveway or primary structure.
(2) Fences or walls not over six feet in height may be erected anywhere
on a lot except in a front yard.
(3) Fences not over eight feet in height and not more than 25% solid
may be erected anywhere on a lot except in a front yard.
(4) Fences shall be erected with the finished side facing the street(s) or
abutting lot(s).
A. An accessory apartment shall be permitted in a single-family detached
dwelling, on a lot containing no more than one dwelling unit, in districts
permitting single-family residences upon approval by the Planning
Board, subject to the conditions and limitations contained in this
section.
B. No accessory apartment shall be installed or maintained except upon
approval by the Planning Board. The application procedures and
required submittals shall be the same as for minor site plan approval,
except that noticing shall be required for property owners within 100
feet of the subject property and that scaled floor plans for the dwelling,
with floor areas noted, shall be submitted as part of the application. The
application fee for an accessory apartment application shall be an
amount set by resolution of the Board of Trustees. Approval for an
accessory apartment shall be issued to and run with the property
owner.
C. The owner of a detached dwelling in which the accessory apartment is
located shall occupy at least one of the dwelling units on the premises
as his primary residence. For the purposes of this § 230-41C of the
Zoning Code, the word "owner" shall mean: any individual who is an
owner of the subject premises, including a joint tenant, tenant in
common or tenant by the entireties; or the grantor and/or beneficiary of
a trust that owns the subject premises; or the owner of a majority of the
membership interest/share interest in an LLC or corporation that owns
the premises.
§ 230-40 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-41
219:580
(1) The Planning Board approval for an accessory apartment shall
become null and void within 90 days of any of the following events:
change of property ownership; b) death of the property owner; or
change in residence of the owner. The Planning Board may grant a
ninety-day extension past the expiration for good cause, including
that an application has been filed to continue an accessory
apartment use.
(2) Upon a change in ownership, should the new owner desire to
continue the accessory apartment use, then the owner shall apply
to the Planning Board for renewal of the approval.
D. Only one accessory apartment per single-family detached dwelling shall
be permitted.
E. No accessory apartment shall be permitted on premises where there is
also a professional office use.
F. An accessory apartment shall be permitted only within the main
structure and not within any accessory building. The character, degree
and extent of any additions to the residence shall be a factor to be
considered by the Planning Board in approval of an application for an
accessory apartment.
G. An accessory apartment shall have separate access, not observable
from the street, unless there is a single access from the front of the
building with a split access inside the building.
H. All code requirements under Village law and other applicable laws and
regulations shall be complied with and a building permit obtained for
any changes or alterations requiring such permit.
I. The habitable floor area of an accessory apartment shall be no less than
400 square feet and no greater than the lesser of 750 square feet or
33.3% of the habitable floor area of the dwelling in which it is
contained.
J. The lot size for buildings containing accessory apartments shall
conform to the requirements of the district in which the building is
located, unless a variance shall have been granted by the Zoning Board
of Appeals.
K. The building shall, to the degree reasonably feasible, maintain the
character and appearance of a single-family dwelling.
L. A residence containing an accessory apartment shall have a minimum
of three off-street parking spaces. In an RA-5 District, no expansion of
the existing parking area shall be permitted in order to satisfy this offstreet
parking requirement.
M. If the premises are not serviced by the Village sewer system, approval
of the Westchester County Department of Health shall be obtained
before Planning Board approval.
§ 230-41 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-42
219:581
§ 230-42. Supplementary regulations for the Multiple Residence RC
District. [Amended 1-31-2005 by L.L. No. 1-2005]
A. Exceptions to yard requirements. Garages designed so as to allow the
use of the roof thereof as part of the grounds may be erected in side or
rear yards, not nearer than four feet to any property line, provided that
the average height of such wall or walls thereof which face a side lot
line or a rear lot line is not in excess of 6 1/2 feet above the average
level of such lot line. The side yard provision may be eliminated, but not
reduced, along any portion of a lot line where a building erected on an
adjoining lot is built to the lot line, provided that the second side yard
shall be increased to a minimum width of two times the width otherwise
required.
B. Exceptions to maximum coverage regulations. Where the Board of
Trustees finds that the provisions of the required off-street parking
space underneath the principal building or in such a way as to enable

combination of amplitudes and frequencies beyond the "safe" range
of Table 7, United States Bureau of Mines Bulletin No. 442, Seismic
Effects of Quarry Blasting, on any nearby structure. The methods
and equations of said Bulletin No. 442 shall be used to compute all
values for the enforcement of this subsection.
(3) Odors. No emission shall be permitted of odorous gases or other
odorous matter in such quantities as to be offensive at the specified
points of measurement. Any process which may involve the
creation or emission of any odor shall be provided with a secondary
safeguard system so that control will be maintained if the primary
safeguard system should fail. There is hereby established, as a
guide in determining such quantities of offensive odors, Table III
(Odor Thresholds) in Chapter 5, Air Pollution Abatement Manual,

housing units.143 [Added 11-5-2018 by L.L. No. 9-2018]
extension for a period of not more than six months. All new uses,
buildings or other structures shall comply with the applicable
performance standards when put into operation.
A. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
AFFORDABLE AFFIRMATIVELY FURTHERING FAIR HOUSING
(AFFH) UNIT 
A for-purchase housing unit that is affordable to a household whose
income does not exceed 80% of the area median income (AMI) for
Westchester as defined annually by the United States Department
of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and for which the
annual housing cost of a unit, including common charges, principal,
interest, taxes and insurance (PITI), does not exceed 33% of 80%
AMI, adjusted for family size and that is marketed in accordance
with the Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing
Affirmative Marketing Plan; and
(1)
A rental unit that is affordable to a household whose income does
not exceed 60% AMI and for which the annual housing cost of the
unit, defined as rent plus any tenant-paid utilities, does not exceed
30% of 60% AMI adjusted for family size and that is marketed
in accordance with the Westchester County Fair and Affordable
Housing Affirmative Marketing Plan.
(2)
B. Required affordable AFFH unit component.
(1) Within all residential developments of 10 or more units created by
subdivision or site plan approval, no less than 10% of the total
number of units must be created as AFFH units. Rounding shall be
done as follows: for 10 to 14 housing units: one AFFH unit; for 15 to
24 housing units: two AFFH; then continuing in like increments as
the number of housing units increase.
(2) Notwithstanding the above, all such AFFH units, whether for
purchase or for rent, shall be marketed in accordance with the
Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing Affirmative
Marketing Plan in place at the time.
C. Waivers for creation of additional fair and affordable housing. If a site
plan or subdivision applicant wishes to voluntarily provide more AFFH
units than are required by Subsection B above, the Village Board shall
have the authority, but not the obligation, to waive such zoning and
other land use regulations as it deems appropriate to allow additional
143. Editor's Note: Former § 230-48, Dish antennas, added 12-16-1985 by L.L. No. 11-1985, as
amended, was repealed 1-31-2005 by L.L. No. 1-2005; see now § 230-74, Plan amendments
for dish antennas.
§ 230-47 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-48
219:598
dwelling unit(s) to be constructed, beyond the number which would
otherwise be permitted under the Village's Zoning Code and other land
use regulations if all of their requirements were adhered to. In order to
qualify to be considered for this waiver, an applicant must demonstrate
that, without the waiver, the inclusion of the additional AFFH unit(s)
would impose a financial burden that would prevent the applicant from
realizing a reasonable economic return on its development.
D. Maximum rent and sales price. The maximum monthly rent for an AFFH
unit and the maximum gross sales price for an AFFH unit shall be
established in accordance with United States Department of Housing
and Urban Development guidelines as published in the current edition
of the "Westchester County Area Median Income (AMI) Sales and Rent
Limits" available from the County of Westchester.
E. Time period of affordability. Units designated as AFFH units must
remain affordable for a minimum of 50 years from date of initial
certificate of occupancy for rental properties and from date of original
sale for ownership units.
F. Property restriction. A property containing any AFFH units must be
restricted using a mechanism such as a declaration of restrictive
covenants in recordable form acceptable to Municipal Counsel which
shall ensure that the AFFH unit shall remain subject to regulations for
the minimum fifty-year period of affordability. Among other provisions,
the covenants shall require that the unit be the primary residence of the
resident household selected to occupy the unit. Upon approval, such
declaration shall be recorded against the property containing the AFFH
unit prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the
development.
G. Unit appearance and integration.
(1) Within single-family developments, the AFFH units may be singlefamily
homes or, if the Planning Board so elects, they may be
incorporated into one or more two-family homes. If the Planning
Board so elects, one or more AFFH unit(s) may be located on a lot
meeting 75% of the minimum lot area for the single-family homes in
the development. Each such two-family home shall be located on a
lot meeting the minimum lot area for the single-family homes in the
development. All such units shall be indistinguishable in
appearance, siting and exterior design from the other single-family
homes in the development, to the furthest extent possible. Interior
finishes and furnishings may be reduced in quality and cost to
assist in the lowering of the cost of development of the AFFH units.
(2) Within multifamily developments, the AFFH units shall be
physically integrated into the design of the development and,
where multiple AFFH units are required, to the extent feasible,
they shall be distributed among various sizes (efficiency, one-, two-,
three- and four-bedroom units) in the same proportion as all other
§ 230-48 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-48
219:599
units in the development. The AFFH units shall not be
distinguishable from other market rate units from the outside or
building exteriors. Interior finishes and furnishings may be reduced
in quality and cost to assist in the lowering of the cost of
development of the AFFH units.
H. Minimum floor area.
(1) The minimum gross floor area per AFFH unit shall not be less than
80% of the average floor area of nonrestricted housing units in the
development and no less than the following:
Dwelling Unit
Minimum Gross Floor Area
(square feet)
Efficiency 450
1-bedroom 675
2-bedroom 750
3-bedroom 1,000 (including at least 1.5 baths)
4-bedroom 1,200 (including at least 1.5 baths)
(2) For the purposes of this section, paved terraces or balconies may
be counted toward the minimum gross floor area requirement in an
amount not to exceed 1/3 of the square footage of such terraces or
balconies.
(3) As an alternative or supplemental standard if the Planning Board so
elects: The minimum gross floor area per AFFH unit shall be in
accordance with the standards set forth by the New York State
Division of Housing and Community Renewal and the New York
State Housing Trust Fund Corporation in Section 4.03.03 of the
most recent edition of its joint Design Manual. See:
http://nysdhcr.gov/Publications/DesignHandbook/
UF2009_DesignHandbook.pdf or its successor.
I. Occupancy standards. For the sale or rental of AFFH units, the
following occupancy schedule shall apply:
Number of Bedrooms Number of Persons
Efficiency Minimum: 1; maximum: 1
1-bedroom Minimum: 1; maximum: 3
2-bedroom Minimum: 2; maximum: 5
3-bedroom Minimum: 3; maximum: 7
4-bedroom Minimum: 4; maximum: 9
J. Affirmative marketing. The AFFH units created under the provisions of
this section shall be sold or rented and resold and re-rented during the
required period of affordability, only to qualifying income-eligible
§ 230-48 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-48
219:600
households. Such income-eligible households shall be solicited in
accordance with the requirements, policies and protocols established
in the Westchester County Fair and Affordable Housing Affirmative
Marketing Plan then in effect.
K. Resale requirements.
(1) In the case of owner-occupied AFFH units, the title to said property
shall be restricted so that in the event of any resale by the home
buyer or any successor, the resale price shall not exceed the thenmaximum
sales price for said unit, as determined in this section, or
the sum of (i) the net purchase price (i.e., gross sales prices minus
subsidies) paid for the unit by the selling owner, increased by the
percentage increase, if any, in the Consumer Price Index for Urban
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers in the New York-Northern New
Jersey Area, as published by the United States Bureau of Labor
Statistics (the "Index") on any date between (a) the month that was
two months earlier than the date on which the seller acquired the
unit and (b) the month that is two months earlier than the month in
which the seller contracts to sell the unit. If the Bureau stops
publishing this index, and fails to designate a successor index, the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson will designate a substitute index; and
(ii) the cost of major capital improvements made by the seller of the
unit while said seller of the unit owned the unit as evidenced by
paid receipts depreciated on a straight line basis over a fifteen-year
period from the date of completion and such approval shall be
requested for said major capital improvements no later than the
time the seller of the unit desires to include it in the resale price.
(2) Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the resale price
exceed an amount affordable to a household at 80% of AMI at the
time of the resale.
L. Lease renewal requirements.
(1) Applicants for rental AFFH units shall, if eligible and if selected for
occupancy, sign leases for a term of no more than two years. As
long as a resident remains eligible and has complied with the terms
of the lease, said resident shall be offered renewal leases for a term
of no more than two years each. Renewal of a lease shall be subject
to the conditions of federal, state or county provisions that may be
imposed by the terms of the original development funding
agreements for the development or to the provisions of other
applicable local law.
(2) If no such provisions are applicable and if a resident's annual gross
income should subsequently exceed the maximum then allowable,
as defined in this chapter, then said resident may complete their
current lease term and shall be offered a nonrestricted rental unit
available in the development at the termination of such lease term,
if available. If no such dwelling unit shall be available at said time,
§ 230-48 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-48
219:601
§ 230-48.1. Solar energy systems. [Added 8-12-2019 by L.L. No.
8-2019]
the resident may be allowed to sign one additional one-year lease
for the AFFH unit they occupy but shall not be offered a renewal of
the lease beyond the expiration of said term.
M. Administrative and monitoring agency. The County of Westchester shall
be responsible for monitoring the AFFH units during the units' periods
of affordability and for monitoring compliance with the affirmative
marketing responsibilities of those creating the AFFH units.
N. Expedited project review process.
(1) Preapplication meeting. The Planning Board's preapplication
meeting process shall be followed in connection with developments
which include AFFH units. The purposes of the preapplication
meeting will include discussion of means to expedite the
development application review process through:
(a) The early identification of issues, concerns, code compliance
and coordination matters that may arise during the review and
approval process.
(b) The establishment of a comprehensive review process outline,
proposed meeting schedule, and conceptual timeline.
(2) Meeting schedule and timeline. Village departments, boards,
commissions, committees and staff shall endeavor to honor the
proposed meeting schedule and conceptual timeline established as
an outcome of the preapplication process to the greatest extent
possible during the review and approval process, subject to the
demonstrated cooperation of the applicant to adhere to same.
Should the approval process extend beyond one year, an applicant
for a development including AFFH units shall be entitled to at least
one additional meeting per year with the same departments,
boards, commissions, or committees to review any and all items
discussed at previous preapplication meetings.
(3) Calendar/agenda priority. Municipal departments, boards,
commissions, or committees with review or approval authority over
applications for developments which include AFFH units shall give
priority to such applications by placing applications for
developments including AFFH units high enough on all meeting
and work session calendars and agendas so they will not be
bumped to a subsequent meeting, because of lack of time and,
when feasible based on the ability to conduct required reviews and
public notice, with the intent of shortening minimum advance
submission deadlines to the extent practicable.
A. Authority. These provisions for solar energy systems are adopted
pursuant to §§ 7-700 through 7-704 of the Village Law and § 20 of the

prior to December 14, 1961.
B. Areas computed as parking spaces. Areas which may be computed as
open or enclosed off-street parking spaces include any private garage,
carport or other area available for parking, other than a street or a
driveway. However, a driveway within a required front yard for a onefamily
or two-family residence may count as one parking space, other
than a driveway located on a portion of a corner lot upon which an
obstruction may not be placed or maintained under § 230-40C(1).
C. Location and ownership of required accessory parking facilities.
Required accessory parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be provided
upon the same lot as the use to which they are accessory or elsewhere,
provided that all spaces therein are located within 500 feet walking
distance of such lot. In all cases, such parking spaces shall conform to
all the regulations of the district in which they are located, and in no
event shall such parking spaces be located in any residence district
unless the uses to which they are accessory are permitted in such
districts or by special permit of the Board of Appeals. Unless otherwise
approved by the Planning Board, such spaces shall be in the same
ownership as the use to which they are accessory and shall be subject
to deed restriction, filed with the County Clerk, binding the owner and
his heirs and assigns to maintain the required number of spaces
available either: [Amended 6-4-2012 by L.L. No. 1-2012144]
§ 230-51 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-51
219:612
§ 230-52. Supplementary regulations for parking and loading
facilities.
(1) Throughout the existence of such use to which they are accessory;
or
(2) Until such spaces are provided elsewhere.
D. Size of spaces. Three hundred square feet shall be considered one
parking space (to provide room for standing area and aisles for
maneuvering). Entrance and exit roadways shall not be computed as
parking space except for one-family and two-family residences as in
Subsection B above.
E. Access. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided.
Such access shall consist of at least one ten-foot lane for parking areas
with less than 20 spaces and at least two ten-foot lanes for parking
areas with 20 spaces or more.
F. Drainage and surfacing. All open parking areas shall be properly
drained, and all such areas of over 10 spaces shall be provided with a
dustless surface, except for parking spaces accessory to a one-family or
two-family residence.
G. Joint facilities. Required parking spaces, open or enclosed, may be
provided in spaces designed to serve jointly two or more
establishments, whether or not located on the same lot, provided that
the number of required spaces in such joint facilities shall be not less
than the total required for all such establishments.
H. Combined spaces. When any lot contains two or more uses having
different parking requirements, the parking requirements for each use
shall apply to the extent of that use. Where it can be conclusively
demonstrated that one or more such uses will be generating a demand
for parking spaces primarily during periods when the other use or uses
is not or are not in operation, the Board of Appeals may reduce the total
parking spaces required for that use with the least requirement.
A. Access near street corners. No entrance or exit for any accessory offstreet
parking area with over 10 parking spaces nor any loading berth
shall be located within 50 feet of the intersection of any two street lines.
B. On lots divided by district boundaries. When a lot is located partly in
one district and partly in another district, the regulations for the district
requiring the greater number of parking spaces or loading berths shall
apply to all of the lot. Parking spaces or loading berths on such a lot
144. Editor's Note: This local law also repealed L.L. No. 4-2009, adopted 11-16-2009, which was
stayed by court-ordered stipulation. Section 12 of L.L. No. 1-2012 states: The provisions
of Sections 2 through 9 of this local law shall not apply to any proposed project for which
a complete application has been submitted prior to the effective date hereof. The
provisions of the Zoning Law in effect on November 15, 2009, shall apply to such proposed
projects.
§ 230-51 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-52

may be located without regard to district lines, provided that no such
parking spaces or loading berths shall be located in any residence
district, unless the use to which they are accessory is permitted in such
district or by special permit of the Board of Appeals.
C. Supplementary parking regulations in the Multiple Residence RC
District. In the RC District, wherever space is provided for the parking
of 10 or more vehicles in the open, such spaces shall be individually
identified by means of pavement markings and shall be screened by a
substantial solid wall or fence or thick hedge 6 1/2 feet in height above
the average finished grade of the parking area. No parking space shall
be located in any front yard or within 10 feet of any lot line in side or
rear years. The parking of motor vehicles within 15 feet of any wall or
portion thereof of a two- or more family dwelling, which wall contains
legal windows, other than legal bathroom or kitchen windows, with a
sill height of less than eight feet above the level of said parking space is
prohibited. No service of any kind shall be permitted to be extended to
users of the lot, including automobile service, repair or refueling, and
no gasoline, oil, grease or other supplies shall be stored or sold in any
such lot or in any garage on such lot.
D. Supplementary regulations for any parking spaces adjacent to
residence districts.
(1) Wherever a parking lot abuts the side or rear lot line of a lot in a
residence district, said parking lot shall be screened from such
adjoining lot by a substantial wall or fence or thick hedge with a
height of not less than 6 1/2 feet.
(2) Wherever a parking lot is located across the street from other land
in any residence district, it shall be screened from the view of such
land by a thick hedge located along a line drawn parallel to the
street and a distance of 20 feet therefrom, such hedge to be
interrupted only at points of ingress and egress. The open area
between such hedge and the street shall be landscaped in harmony
with the landscaping prevailing on neighboring properties fronting
on the same street.
(3) Identification and directional signs shall not exceed an area of
three square feet each and shall be limited to such as are essential
for the particular use.
E. Landscape standards. [Added 6-18-2001 by L.L. No. 10-2001]
(1) Parking lots.
(a) Off-street parking and loading areas shall be curbed and
landscaped with appropriate trees, shrubs and other plant
materials and ground cover, as approved by the Planning
Board; such approval shall be based upon consideration of the
adequacy of the proposed landscaping, to assure the
establishment of a safe, convenient and attractive parking
§ 230-52 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-52
219:614
facility needing a minimum amount of maintenance, including
plant care, snowplowing and the removal of leaves and other
debris. These standards shall apply to all proposed parking
areas in proposed site plans, except for the following:
[1] Parking spaces accessory to a single- or two- family
dwelling.
[2] Parking spaces serving a commercial building of less than
5,000 square feet.
(b) At least one tree not less than 2 1/2 inches caliper, measured
three feet above ground level at time of planting, shall be
provided within such parking areas for every 10 parking
spaces. In all off-street parking areas containing 25 or more
parking spaces, at least 10% of the interior of the parking area
shall be curbed and landscaped with trees, shrubs and other
material.
(c) Raised planting islands at least six feet in width shall be
provided to guide vehicle movement and to separate opposing
rows of parking spaces so as to provide adequate space for
plant growth, pedestrian circulation and vehicle overhang.
Such raised planting islands and the landscaping within them
shall be designed and arranged in such a way as to provide
vertical definition to major traffic circulation aisles, entrances
and exits, to channel internal traffic flow and prevent
indiscriminate diagonal movement of vehicles and to provide
relief from the visual monotony and shadeless expanse of a
large parking area. Curbs of such islands shall be designed so
as to facilitate surface drainage and prevent vehicles from
overlapping sidewalks and damaging landscaping materials.
The Planning Board may accept an alternative to the interior
landscape requirements if it finds that an applicant has
submitted a superior landscape plan.
(d) All maintenance equipment, including accessories, shall be
stored in enclosed structures only, which shall conform to the
architectural theme of the development.
(2) Screening and buffer areas.
(a) Landscaped areas. All portions of multifamily and
nonresidential properties which are not used for buildings,
structures, off-street parking and loading areas, sidewalks or
similar purposes shall be suitably landscaped and permanently
maintained with the planting of trees and shrubbery, as
approved by the Planning Board as part of the site plan, so as
to minimize erosion and stormwater runoff and harmoniously
blend such uses with the residential character of the Village as
a whole.
§ 230-52 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-52
219:615
(b) Buffer areas.
[1] On all multifamily and nonresidential developed
properties, a landscaped buffer area shall be required to
screen and protect neighboring properties from the view
of uses and parking areas on the site.
[a] This buffer shall be at least 10 feet in depth along any
lot line and along any street.
[b] It shall be of evergreen planting of such type, density
and height, which in the judgment of the Planning
Board, will effectively screen the activities on the lot
from view of persons standing on adjoining properties.
The plan and specifications for such planting shall be
filed with the approval plan for the use of the lot.
[2] A wall or fence, of location, height and design approved by
the Planning Board, may be substituted for the required
planting.
[a] Modifications. Where the existing topography and/or
landscaping provides adequate screening, the
Planning Board may modify the planting and/or buffer
area requirements.
[b] Maintenance and responsibility. All planting shown on
an approved site plan or special permit plan, including
planting within a street right-of-way, shall be
maintained by the property owner in a vigorous
condition throughout the duration of the use, and
plants not so maintained shall be replaced with new
plants at the beginning of the next immediately
following growing season.
[3] All new plant materials shall be consistent with the
existing vegetation of the site and the surrounding areas.
Plant materials judged to be inappropriate by the Planning
Board will not be approved.

ARTICLE IX
Nonconforming Buildings and Uses
§ 230-53. Regulation and control.
Subject to the provisions of § 230-54, the following provisions shall apply to
all buildings and uses existing on the effective date of this chapter, which
buildings and uses do not conform to the requirements set forth in this
chapter, to all buildings and uses that become nonconforming by reason of
any subsequent amendment to this chapter and the Zoning Map which is a
part thereof and to all conforming buildings housing nonconforming uses:
A. Any nonconforming use, except those nonconforming uses specified in
Subsection E may be continued indefinitely, but:
(1) Shall not be enlarged, extended, reconstructed or placed on a
different portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such uses
on the effective date of this chapter, nor shall any external evidence
of such use be increased by any means whatsoever. [Amended
1-19-1999 by L.L. No. 1-1999; 11-15-1999 by L.L. No.
10-1999]
(2) Shall not be changed to another nonconforming use without a
special permit from the Village Board of Trustees and then only to a
use which, in the opinion of said Board, is of the same or a more
restricted nature.
(3) Shall not be reestablished if such use has been discontinued for any
reason for a period of one year or more or has been changed to or
replaced by a conforming use. Intent to resume a nonconforming
use shall not confer the right to do so.
B. Except as provided in Subsection D below, no building which houses a
nonconforming use shall be:
(1) Structurally altered or enlarged.
(2) Moved to another location where such use would be
nonconforming.
(3) Restored for other than a conforming use after damage from any
cause exceeding 50% of the replacement cost of such building,
exclusive of foundations. Any such building, damaged to a lesser
extent may be restored but not enlarged and the nonconforming
use reinstated within one year of such damage; if the restoration of
such building is not completed within said one-year period, the
nonconforming use of such building shall be deemed to have been
discontinued unless such nonconforming use is carried on without
interruption in the undamaged portion of such building.
C. Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration in or moving,
reconstruction or enlargement of a building which does not house a

nonconforming use but is nonconforming as to the district regulations
for lot area, lot width, front yard, side yard, rear yard, maximum height,
maximum lot coverage or minimum habitable floor area per dwelling
is permitted if the same does not increase the degree of or create any
new nonconformity with such regulations in such building. [Amended
1-21-1985 by L.L. No. 1-1985]
D. Nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent normal maintenance
and repair of any building, the carrying out upon the issuance of a
building permit of major structural alterations or demolitions necessary
in the interest of public safety. In granting such a permit, the Village
Engineer shall state the precise reason why such alterations were
deemed necessary.
E. Each of the nonconforming uses specified below is deemed sufficiently
objectionable, undesirable and out of character in the district in which
such use is located as to depreciate the value of other property and uses
permitted in the district and blight the proper and orderly development
and general welfare of such district and the Village to the point that
each of such nonconforming uses shall be terminated on or before the
expiration of the specified period of time after November 10, 1960,
which period of time as specified for the purpose of permitting the
amortization of the remaining values, if any, of such use shall be as
follows:
(1) In any residence district, any nonconforming use of open land,
including such uses as a parking lot, trailer, junkyard or open
storage yard for materials or equipment, may be continued for two
years after November 10, 1960, provided that on the expiration of
that period such nonconforming use shall be terminated.
(2) In any residence district, any sign not of a type permitted or of a
permitted type but greater than two times the maximum permitted
size may be continued for one year after November 10, 1960,
provided that on the expiration of that period such nonconforming
use shall be terminated.
(3) In any nonresidential district, any sign not of a type permitted or of
a permitted type but greater than two times the maximum
permitted size may be continued for two years after November 10,
1960, provided that on the expiration of that period such
nonconforming use shall be terminated.
A. In no event shall any use unlawfully established under the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson Zoning Ordinance of 1931 and the Zoning Map
constituting a part thereof, as said ordinance and Map shall have been
amended prior to adoption of this chapter, be deemed to be a
nonconforming use under this chapter.
§ 230-53 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-54
219:618
B. Any building, structure or use constructed in conformance with a site
development plan approved pursuant to the Riverfront Development
Use (RDU) District provisions, prior to their repeal from this chapter,
shall not be considered nonconforming in the context of this article of
this chapter. However, said building, structure or use shall continue to
be bound by said approved site development plan. [Added 2-16-1999

residential decks and patios, walkways and gardens is not subject
to site plan review.
(2) Any enlargement of a single-family or two-family home that brings
the total habitable floor area to 80% or more of the maximum
permitted habitable floor area. The maximum habitable floor area
is calculated by multiplying the maximum FAR in that zoning
district by the lot size. When any enlargement of a single-family or
two-family home is subject to minor site plan review, then the
structures accessory to that single-family or two-family home, such
as garages, are subject to minor site plan review as well.
(3) Any proposed clearing of trees or earthwork on any property
involving 20% or more of the site.

afford the best solution to any drainage problems.
(6) In specific cases where the Planning Board finds that the maximum
setback distances from the front, side or rear lot lines fail to
maintain adequately the residential characteristics of surrounding
residential properties, if any, it may require that such distances be
increased, but in no case may it reduce said minimum setbacks.
(7) Location, arrangement, appearance and sufficiency of the off-street
parking and loading.

(11) The preservation of scenic views and vistas, consistent with
reasonable use of property, particularly to the Hudson and Croton
Rivers.
(12) Quality of architectural features. The following criteria are
intended to provide a framework within which the Planning Board
may judge the appropriateness of the project to the neighborhood
context and, for renovations, to assess the compatibility of the
proposed addition with the existing exterior building. The criteria
are also designed to enable the designer of the project to exercise
creativity and innovation.
(a) Site development: the orientation, setback, alignment, spacing
and placement of all buildings, and structures.
(b) Building design:
[1] Scale and proportion. The height, width, bulk and general
proportions of the development, the ratio of wall surface to
openings, and the ratio of the width and height of windows
and doors.
[2] Setback and orientation. The setback of the building,
accessory structures, and retaining walls, and the
orientation of the proposed building to the setbacks on the
§ 230-70 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-70
219:632
lot, as well as to the setbacks of proximate buildings and
the common street setback.

nondirectional facade character of the proposed building
or addition, and its relationship to the existing building
and/or proximate structures.
[4] Windows and doors. The pattern of placement and
proportions of windows and doors, and their relationship
with that of the existing building and other structures in
the two-hundred-foot vicinity of the building.
[5] Roof form. Roof form should be in proportion to the
structure and should relate to the materials and
construction of the existing building and structures in the
two-hundred-foot vicinity.
[6] Features and details. Balconies, decks, covered porches,
bracketed eaves, columns, balustrades, towers, turrets,
skylights, and arches should be in proportion to each
other.
[7] Wall materials. Walls should be constructed of natural
materials such as masonry, stone or wood, or of synthetic
materials that are selected for harmony with natural
materials.
[8] Lighting. All lighting should be appropriate to the building
and its surroundings in terms of style, scale and intensity
of illumination. Low-wattage systems are preferred. Site
lighting should be shielded to prevent glare or spillage
onto adjoining properties.
[9] Diversity of design. The designs for proposed new
buildings should avoid:
[a] Overly repetitive use of identical architectural
features such as facade openings, cornice lines, etc.
[b] Overly similar treatment of building elevations.
[c] Excessive identical replication of the architectural
style or treatment existing in surrounding buildings.
[10] Historic quality. The building's value within the historic
district or landmark fabric of the Village (i.e., built before
1931), or listed on, or determined eligible for, the state
and/or National Register of Historic Places, or designated
as a historic site or property by Westchester County.

assessment of all costs and expenses so incurred by the Village in
connection with any action taken by the Village to be placed as a lien
against the property and included in the following year's Village tax
levied on the property.
C. Enforcement of violation notice. Whenever the notice of violation has
not been complied with within the thirty-day period after mailing of the
same, the Board of Trustees shall, by resolution, direct the Department

[Adopted 1-31-2005 by L.L. No. 1-2005149]
§ 230-120. Approval required; adoption of regulations.
§ 230-121. Definitions.
For the purposes of the regulations governing applications for and approval
of plans for subdivisions, the following definitions shall apply:
SUBDIVISION 
TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP  A map showing ground elevations by contour
lines and the location of important natural and other objects.
§ 230-122. (Reserved)150
A. Pursuant to resolutions of the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Croton-on-Hudson and pursuant to the provisions of the Village Law, it
is required that all plans showing new streets or highways and all plans
of subdividing of land must be approved by the Planning Board of the
Village of Croton-on-Hudson.
B. The following regulations concerning such plans are hereby adopted by
the Planning Board of such Village.
C. The Village Board of Trustees shall be empowered, in its discretion, to
waive any and all requirements, conditions and payments prescribed in
this chapter in the case of an action that is a subdivision solely because
it affects more than two lots but does not increase the number of
preexisting buildable lots nor create a new lot that is not buildable
without a variance or special permit.
Subject to Subsection B below, any act which creates a lot line where
none existed before or which removes a lot line where one existed
before or a lease of 10 years or more covering only a portion of a lot
where the property is substantially unimproved and is being leased for
development.
A.
Notwithstanding Subsection A above, no act shall be deemed to
constitute a subdivision if it meets the following three conditions:
(1) It neither increases nor decreases the number of preexisting lots.
(2) It affects no more than two lots.
It does not result in any nonconformity with this Chapter 230,
Zoning, of the Code.
(3)

§ 230-123. Areas for parks and playgrounds.
A. Sites required. In subdividing property, provisions should be made for
the laying out of suitable sites for parks and playgrounds. Where
possible, 10% of the total area of the subdivision should be allotted for
this purpose, except where such 10% amounts to less than 1/4 acre, and
no recreation plot shall be less than 1/4 acre in size.
B. Money in lieu of recreation land. Whenever the Planning Board of the
Village, in approving a plat showing lots, blocks or sites, with or without
streets or highways, determines that a suitable park or parks of
adequate size cannot be properly located in any such plat or is
otherwise not practical, there shall be paid to the Village a sum of
money to be used for neighborhood park, playground or recreation
purposes, including the acquisition of land for such purposes, to be
computed in accordance with the following formula and subject to the
following conditions:
(1) For every subdivision in an RA or RB district, a fee set by resolution
of the Board of Trustees shall be paid to the Department of
Engineering.
(2) No sum of money shall be payable in lieu of park, playground or
recreation land in relation to any lot which, on September 15, 1986,
is already improved with a residential dwelling.
(3) Payment of a sum of money in lieu of land for park, playground or
recreation purposes shall be made to the Village by the applicant
for plat approval by the Planning Board or proprietor or developer
of the lot or lots, at his option, either at the time of plat approval by
the Planning Board or at the time of the issuance of a building
permit by the Village Engineer and in conformity with whatever
formula may be in force pursuant to a resolution of the Board of
Trustees of the Village at the time of payment of the sum of money
in lieu of land for park, playground or recreation land.
(4) The formula and conditions set forth above shall be applicable only
to plats in RA and RB Zoning Districts. In regard to plats in other
zoning districts as to which the Planning Board of the Village has,
on approval, determined that a suitable park or parks of adequate
size cannot be properly located in such plats or is otherwise not
practical, a sum of money in lieu of park, playground or recreation
land shall be paid to the Village in an amount to be determined by
the Board of Trustees in each case on the basis of the facts and
circumstances of that case and after consideration of such
recommendations as the Planning Board may have made.
(5) All funds paid in lieu of recreation land shall constitute a trust fund
to be used by the Village of Croton-on-Hudson exclusively for park,

§ 230-162. Powers and duties.
The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have all the powers and duties
prescribed by law and by this chapter, which are more particularly specified
as follows, provided that none of the following provisions shall be deemed
to limit any power of said Board that is conferred by law:
A. Interpretation. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official or on request by any
official, board or agency of the Village, the Zoning Board of Appeals
may reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, interpretation or determination made by the
administrative official charged with the enforcement of such local law
and may decide any of the following questions:
(1) Determination of the meaning of any portion of the text of this
chapter or of any condition or requirement specified or made under
the provisions of this chapter.
(2) Determination of the exact location of any district boundary shown
on the Zoning Map.
B. Special permits. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power to
grant special permits for commercial district signage, as set out in
156. Editor's Note: This local law also renumbered original Art. XIV, Amendments and
Interpretation, as new Art. XVI.
157. Editor's Note: See § 7-712 of the Village Law.
§ 230-160 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-162
219:653
§ 230-44P(4)(a)[4]. On application and after public notice and hearing,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall authorize the issuance by the Village
Engineer of special permits for any of the uses for which this chapter
requires, in the district in which such use is proposed to be located,
the granting of such permits by the Board of Appeals. In authorizing
the issuance of a special permit, the Board shall take into consideration
the public health, safety and welfare and shall prescribe appropriate
conditions and safeguards to ensure the accomplishment of the
following objectives:
(1) All proposed structures, equipment or material shall be readily
accessible for fire and police protection.
(2) The proposed use shall be of such location, size and character that,
in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly
development of the district in which it is proposed to be situated
and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent
properties in accordance with the zoning classification of such
properties.
(3) In addition to the above, in the case of any use located in or directly
adjacent to a residential district:
(a) The location and size of such use, the nature and intensity of
operations involved in or conducted in connection therewith,
its site layout and its relation to access streets shall be such
that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use
and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not
be hazardous or inconvenient to or incongruous with said
residential districts or conflict with the normal traffic of the
neighborhood.
(b) The location and height of buildings, the location, nature and
height of walls and fences and the nature and extent of
landscaping on the site shall be such that the use will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings or impair the value thereof.
(4) In authorizing the issuance of a special permit, it shall be the duty
of the Board to attach such conditions and safeguards as may be
required in order that the result of its action may, to the maximum
extent possible, further the general objectives of this chapter. The
Board may require that special permits be periodically renewed.
Such renewal shall be granted following due public notice and
hearing and may be withheld only upon a determination by the
Village Engineer to the effect that such conditions as may have
been prescribed by the Board in conjunction with the issuance of
the original permit have not been or are no longer being complied
with. In such cases a period of 60 days shall be granted the
applicant for full compliance prior to the revocation of said permit.
Any use for which a special permit may be granted shall be deemed
§ 230-162 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-162
219:654
to be a conforming use in the district in which such use is located,
provided that:
(a) The provision in this chapter under which such permit was
issued is still in effect.
(b) Such permit was issued in conformity with the provisions of
this chapter.
(c) Such permit shall be deemed to affect only the lot or portion
thereof for which such permit shall have been granted.
C. Use variances.
(1) Use variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals is empowered to grant
use variances as defined in § 230-160 of this article.
(2) No use variance shall be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Zoning Board of Appeals that for each and
every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located, the following four criteria
are satisfied:
(a) The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that
lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by competent
financial evidence;
(b) That the alleged hardship relating to the property in question
is unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
(c) That the requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) That the alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to
address the unnecessary hardship proved by the applicant, and at
the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
D. Area variances.
(1) Area variances. The Zoning Board of Appeals is empowered to
grant area variances as defined in § 230-160 of this article.
(2) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and
§ 230-162 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-162
219:655
§ 230-163. Filing and appeal of administrative decisions.
welfare of the neighborhood or community by such a grant. The
Zoning Board of Appeals shall also consider:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method, feasible for the applicant to pursue, other
than an area variance;
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Zoning
Board of Appeals but shall not necessarily preclude the
granting of the area variance.
E. Additional conditions for use and area variances.
(1) The needs or desires of a particular owner or tenant or of a
particular prospective owner or tenant shall not, either alone or in
conjunction with other factors, afford any basis for the granting of a
variance. The fact that the improvements already existing at the
time of the application are old, obsolete, outmoded or in disrepair
or the fact that the property is then unimproved shall not be
deemed to make the plight of the property unique or to contribute
thereto.
(2) Where the Zoning Board of Appeals finds the zoning classification
of a particular property to be conducive to the deprivation of the
reasonable use of the land or building by the owner thereof and
where the Zoning Board of Appeals deems the same condition to
apply generally to other land or buildings in the same
neighborhood or district, said Board may call this condition to the
attention of the Board of Trustees.
(3) In all cases where the Zoning Board of Appeals grants a variance
from the strict application of the requirements of this chapter, it
shall be the duty of such Board to attach conditions and safeguards
as may be required in order that the result of its action may be as
nearly as possible in accordance with the spirit and intent of this
chapter.
A. Filing of administrative decisions. Each order, requirement, decision,
interpretation or determination of the administrative official charged
§ 230-162 CROTON-ON-HUDSON CODE § 230-163
219:656
§ 230-164. Zoning Board of Appeals procedure.
The powers and duties of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be exercised in
accordance with the following procedures:
with the enforcement of the local zoning law shall be filed in the office
of such administrative official within five business days from the day it
is rendered and made a public record.
B. Appeal of administrative decisions. Appeals shall be taken within 60
days after the filing of any order, requirement, decision, interpretation
or determination of the administrative official by filing with the
administrative official and with the Zoning Board of Appeals a notice of
appeal specifying the grounds of appeal and relief sought. The
administrative official shall transmit to the Zoning Board of Appeals all
papers constituting the record upon which the appealed action was
taken.
C. Stay upon appeal. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of
the action appealed from, unless the administrative official certifies to
the Zoning Board of Appeals after notice of appeal has been filed with
said official that a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property, in
which case proceedings shall not be appealed other than by a
restraining order which may be granted by the Zoning Board of Appeals
or by a court of record on application.
A. Meetings, minutes, records. Meetings of the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall be open to the public to the extent provided in Article 7 of the
Public Officers Law. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall keep minutes of
its proceedings, showing the vote of each member upon every question,
or if absent and failing to vote, indicating such fact, and shall also keep
records of its examinations and other official actions.
B. Notice of hearing, property owners. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall
not grant any appeal for a variance or issue any special or temporary
permit without first holding a public hearing, notice of which hearing
and of the substance of the appeal or application shall be given by
publication in the official newspaper of the Village at least 10 days
before that date of such hearing. In addition to such published notice,
the Zoning Board of Appeals shall cause notice to be given of the
substance of every appeal for a variance and of every application for a
special permit, together with notice of the hearing thereon, by causing
notices thereof to be mailed by postal card or other means at least 10
days before the day of said hearing to the owners of all property
abutting that held by the applicant in the immediate area, whether or
not involved in such appeal or application, and all other owners within
200 feet, or such additional distances as the Zoning Board of Appeals
may deem advisable, from the exterior boundaries of the land involved
in such appeal or application, as the names of said owners appear on
the last completed assessment roll of the Village; provided, however,
that in the case of variance applications for fences or walls, notices
§ 230-163 VEHICLES, UNLICENSED MOTOR-DRIVEN § 230-164
219:657
shall only be required to be mailed to owners of properties immediately
abutting, and directly across the street from, the exterior boundaries of
the land involved in such applications. Any or all of the notices required
by this section shall be issued by the office of the Village Clerk on order
of the Zoning Board of Appeals or upon order of the Chairman of said
Board if the appeal or application is received when the Board is not in
session and the Chairman deems it necessary or desirable to expedite
the public hearing on such appeal or application. Provided that due
notice shall have been published as above provided and that there shall
have been substantial compliance with the remaining provisions of this
subsection, the failure to give notice in exact conformance herewith
shall not be deemed to invalidate action taken by the Zoning Board
of Appeals in connection with the granting of any appeal or variance
or issuance of any special or temporary permit pursuant thereto.
[Amended 3-6-2017 by L.L. No. 1-2017]
C. Notice of hearing, Westchester County and regional councils. Ten days'
notice by mail shall be given in accordance with the provisions of
§§ 277.61 and 277.62 of the Westchester County Administrative Code,
as such sections may from time to time be amended or superseded, in
all cases where notice is required thereby. If applicable, the Zoning
Board of Appeals shall mail notices of the hearing at least five days
before the hearing to the state park commission having jurisdiction
over any state park or parkway within 500 feet of the property affected
by the appeal. The notice shall be accompanied by a full statement of
the proposed action, as defined in § 239-m of the General Municipal
Law.
D. Notice of hearing, Planning Board. At least 10 days before the date of
any public hearing, the Secretary of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
transmit to the Secretary of the Planning Board a copy of any appeal or
application, together with a copy of the notice of such hearing. The
Planning Board may submit to the Zoning Board of Appeals an advisory
opinion on said appeal or application at any time prior to the public
hearing.

the date of the granting of a variance or special permit, such variance
or special permit shall become null and void.

made to the Zoning Board of Appeals shall be in writing and on forms
prescribed by the Board and approved by the Planning Board. Ten
copies of the application and supporting documentation shall be
submitted by the applicant, accompanied by a fee in an amount set from
time to time by resolution of the Board of Trustees.158 The Zoning Board
of Appeals may, in its discretion, return to the applicant part or all the
fee paid by him or her in the event that his or her appeal under
§ 230-162A, Interpretation, hereof is partially or wholly successful. The

not be returnable regardless of disposition of the case by the Zoning
Board of Appeals.

application shall fully set forth the circumstances of the case. Each
application for a special permit shall be accompanied by a proposed
plan showing the size and location of the lot, a site plan showing the
location of all buildings and proposed facilities, including access drives,
parking areas, landscaping and all streets within 200 feet. Every appeal
or application shall refer to the specific provision of this chapter and
shall exactly set forth, as the case may be, the interpretation that is
claimed, the details of the variance that is applied for and the grounds
on which it is claimed that the same should be granted, or the use for
which the special permit is sought.
H. Time frame of decision. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall decide upon
the appeal within 62 days after the hearing. The time within which the

K. Rehearing. Any member of the Zoning Board of Appeals may make a
motion to hold a rehearing on any order or determination of the Board
not previously reheard. A unanimous vote of all members of the Board
then present is required for such rehearing to occur. The rehearing is
subject to the same notice provisions as the original hearing. Upon such
rehearing, the Board may reverse, modify or annul its original order,
decision or determination upon the unanimous vote of all members then
present, provided the Board finds that the rights vested in persons
acting in good faith in reliance upon the reheard order, decision or
determination will not be prejudiced thereby.
L. Voting requirements.

of this article, every motion or resolution by the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall require for its adoption the affirmative vote of a
majority of all the members of the Zoning Board of Appeals, as fully
constituted regardless of vacancies or absences. Where an action is
the subject of a referral to the county planning agency, the voting
provisions of § 239-m of the General Municipal Law shall apply.
(2) Default denial of appeal. In exercising its appellate jurisdiction
only, if an affirmative vote of a majority of all members of the
Zoning Board of Appeals is not attained on a motion or a resolution
to grant a variance or reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of the enforcement official within the time allowed
by § 230-164H of this article, the appeal is denied. The Zoning
Board of Appeals may amend the failed motion or resolution and
vote on the amended motion or resolution within the time allowed
without being subject to the rehearing process as set forth in
§ 230-164K of this article.
M. All provisions of this chapter relating to the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall be strictly construed; the Board, as a body of limited jurisdiction,
shall act in full conformity with all provisions of law and of this chapter
and in strict compliance with all limitation contained therein; provided,
however, that if the procedural requirements set forth in this chapter
have been substantially observed, no applicant or appellant shall be
deprived of the right of application or appeal.

in any district unless the applicant for the building permit has provided
or undertakes to provide, at no expense to the Village, facilities
satisfactory to the Village Engineer for the supply of water and the
removal or treatment of sewage. An undertaking for the future
provision of such facilities shall be supported by a one-hundred-percent
performance bond. Where approval of the subdivision plat or site
development plan by the Planning Board is required, particulars of such
facilities shall be indicated on the plat or plan.

the action taken consequent on each such complaint, which records
shall be public records.
C. If, in the judgment of the Village Engineer, a building under
construction is sited so close to a required setback line as to create a
reasonable possibility that in the construction process the building will
intrude upon the required setback, then the Village Engineer is
empowered to require the owner to provide an as-built survey after the
foundation is poured and before any additional construction proceeds,
and his notice to that effect to the owner or builder shall operate to
suspend construction until such as-built survey is furnished to him and
he determines that no intrusion into the required setback or other
