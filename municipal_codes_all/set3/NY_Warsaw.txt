§ 3-1. Authority.
Authorization for this article is granted under New York State General
Municipal Law Article 5-G and Village Law, Article 7, § 7-741, Subdivision
4(a).
§ 3-2. Legislative purpose and intent.
There is little argument that sharing services on a voluntary basis often
makes good sense and efforts to expand the number and variety of
cooperative services should be encouraged. Over the years, it has become
increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of individuals willing to
accept appointments to the respective Planning Boards of the Village and
Town of Warsaw. The economy and efficiency of a Joint Planning Board is
advantageous to both the Town and Village. The Town and the Village find
that it would be in the best interests of the residents of both municipalities
for a Joint Planning Board to be created pursuant to the authority cited
above.
§ 3-3. Establishment; members.
A. The Village of Warsaw is authorized to create, in accordance with an
intermunicipal agreement with the Town of Warsaw, a Joint Planning
Board consisting of seven members:
(1) Three of which will be appointed by the Town (from outside the
Village);
(2) Three of which will be appointed by the Village (from inside the
Village); and
(3) One will be appointed by the Town and the Village.
B. The initial appointment of representatives from the Village will be for:
(1) A term of one year;
(2) A term of three years; and
(3) A term of four years.
C. The initial appointment of representatives from the Town will be for:
(1) A term of two years;
(2) A term of four years; and
(3) A term of five years.
§ 3-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 3-3

§ 3-4. Intermunicipal agreement.
Immediately following the enactment of this article, the Village of Warsaw
shall enter into an intermunicipal agreement with the Town of Warsaw.
All matters currently pending before the Planning Board of the Village of
Warsaw shall be transferred to the Joint Planning Board.
§ 3-5. Severability.
If any part of this article is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or
invalid, such decision shall not affect the remainder of this article. The
Village hereby declares that it would have passed this article and each
section and subsection thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or
more of these sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases may be
declared unconstitutional or invalid.
§ 3-6. Precedence.
This article and its provisions are in addition to all other applicable laws,
rules and regulations.
D. The initial appointment of the jointly appointed representative will be
for:
(1) A term of five years.
E. At the expiration of each term thereafter, successors to these positions
shall be appointed for terms of five years.
F. At the expiration of each original appointment to the Joint Planning
Board, vacant Town positions will be filled through appointment by the
Town, vacant Village positions will be filled through appointment by the
Village, and the vacant joint position will be appointed jointly by the
Village and the Town. However, in the event either municipality is
unable to fill appointments from their respective subdivision, both
parties hereto agree to honor appointments from the Town or Village in
an effort to maintain a viable Joint Planning Board.
G. If a vacancy shall occur in an unexpired term, appointment will be made
by the respective municipality from which that member was appointed
to fill the vacancy for the remainder of the unexpired term. However, if
either municipality is unable to fill a vacancy from their respective
political subdivision, both parties hereto agree to honor appointments
from the Town or Village in an effort to maintain a viable Planning
Board.
H. The Mayor of the Village of Warsaw shall have the power to remove
members appointed by the Village of Warsaw, subject to the provisions
of § 7-718 of the Village Law of the State of New York.

Municipal Law Article 5-G and Village Law, Article 7 § 7-741, Subdivision
4(b).
§ 3-9. Legislative purpose and intent.
There is little argument that sharing services on a voluntary basis often
makes good sense and efforts to expand the number and variety of
cooperative services should be encouraged. Over the years, it has become
increasingly difficult to obtain sufficient numbers of individuals willing to
accept appointments to the respective Zoning Boards of Appeals of the

of both municipalities for a Joint Zoning Board of Appeals to be created
pursuant to the authority cited above.

intermunicipal agreement with the Town of Warsaw, a Joint Zoning

All ordinances, local laws and parts thereof inconsistent with this article are
hereby repealed, including, but not limited to, Local Law No. 1 of 1988.

If any part of this article is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or
invalid, such decision shall not affect the remainder of this article. The
Village hereby declares that it would have passed this article and each

more of these sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases may be
declared unconstitutional or invalid.
D. The initial appointment of the jointly appointed representative will be

DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Code of Ethics  See Ch. 11.
§ 7-1. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection for
those individuals serving the Village of Warsaw from losses which may be
brought against them in their individual capacities for actions taken while
in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. In enacting
this chapter, the Board of Trustees finds that the State of New York has
enacted similar provisions for the legal and financial security of its officers
and employees and further finds that such security is also required for local
personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Board of Trustees does not
intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right or responsibility of
the village or its employees with regard to indemnification or legal defense.
It is solely the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage for local
employees as is presently provided for state employees, so as to continue to
attract qualified individuals to local government service.
§ 7-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following
terms shall have the meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE  Any person holding a position by election, appointment
or employment in the service of the Village of Warsaw, whether or not
compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to participate in a
municipally sponsored volunteer program but shall not include an
independent contractor. The term "employee" shall include a former
employee, his estate or judicially appointed personal representative.
§ 7-3. Provisions for defense by village.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 7-5 of this
chapter, the village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any
civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any
alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his
public employment duties or which is brought to enforce a provision of
42 U.S.C. § 1981 or 1983. This duty to provide for a defense shall not
arise where such civil action or proceeding is brought by or on behalf of
the Village of Warsaw.
§ 3-15 WARSAW CODE § 7-3
1:16
§ 7-4. Indemnification.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the
employee shall be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney;
provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to
representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial
proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based upon his
investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case, that
representation by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate or
whenever a court of competent jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or
by a special proceeding, determines that a conflict of interest exists and
that the employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel of his
choice. The Village Attorney shall notify the employee, in writing, of
such determination that the employee is entitled to be represented by
private counsel of his choice. The Village Attorney may require, as a
condition to payment of the fees and expenses of such representation,
that appropriate groups of such employees be represented by the same
counsel. If the employee or group of employees is entitled to
representation by private counsel under the provisions of this chapter,
the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Village Board. Reasonable
attorneys' fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the village to
such private counsel from time to time during the pendency of the civil
action or proceeding, subject to certification that the employee is
entitled to representation under the terms and conditions of this
chapter by the head of the department, commission, division, office or
agency in which such employee is employed and upon the audit and
warrant of the Village Treasurer. Any dispute with respect to
representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or the amount
of litigation expenses or the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be
resolved by the court upon motion or by way of a special proceeding.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Village Attorney as required by § 7-5 of this chapter, the Attorney shall
take the necessary steps, including the retention of private counsel
under the terms and conditions provided in Subsection B of this section,
on behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment, pending
resolution of any question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a
defense.
A. The village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state
or federal court or in the amount of any settlement of a claim, provided
that the act or omission from which such judgment or settlement arose
occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his public
employment or duties. The duty to indemnify and save harmless
prescribed by this section shall not arise where the injury or damage
resulted from intentional wrongdoing or recklessness on the part of the
employee.
§ 7-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 7-4
1:17
§ 7-5. Conditions.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this chapter
shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Village Attorney or his assistant,
at his office, by the employee of the original or a copy of any summons,
complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within five days after he is
served with such document and upon the full cooperation of the employee
in the defense of such action or proceeding and in defense of any action
or proceeding against the village based upon the same act or omission and
in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request
by the employee that the village provide for his defense pursuant to this
chapter.
§ 7-6. Limitation on applicability.
The benefits of this chapter shall inure only to employees as defined herein
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any
provision of this chapter be construed to affect, alter or repeal any provision
of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 7-7. Effect on insurers.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
§ 7-8. Effect on pending proceedings.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all actions and proceedings
pending upon the effective date thereof or thereafter instituted.
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Board of Trustees any proposed settlement which may
be subject to indemnification by the village, and if not inconsistent with
the provisions of this chapter, the Mayor shall certify such settlement
and submit such settlement and certification to the Village Attorney.
The Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as to form and
amount and shall give his approval if, in his judgment, the settlement is
in the best interest of the village. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to authorize the village to indemnify or save harmless an
employee with respect to a settlement not so reviewed and approved by
the Village Attorney.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail, within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the Mayor;
and if not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter, such
judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such Mayor. If
the Attorney concurs in such certification, the judgment or settlement
shall be paid upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer.

§ 7-9. Construal of provisions.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the provisions
of this chapter shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit,
modify, abrogate or restrict any immunity available to or conferred upon
any unit, entity, officer or employee of the village or any right to defense
and/or indemnification provided for any government officer or employee by,
in accordance with or by reason of any other provision of state or federal
statutory or common law.

maintained in our unit of local government. It is the purpose of this chapter

of the Village of Warsaw. These rules shall serve as a guide for the official
conduct of the officers and employees of the Village of Warsaw. The rules of

the fixing at any time of fees based upon the reasonable value of the
services rendered.

RESIDENCY REQUIREMENTS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Code of Ethics  See Ch. 11. Officers and employees  See Ch. 21.
§ 27-1. Purpose.
The legislative body of the Village of Warsaw notes that unemployment
within the community is currently rising. It further recognizes that
emergency work situations arise which require employees of the Village
of Warsaw to be near their place of employment and to assume the
continuation of public services to protect the health, safety and general
welfare of the people. Through the adoption of this chapter, the Village
Board makes a legislative determination that those who are residents of
the community take a greater interest in promoting the public safety and
health and in the future of this community than do nonresidents whose
families reside in areas unaffected by community services. The Village
Board further declares that such a quality is desirable for its employees.
The legislative body considers that residency by its employees and officers
within a community will strengthen the economic status of the community
and will encourage stability in its neighborhoods and assure continuation
of essential public services. Pursuant to the authority of law and pursuant
to determinations by the State Public Employment Relations Board, the
Village Board determines that the public need is sufficient to require that
employees hired after the effective date of this chapter be residents of the
community.
§ 27-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
COMMUNITY  The area within the limits of the Township of Warsaw.
RESIDENCY  The actual principal domicile of an individual, where he or
she normally eats or sleeps and maintains usual personal and household
effects.
§ 27-3. Residency requirement.
A. The Village Board hereby establishes a residency requirement for all
employees of the Village. Every person employed or promoted by the
Village of Warsaw on or after July 1, 1982, shall be a resident of the
community of Warsaw or shall become a resident within six months of
the date of completion of his or her probationary period for the Village.
During the time of service of such employees, no individual shall cease
to be a resident of the community. This chapter shall be applicable to all
§ 21-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 27-3
1:27
§ 27-4. Termination of service.
Should it be alleged that an employee subject to the provisions of § 27-3
of this chapter is no longer a resident of the community, the Mayor, upon
becoming aware of the allegation, shall provide the employee written notice
of his alleged violation and shall allow the employee seven calendar days
in which to respond. Regardless of whether or not a response is received,
a hearing date shall be determined to examine the charge of nonresidency.
The employee shall be sent a notice of the hearing date 15 days prior to the
hearing. Upon a determination by a hearing officer or by a board conducting
the hearing that the employee is a nonresident in violation of this chapter,
the employee will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned.

employees regardless of civil service classification, except as follows:
[Amended 2-19-2013 by L.L. No. 2-2013]
(1) Residency requirements shall not apply to any full-time and/or parttime
police officers of the Village of Warsaw Police Department. All
full-time and part-time police officers must live within the County of
Wyoming.
B. Except for the case of promotion, the provisions of this chapter do not
apply to Village employees hired prior to July 1, 1982.
C. A copy of this chapter shall be provided to all employees upon hiring or
promotion. However, the failure of the employer to do so shall not affect
the applicability of this chapter to any employee hired after its effective
date. A copy of this chapter shall also be posted on all notice boards
normally used by the employer for employee communications.
A. In the event that the Village Board determines that it is in the best
interests of the Village to do so, the provisions of § 27-3 may be waived
with respect to a particular person or a particular position in
accordance with these standards:
(1) Lack of applicants. The requirement of residency may be waived in
those instances where the Village has difficulty hiring persons
because of the residency requirement.
(2) Necessity for nonresidency. The requirement of residency may be
waived in those instances where it is determined that residency is
not in the best interests of the Village.
B. Such a waiver shall not in any way affect the application of § 27-3 of this
chapter to any other person or position.

§ 36-1. Findings; statement of policy.
In the development and execution of this chapter, it is recognized that there
are some uses which, because of their very nature, are recognized as having
serious objectionable operational characteristics, that such activities are
deleterious to the health, welfare and well-being of the Village of Warsaw
and those who live within the village and that the concentration of such
activities in any one area can and does adversely and seriously endanger
the adjacent areas thereto. It is further recognized that the location of these
uses in regard to areas where our youth may regularly assemble and the
general atmosphere encompassing their operation is of great concern to
the Village of Warsaw. Therefore, it is recognized that special regulation of
these uses is necessary to ensure that the adverse effects will not contribute
to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighborhoods or land
uses and to prevent their accessibility to minors.

indicated:

significant portion of its stock-in-trade books, magazines, films for sale or

coin-operated means, and other periodicals which are distinguished or
characterized by their emphasis on matter depicting, describing or relating

ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW
§ 70-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to implement for the Village of Warsaw the
State Environmental Quality Review Act and 6 NYCRR 617.
§ 70-2. Definitions.
§ 70-3. Compliance with standards.
No action, other than an exempt, excluded or Type II action, shall be carried
out, approved or funded by any agency, board, body or officer of the village,
unless it has complied with SEQR and Part 617 to the extent applicable to
this chapter.
§ 70-4. Determination of environmental significance;
commencement of running and approval time.
A. The terms and words used in this chapter shall have the same meanings
as such terms and words are defined in Article 8 of the Environmental
Conservation Law and 6 NYCRR 617, unless the context requires a
different meaning.
B. The following terms, as used in this chapter, shall have the meanings
indicated:
EAF  Environmental assessment form.
EIS  Environmental impact statement.
PART 617  The rules and regulations set forth in 6 NYCRR 617.
SEQR  The State Environmental Quality Review Act as set forth in
Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law.
VILLAGE  The Village of Warsaw.
A. An EAF shall be prepared by or on behalf of any agency, board, body or
officer of the village in connection with any Type I action which such
agency, board, body or officer contemplates or proposes to carry out
directly. For an unlisted action, an EAF in a short or long form may be
prepared to facilitate a preliminary determination of environmental
significance.
B. An application for permit or funding of a Type I action shall be
accompanied by an EAF and for an unlisted action may be accompanied
by a short form EAF as may be needed to assist the lead agency in
making a preliminary determination of environmental significance. An
applicant may prepare a draft EIS to accompany the application in
place of the EAF. In lieu of an EAF, the Village Board or a lead agency
§ 66-21 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-4
1:65
§ 70-5. Procedure.
If the lead agency determines that an EIS is required, it shall proceed
as provided in Sections 617.8, 617.9 and 617.10. Commencing with the
acceptance of the draft EIS, the time limitations for processing the EIS
shall run concurrently with the time limitations applicable to processing
the application for approval or funding of the action, and a public hearing
on the draft EIS, if any, shall be held concurrently with any hearing to be
held on such application. The draft EIS shall be prepared by the applicant.
Failure by the applicant to prepare an EIS acceptable to the lead agency
shall, at the option of the lead agency, be deemed an abandonment and
discontinuance of the application.
§ 70-6. Determination and designation of lead agency.
The lead agency shall be determined and designated as provided in Sections
617.6 and 617.7, except that, in the following Type I and unlisted actions,
the lead agency shall be as provided herein:
having authority to adopt its own regulations may adopt a different
procedure for reviewing environmental significance of unlisted actions.
The lead agency shall make a preliminary determination of the
environmental significance of the action on the basis of the EAF, draft
EIS or, with respect to unlisted actions, in accordance with its own
procedures, as the case may be, and such other information it requires.
Such determination shall be made within 15 days of its designation
as lead agency or within 15 days of its receipt of all information it
requires, whichever is later. For Type I actions, a determination of
nonsignificance shall be noticed and filed as provided in Section
617.10(b); for unlisted actions, a determination of nonsignificance shall
be sent to the applicant and maintained in accordance with Sections
617.7(e) and 617.10(f). After a determination of nonsignificance, the
action, including one involving a permit or funding, shall be processed
without further regard to SEQR, Part 617 or this chapter.
C. The time of filing an application for approval or funding of an action
shall commence to run from the date the preliminary determination of
environmental nonsignificance is rendered or, if in lieu of an EAF the
applicant prepares a draft EIS, from the date the applicant files a draft
EIS acceptable to the lead agency.
A. The adoption, amendment or change in zoning regulations not
requiring a federal or state agency permit or approval: the Village
Board.
B. The construction or expansion of village buildings, structures and
facilities within the village not requiring a federal or state agency
permit or approval: the Village Board.
C. Variances not requiring a federal or state agency permit or approval:
the Zoning Board of Appeals.
§ 70-4 WARSAW CODE § 70-6
1:66
§ 70-7. Village Board to act as clearinghouse.
The Village Board shall act as the village clearinghouse for lead agency
designation. Such clearinghouse shall assist agencies and applicants in
identifying other agencies, including federal and state, that may be involved
in approving, funding or carrying out Type I and unlisted actions. The
clearinghouse shall also make recommendations on the designation of a
lead agency.
§ 70-8. Processing of actions involving federal agency.
Environmental review of actions involving a federal agency shall be
processed in accordance with Section 617.16.
§ 70-9. Fees.
The fees for review or preparation of an EIS involving an applicant for
approval or funding of an action shall be fixed from time to time by
resolution of the Village Board. (Section 617.17 prescribes limitations on
the amount of fees. If the applicant prepares the EIS, the village may charge
a fee for actual expenses of reviewing it, but if a village agency prepares an
EIS on behalf of an applicant, it may charge a fee for the cost of preparing,
including publication of notices, but not for the cost of professional review.)
§ 70-10. Designation of critical areas of environmental concern.
Critical areas of environmental concern may be designated by resolution of
the Village Board in accordance with Section 617.4(j).
§ 70-11. Designation of Type I actions.
D. The purchase, sale and lease of real property by the village not
requiring a federal or state agency permit or approval: the Village
Board.
E. A planned unit development or cluster zoning not requiring a federal or
state agency permit or approval: the Village Planning Board.
F. A site plan review and special use permit not requiring a federal or
state agency permit or approval: the Village Planning Board.
G. The construction or expansion of a nonresidential facility not requiring
a federal or state agency permit or approval: the Zoning Officer.
H. A parking lot not requiring a federal or state agency permit or approval:
the Zoning Officer.
A. The actions listed in this section are deemed Type I actions in addition
to those set forth in Section 617.12.
B. The purpose of the list of actions identified as Type I in this section is to
identify for agencies, project sponsors and the public those actions and
§ 70-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-11
1:67
projects that are more likely to require the preparation of EIS's than
those not so listed (i.e., unlisted actions). This Type I list is not
exhaustive of those actions that an agency may determine have a
significant effect on the environment and require the preparation of an
EIS. Therefore, the fact that an action or project has not been listed as
a Type I action does not carry with it the presumption that it will not
have a significant effect on the environment. For all individual actions
which are Type I or unlisted, the determination of significance must
be made by comparing the impacts which may be reasonably expected
to result from the proposed action with the criteria listed in Section
617.11. The Type I actions on this list are considered more likely to
require the preparations of an EIS than other actions and are likely to
involve review by more than one governmental agency, and therefore
the procedural requirements for Type I actions (Section 617.6) are
more extensive than for those unlisted actions (Section 617.7).
C. The following actions are Type I if they are directly undertaken, funded
or approved by an agency:
(1) The adoption of a municipality's land use plan or zoning regulations
or the adoption by any agency of a comprehensive resource
management plan.
(2) The following changes in the allowable uses within any zoning
district affecting 25 or more acres of the district.
(a) The authorization of industrial or commercial uses within a
residential or agricultural district.
(b) The authorization of residential uses within an agricultural
district.
(3) The granting of a zoning change at the request of an applicant for
an action that meets or exceeds one or more of the thresholds given
in other sections of this list.
(4) The acquisition, sale, lease or other transfer of 100 or more
contiguous acres of land by a state or local agency.
(5) The construction of new residential units which meet or exceed the
following thresholds:
(a) Ten units in municipalities which have not adopted zoning
regulations.
(b) Fifty units not to be connected (at commencement of
habitation) to community or publicly owned utilities.
(c) Two hundred fifty units to be connected (at commencement of
habitation) to community or publicly owned utilities in a city,
town or village having a population of less than 150,000.
§ 70-11 WARSAW CODE § 70-11
1:68
§ 70-12. Designation of Type II actions.
(6) The construction of new nonresidential facilities which meet or
exceed any of the following thresholds or the expansion of existing
nonresidential facilities by more than 50% of any of the following
thresholds, provided that the expansion and the existing facilities,
when combined, meet or exceed any threshold contained in this
section:
(a) A project or action which involves the physical alteration of 10
acres.
(b) A project or action which would use ground- or surface water
in excess of 2,000,000 gallons per day.
(c) Parking for 1,000 vehicles.
(d) A facility with more than 100,000 square feet of gross floor
area in a city, town or village having a population of 150,000
persons or less.
(7) Any structure exceeding 100 feet above original ground level in a
locality without any zoning regulation pertaining to height.
(8) Any nonagricultural use occurring wholly or partially within an
agricultural district (certified pursuant to the Agriculture and
Markets Law, Article 25AA, § 303) which exceeds 10% of any
threshold established in this section.
(9) Any action, unless the action is designed for the preservation of the
facility or site, occurring wholly or partially within or contiguous to
any facility or site listed in the National Register of Historic Places
or any historic building, structure or site or prehistoric site that has
been proposed by the Committee on the Registers for consideration
by the New York State Board on Historic Preservation for a
recommendation to the State Historic Officer for nomination for
inclusion in said National Register.
(10) Any project or action which exceeds 25% of any threshold in this
section, occurring wholly or partially within or substantially
contiguous to any publicly owned or operated parkland, recreation
area or designated open space.
(11) Any action which exceeds the locally established thresholds or, if
no such thresholds are established, any action which takes place
wholly or partially within or substantially contiguous to any critical
environmental area designated by a local agency pursuant to
Section 617.4.
A. The actions listed in this section are deemed Type II actions in addition
to those set forth in Section 617.13.
§ 70-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 70-12
1:69
B. Actions or classes of actions which have been determined not to have a
significant effect on the environment are classified as Type II actions
and do not require environmental impact statements or any other
determination or procedure under this section.
C. Each agency may adopt its own Type II list, provided that it finds that
each of the actions contained on it is no less protective of the
environment than the list in this section and will in no case have a
significant effect on the environment based on the criteria contained in
Section 617.11 and any additional criteria contained in its procedures
adopted pursuant to Section 617.4. An agency may not designate as
Type I any action on the Type II list.
D. The following actions are Type II actions:
(1) The replacement of a facility, in kind, on the same site, unless such
facility meets any of the thresholds in Section 617.12.
(2) The granting of individual setback and lot line variances.
(3) Agricultural farm management practices, including construction,
maintenance and repair of farm buildings and structures and land
use changes consistent with generally accepted principles of
farming.
(4) The repaving of existing highways not involving the addition of new
travel lanes.
(5) Street openings for the purpose of repair or maintenance of
existing utility facilities.
(6) Installations of traffic control devices on existing streets, roads and
highways.
(7) Public or private forest management practices, other than the
removal of trees or the application of herbicides or pesticides.
(8) The construction or placement of minor structures accessory or
appurtenant to existing facilities, including garages, carports,
patios, home swimming pools, fences, barns or other buildings not
changing land use or density.
(9) The maintenance of existing landscaping or natural growth.
(10) The mapping of existing roads, streets, highways, uses and

C. Applications for building permits. Applications for a building permit
shall be made in writing on a form provided by or otherwise acceptable
to the Code Enforcement Officer. The application shall be signed by the

accepted construction documents shall be returned to the applicant
to be kept at the work site so as to be available for use by the code
enforcement personnel. However, the return of a set of accepted

permit holder shall immediately notify the Code Enforcement Officer of
any change occurring during the course of the work. The building
permit shall contain such a directive. If the Code Enforcement Officer
determines that such change warrants a new or amended building
permit, such change shall not be made until and unless a new or
amended building permit reflecting such change is issued.
H. Time limits. Building permits shall become invalid unless the authorized
work is commenced within six months following the date of issuance.

permit or suspend the building permit until such time as the permit
holder demonstrates that:

which a building permit is required, and without regard to whether
a building permit has or has not been issued for such work; or
(2) Any work that is being conducted in a dangerous or unsafe manner
in the opinion of the Code Enforcement Officer, without regard to

order shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for or limitation of,
the right and authority to pursue any other remedy or impose any other
penalty under § 78-15 (Violations) of this chapter or under any other
applicable local law or state law. Any such other remedy or penalty may

building or structure is proceeding without a building permit or is
otherwise in violation of provisions of any applicable laws, codes,
ordinances, rules or regulations, or not in conformity with the
provisions of an application, plans or specifications on the basis of
which a building permit was issued, or in an unsafe or dangerous
manner, he may notify the owner of the property or the owner's agent,
or the person performing the work, to suspend all work, and any such
persons must forthwith stop such work and suspend all building
activities until the stop-work order has been rescinded. Such order and
notice must be in writing, must state the conditions under which the
work may be resumed and may be served upon a person to whom it is

for which a building permit was previously issued shall be granted only

GARAGE SALES AND YARD SALES
§ 88-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the Garage Sales and Yard
Sales Law of the Village of Warsaw."
§ 88-2. Legislative intent and purpose.
The legislative intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish conditions
pursuant to which residents may conduct occasional garage sales and/or
yard sales at their premises within the Village of Warsaw. It has come to
the attention of the Village Board that a number of residents are having
frequent and/or repeated garage and yard sales at their homes, in effect
turning their residential premises into a site where retail business is
conducted in a residential area. The Village Board has determined that,
in order to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of the
residents in the Village of Warsaw, it has become necessary to restrict such
garage sales and yard sales in residential zoning districts. Such sales, if
continued without limitation, tend to have the affect of establishing retail
businesses in residential areas, creating public nuisance, and altering and
compromising the residential character of the neighborhoods and otherwise
violating the spirit and intent of the Village Code.

JUNKYARDS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Garbage and refuse  See Ch. 90.
Abandoned vehicles  See Ch. 149.
Zoning  See Ch. 163.
§ 96-1. Purposes.
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate, control and license those
activities or businesses known as "automobile graveyards," junkyards,
secondhand parts collection areas, the processing of used metals for resale
and the dumping, storage and disposal of waste or used materials of
whatever composition. Without regulation and control, such activities and
businesses can constitute a hazard to persons and property and can create
a public nuisance. Stored materials may be highly flammable or even
explosive. Gasoline tanks on automobiles often contain gasoline in some
quantity and engines and other parts of stored automobiles are frequently
covered with grease and oil. Tires, plastic seats, tops and other parts of
automobiles are also flammable. Batteries and other parts of automobiles
can contain acids and other material potentially harmful to humans.
Vehicles frequently contain sharp metal or glass edges or points from
which people could receive serious cuts and abrasions, and can constitute
attractive nuisances to children and adults. Even in commercial or
industrial areas, the presence of such junkyards is unsightly and tends to
detract from the value of the surrounding land and property unless such
areas are properly maintained and operated.
§ 96-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following definitions shall have the meanings
indicated:
JUNK  Old or scrap copper, brass, rope, rags, batteries, paper, trash,
rubber debris, waste or junked, scrapped, ruined, dismantled or wrecked
motor vehicles or parts thereof, iron, steel and other old or scrap ferrous or
nonferrous material, tires, lumber, pallets and other wood debris.
JUNKYARD  Outside storage or deposit, whether in connection with
another business or not, where two or more unregistered, old or
secondhand motor vehicles, no longer intended or in condition for legal use
on the public highways, are held, whether for the purpose of resale or sale
of used parts therefrom or the purpose of reclaiming for use some or all
§ 90-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 96-2
1:107
of the materials therein, whether metal, glass, fabric or otherwise or for
the purpose of disposing of the same or for any other purpose. Such term
shall include any place of storage or deposit for any such purposes of used
parts or waste materials from motor vehicles and/or material defined as
junk which, taken together, equal in volume 100 cubic feet; also any land
or structure used for collection, storage, sale or disposal of junk, scrap
metal or other discarded materials. Excluded from this definition are motor
vehicles maintained and used on a seasonal basis (i.e., motorcycles and
winter or summer cars).
MOTOR VEHICLE  Passenger automobile, truck, tractor-truck trailer,
bus, motorcycle or other vehicle, however propelled, as well as tractors,
bulldozers, machinery and equipment.

or junk or any waste material, whether composed of wood, paper, cloth,
cardboard, plastics, metals, stone, cement or otherwise, without first
obtaining a license therefor as hereinafter provided.

detailed in Chapter 163, Zoning, of the Village of Warsaw Code, after
which the license may be granted by the Village Board.
A. The Village Board may, by resolution, determine the fee for the license,
which sum will include not only the cost of issuance of the license itself,
but also the cost of making the necessary inspections of the premises to
ascertain compliance as hereinafter prescribed.
§ 96-2 WARSAW CODE § 96-6

shall be erected not nearer than 50 feet from a public highway.
However, where the topography or natural growth of timber or other
considerations accomplish the purpose of this chapter in whole or in
part, the fencing requirements hereunder may be reduced by the
Village Board, provided that such natural barrier conforms to the
purpose of this section.
C. All motor vehicles, parts or other materials stored or deposited by the
licensee and all wrecking or other work on such motor vehicles or
material stored must be kept within the enclosure of the junkyard,
except as removal may be necessary for the transportation of the same
in the reasonable course of business.
D. The burning of autos, parts and materials is strictly prohibited, unless
with the express written permission of the Chief of the Warsaw Fire

its inhabitants.
(b) Interferes with the comfortable enjoyment of life, property and

to the furtherance of the health and welfare of the village's
inhabitants and to the conduct of the normal pursuits of life,
recreations, commerce and industrial activity.
B. The Board of Trustees recognizes that many inhabitants of the Village
of Warsaw must sleep during the daylight hours in order that they may
be employed in the nighttime and that infants, invalids and illness
require that unnecessary noise be eliminated; and the Board of

the public interest that unnecessary noise, especially unnecessary
recreational noise, be eliminated within the corporate limits.

out of doors at loud levels should operate them with headsets or
headphones attached so that the persons who desire to listen to these
devices may enjoy them in comfort and that they not be permitted to
create a nuisance in the neighborhood. It is also an expression of the
legislative intent of this Board of Trustees that commercial
establishments which provide live entertainment or jukebox

No unauthorized person may uncover, connect to, use, alter or disturb
any public sewer or appurtenance thereof without first obtaining a written
permit from the Superintendent.
§ 123-8. Installer to be agent of owner; registration required.
The registered installer employed by the owner of the premises is the agent
of said owner while installing a sewer line from the premises and is not
the agent of the village. The village is not responsible for the acts of said
installer. Any installer employed to work on sewer lines must be registered
by the village to perform installation work.
§ 123-9. Cost of replacement lines and taps.
If a new sewer line is to replace an existing sewer line and a new tap is to be
installed in a public sewer, all necessary material must be paid for by owner.
§ 123-10. Permit fees; application.
§ 123-11. Costs to be borne by owner.
All costs and expenses of the installation, connection, operation and

A separate and independent building sewer must be provided for every
building, except where one building stands at the rear of another or on an
interior lot and no private building sewer is available or can be constructed
to the rear of the building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway.
Then, the building sewer from the front building may be extended to the
rear building and the whole considered as one building sewer, but the
village is not responsible for damage caused by or resulting from any such
single connection.
§ 123-13. Use of old building sewers.
Old building sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only
when they are found by the Superintendent to meet all requirements of this

§ 123-14. Construction rules and regulations.
A. The size, slope, alignment and materials of construction of a building
sewer and the methods to be used in excavation must conform to the
requirements of the Building and Plumbing Code or other applicable
rules and regulations of the village. In the absence of code provisions or
in amplification thereof, the materials and procedures are subject to the
approval of the Superintendent, but in no event may the internal
diameter of the building sewer be less than four inches. The slope of
such four-inch pipe may not be less than 1/4 inch per foot except where
unusual circumstances establish a proven hardship in the opinion of the
Superintendent. All building sewers must be installed to uniform grade
and in straight alignment insofar as possible, and changes in direction
may be made only with properly curved pipe fittings. The depth of the
sewer must be sufficient to afford protection from frost. Building
sewers must be service weight cast-iron soil pipe, or D-3034-72 ring
title joint PVC plastic, and must be surrounded by sand or select earth
compacted to at least one foot above the pipe. If PVC plastic pipe is
used it must be sleeved through the wall of any building. All such
connections must be watertight.
B. Road crossings. All road crossings must be bored in accordance with
New York State Department of Transportation specifications.
C. No footing drains, roof drains or other drains carrying surface or
ground water may be connected to the building or sanitary sewer. A
sump pump will be provided wherever required to carry ground- and
surface water to a natural outlet or storm sewer.
D. Where any work is performed in a street or highway right-of-way, the
owner must first obtain a permit from the proper state, county, village
or town highway authority. Notice or request for inspection or final
approval by highway authorities will be the responsibility of the owner.
Utility companies are to be notified if work may affect their facilities.
§ 123-12 WARSAW CODE § 123-14
1:140
E. All building sewers must be air-tested for leakage after installation. The
test must be conducted on all joints that would be exposed to infiltration
of groundwater, surface water or other extraneous sources of
unpolluted waters. The tests to the building plumbing system must be
conducted from a point as close to the connection to the public sewer as
possible and must be completed prior to backfilling the building sewer.
Testing may also be completed after backfilling if deemed necessary by
the Superintendent. The tests must be conducted by the contractor.
F. No backfill may be placed until the work has been inspected by the
Superintendent. In the event of unstable soil conditions, special
construction methods may be required but must be approved by the
Superintendent, who must be notified upon completion of the work for
final inspection.
G. Each building sewer must be provided with a cleanout at the house wall
end; at bends greater than 45°; at a road crossing; and at least at every
100 feet of length. The openings must be a minimum of three inches
above the cellar floor or ground surface outside the building. Single
hand traps shall be installed outside buildings. Double hand traps are
required when the trap is in the wall or inside the building. No trap or
vent may be placed less than five feet from any window, door or
ventilation intake unless approved by the Superintendent.
H. Each installation must have suitable traps.
I. Connection of the building sewer into the public sanitary sewer must
be:
(1) Plastic, reinforced concrete, cast iron, ductile iron or ABS truss
cement Y-branch and/or riser installed at the time of construction of
the sanitary sewer. All Y-branches or risers must comply with
appropriate pipe specifications referenced elsewhere in this
chapter. Joints must be compatible with the above-referenced
specifications for the type of pipe used and must be approved by
the Superintendent. All damaged branches must be replaced. All
connections must be watertight. Concrete encasement of branches
and mortar joints may not be deemed watertight. Risers must be
braced against trench walls or supported otherwise.
(2) Saddle-type connections to the sanitary sewer (main sewer) may
only be used with the approval of the Superintendent. The village
will furnish the connection material. All other material and
equipment must be supplied by the property owner. These
connections must be made in a smooth, machine-drilled, round
hole. The fitting must be made so it does not protrude into the main
sewer. The fitting must match the contour of the inside of the main
sewer and be designed for the size of pipe into which it is installed.
J. All excavations for building or sanitary sewer installations must be
adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the
public from hazard. No roadway may be left open overnight without
§ 123-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 123-14
1:141
authorization from the Superintendent. Unless authorized by the
Superintendent, one-lane traffic must be maintained.
K. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other public property disturbed in the
course of the work must be restored in a manner satisfactory to the
Superintendent. Sidewalks must be restored only with concrete.
Ditches and culvert pipes for storm- and surface water or other utilities
disturbed during installation must be replaced. All driveways and
parking areas must be backfilled with select fill.
L. Upon connection to the public sewer, any septic tank, cesspool and
similar private wastewater disposal facility must be cleaned of sludge
and filled with material approved by the Superintendent.
M. If any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public
sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain must be lifted by
an approved means and discharged to the building sewer.

ARTICLE IV
Use of Public Sewers
§ 123-15. Discharge of certain waters prohibited.
No person may discharge any stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage, uncontaminated cooling water or unpolluted
industrial process water to any sanitary sewer.
§ 123-16. Stormwater and other unpolluted drainage water.
Stormwater and all other unpolluted drainage must be discharged to such
sewers as are specifically designated as storm sewers or to a natural outlet.
With approval of the Superintendent and DEC, industrial cooling water or
unpolluted industrial process waters may be discharged to a storm sewer or
natural outlet.
§ 123-17. Prohibitions on wastewater discharges.
No person may discharge or deposit into the wastewater treatment system
any wastewater which contains the following:
A. Explosive mixtures. Liquids, solids or gases which may, either alone or
by interaction with other substances, cause fire or explosion or be
injurious in any way to the wastewater treatment system or to the
operation of the system. At no time may two successive readings on an

treatment works influent exceeds 104° F. [40° C.].
G. Improperly shredded garbage. Garbage that has not been ground or
commuted to such a degree that all particles will be carried freely in
suspension under flow conditions normally prevailing in the public
sewers, with no particle greater than 1/2 inch in any dimension.
H. Noxious materials. Noxious or malodorous solids, liquids or gases
which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are capable of
creating a public nuisance or hazard or may be sufficient to prevent
entry into a sewer for its maintenance and repair.
I. Radioactive wastes. Radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or
concentration that they do not comply with regulations or orders issued
by the appropriate authority having control over their use and/or which
may cause damage to the wastewater treatment system or danger to
personnel operating the system.
J. Excessive discharge rate. Quantities of wastewater flow or
concentrations, or both, which constitute a slug as defined herein.
K. Discolored material. Wastes with color, such as but not limited to dye
water or vegetable tanning solution, that are not removable by the
treatment process.
L. Any substance which may cause the wastewater treatment system
effluent or any other product of the wastewater treatment system, such
as residues, sludge or scums, to be unsuitable for a reclamation process
where the wastewater treatment system is pursuing a reuse and
reclamation program. No substance discharged into the wastewater
treatment system may cause the system to be in noncompliance with
sludge use or disposal criteria, guidelines or regulations affecting
sludge use or development pursuant to the Solid Waste Disposal Act,
the Clean Air Act, the Toxic Substance Control Act or state criteria
applicable to the sludge management method being used.
A. General limitations on incompatible pollutants. No person may
discharge or convey or permit or allow to be discharged or conveyed to
a public sanitary sewer any wastewater containing incompatible
pollutants of such character or quantity that will:
§ 123-17 WARSAW CODE § 123-18
1:144
(1) Violate pretreatment standards.
(2) Cause the wastewater treatment works to violate its SPDES permit
requirements.
(3) Violate the provisions of this chapter or other applicable laws, rules
or regulations.
(4) Not be susceptible to treatment or interfere with the process or
efficiency of the treatment system.
B. Specific limitations on certain compatible pollutants. The following are
the maximum concentrations of pollutants allowable in wastewater
discharges to the wastewater treatment system as established by the
DEC. This chapter includes by reference any future revisions or
additions to this list as promulgated by the DEC or the EPA. Dilution of
any wastewater discharge for the purpose of satisfying these
requirements is a violation of this chapter.

C. Limitations on compatible pollutants. In cases where the effluent
characteristics of an industrial or commercial discharge exceed the
permissible limits for the compatible pollutants listed below, the
acceptability of such waste will be left to the engineering judgment of
the village or any other federal, state or local agencies having
jurisdiction. The primary judgment criteria for the determination of
acceptability by the village and responsible authorities will be whether
the admission of such waste will overload the wastewater treatment
system. If it is determined that it will not overload the system,
permission to discharge said compatible pollutants may be granted.
However, the village will require (in accordance with Article IX and any
resolutions adopted thereunder) the payment of an additional industrial
operation and maintenance surcharge for the additional cost and a user
charge for the additional capital construction costs to cover the cost of
treating the excessive strength wastewater. This charge is in addition to
any sewer charges for the nonexcessive waste discharge. "Excessive
strength wastewater" is defined as:
(1) Concentrations of inert suspended solids which exceed 250
milligrams per liter, such as but not limited to Fuller's earth, lime
slurries and lime residues or dissolved solids, such as but not
limited to sodium chloride in concentrations greater than 10,000
milligrams per liter and sodium sulfate in concentrations greater
than 500 milligrams per liter.
(2) Concentrations of BOD which exceed 200 milligrams per liter.
(3) Chlorine demand requirements exceeding nine milligrams per liter.
(4) Concentrations of free ammonia which exceed 25 milligrams per
liter.

§ 123-19. Regulatory actions.
If wastewater containing any prohibited substance or any concentration in
excess of those allowed by this chapter is discharged or proposed to be
discharged into the wastewater treatment system or to any system tributary
thereto, the Superintendent must enforce the provisions of this chapter in
accordance with Article X and must take any action necessary to:
§ 123-20. Submission of plans; approval; alterations.
Where pretreatment, equalization or holding (storage for scheduled
discharge) of wastewater flows prior to discharge into any part of the
wastewater treatment system is required, construction plans and other
pertinent information relating to such pretreatment or flow control facilities
must first be submitted to the Superintendent for approval. Such approval
may not exempt the discharge of such facilities from compliance with the
Act (in particular, Section 307) and any other applicable code, ordinance,
rule, regulation or order of any governmental authority. Any subsequent
alterations or additions to such pretreatment or flow control facilities must
not be made without notice to and approval of the Superintendent.
§ 123-21. Pretreatment facilities operations.
If pretreatment or control of wastewater flow is required, such facilities
must be maintained in good working order and operated as efficiently as
possible by the owner and/or operator at his own cost and expense, subject
to the requirements of these rules and regulations and all other applicable
codes, ordinances and laws.
A. Prohibit the discharge of such wastewater.
B. Require a discharger to demonstrate that in-plant modifications will
reduce or eliminate the discharge of such substances in conformity with
this chapter.
C. Require pretreatment, including storage facilities, or flow equalization
necessary to reduce or eliminate the objectionable characteristics or
substances so that the discharge will conform to the pretreatment
standards and will not violate this chapter.
D. Require the person making, causing or allowing the discharge to pay
any additional cost, expenses or damages incurred by the village due to
the prohibited or limited discharge.
E. Take such other remedial actions as may be deemed to be desirable to
achieve the purpose of this chapter.

§ 123-22. Grease, oil and sand interceptors.
Grease, oil and sand interceptors must be provided by the owner when,
in the opinion of the Superintendent, they are necessary for the proper
handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients, except that such
interceptors may not be required for private living quarters or dwelling
units. All interceptors must be of a type and capacity approved by the
Superintendent and must be so located as to be readily accessible for
cleaning and inspection.
§ 123-23. Control manhole.
When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced
by a building sewer carrying industrial waste must install a suitable control
manhole, together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in
the building sewer, to facilitate observations, sampling, measurement and
recording of the discharged wastewater. Such manhole must be accessible
and safely located and must be constructed in accordance with plans
approved by the Superintendent. The manhole must be installed by the
owner at his expense and must be maintained by him so as to be safe and
accessible at all times.
§ 123-24. Protection from accidental discharge.
Each industrial user must provide protection from accidental discharge of
prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter. Facilities
to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited materials must be provided
and maintained at the owner's or operator's own cost and expense. Detailed
plans showing facilities and operating procedures to provide this protection
must be approved by the Superintendent before construction of the facility.
Approval of such plans and operating procedures will not relieve the
industrial user from the responsibility of modifying the facility as necessary
to meet the requirements of this chapter.
§ 123-25. Reporting of accidental discharge.
If a facility does not comply with or will be unable to comply with any
prohibition or limitation in this chapter, the facility must immediately notify
the Superintendent so that corrective action may be taken to protect the
wastewater treatment system. In addition, a written report addressed to
the village detailing the date, time and cause of accidental discharge, the
quantity and characteristics of the discharge and corrective action taken to
prevent future discharges must be filed by the facility within five days of the
occurrence of the noncomplying discharge.
§ 123-26. Improper use of sewers; inspections.
The Superintendent may inspect and/or test any building sewer and
building drain and appurtenances or private sewer that discharges
wastewater to the village's wastewater treatment system. In the case of
§ 123-22 WARSAW CODE § 123-26
1:148
basement inspection, the Superintendent must give prior notice of no less
than 12 hours nor more than 48 hours if requested by the owner. If such
sewers or drains are used or maintained in such a way as to cause discharge
of any wastewater that violates this chapter, groundwater, debris which
exceeds the design criteria of said sewer or any other waste deemed
objectionable by the Superintendent, the Superintendent will initiate
enforcement action under Article X.
§ 123-27. Costs to be borne by user.
All costs incurred in reviewing and implementing the control actions
specified in this Article shall be the responsibility of the actual or proposed
user.

demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter and any
applicable state or federal pretreatment standards or requirements.
B. Such records shall be made available upon request by the
Superintendent. All such records relating to compliance with
pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of the DEC
or the EPA. A summary of such data indicating the industrial user's
compliance with this chapter must be prepared at intervals as
requested by the Superintendent and submitted to the village.
C. The owner or operator of any premises or facility discharging industrial
wastes into the system must, when required by the Superintendent,
install, at his own cost and expense, suitable monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of
wastes. Such equipment must be maintained in proper working order
and kept safe and accessible at all times. The sampling, analysis and
flow measurement procedures, equipment and results are subject at
any time to inspection by the village.
D. The monitoring equipment must be located and maintained on the
industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the
Superintendent may allow such facility to be constructed in the public
street or sidewalk area, with the approval of the public agency having
jurisdiction over such street or sidewalk, and located so that it will not
be an obstruction to public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
E. Whether on public or private property, the monitoring facilities must be
constructed in accordance with the requirements of the Superintendent
and all applicable standards and specifications as required in this
chapter.
A. Compliance determination. Compliance determinations under Article IV
may be made on the basis of either instantaneous grab samples or
composite samples of wastewater, as determined necessary by the
Superintendent. Composite samples may be taken over a twenty-fourhour
period or over a longer or shorter time span as required to meet
the needs of specific circumstances.
B. Analyses of industrial wastewaters. Laboratory analyses of industrial
wastewater samples must be performed in accordance with the current
edition of Standard Methods, Methods for Chemical Analysis of Water
and Waste, published by the EPA, or the Annual Book of Standards, Part
23, Water, Atmospheric Analysis, published by ASTM. Analyses of
pollutants not covered by these publications must be performed in

§ 123-32. Special agreements.
Special agreements and arrangements between the Superintendent and
any persons or agencies may be established when, in the opinion of the
Superintendent, unusual or extraordinary circumstances compel special
terms and conditions.
C. Sampling frequency. Sampling of industrial wastewater for the purpose
of compliance determination with respect to Article IV must be done at
such intervals as the Superintendent requires.
A. All information and data obtained from reports, questionnaires and
monitoring programs and from inspections must be available to the
public or other governmental agency without restriction, unless the
user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction
of the Superintendent that the release of such information would
divulge information, processes or methods which would be detrimental
to the user's competitive position.
B. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes must not
be made available for inspection by the public, but must be made
available to governmental agencies for use in making studies; provided,
however, that such portions of a report will be available for use by the
state or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents
and characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.

sets of detailed construction plans showing the proposed construction must
be submitted to the village for preliminary review. Following preliminary
review and approval, the applicant must submit three sets of applications
to construct a sanitary sewer, along with eight sets of detailed construction

with a letter of approval to the DEC. Evidence of DEC approval, as well as
other required local, state and/or federal approvals, is required prior to final
acceptance.
§ 123-37. Inspection during construction.
Inspection during construction will be made by the Superintendent. No
sanitary sewers are to be covered until such inspection has been made. The
Superintendent will send a letter to the applicant certifying that inspection,
testing and acceptance have been completed. Acceptance by the
Superintendent does not relieve the owner of the responsibility to keep the
sewer operating in accordance with these regulations. A complete set of
plans showing the final construction, Y or T locations and other information
must be submitted prior to final acceptance. The cost of the inspection and
review will be the responsibility of the extension applicant.

Extensions or additions to the sanitary sewer system must be designed
and constructed in accordance with the latest revisions of the New York
State Standards for Waste Treatment Works, the Water Pollution Control
Federation Manual of Practice No. 9 Design and Construction of Sanitary
and Storm Sewers, the Wyoming County Health Department Regulations
and ASTM Specifications for Sanitary Sewer Construction.
§ 123-39. Sanitary sewer connection to public sanitary sewers.
A. Connection of sanitary sewer extensions to the public sanitary sewer is
prohibited until completion of the procedures outlined in this Article.
B. Existing private or sanitary sewers may be connected to the public
sanitary sewer only when they are found by the Superintendent to meet
all standards set by this chapter. Any testing costs will be the
responsibility of the sewer extension applicant.
§ 123-36 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 123-40
1:157
§ 123-40. Bond.
Any person installing a sanitary sewer extension must post a maintenance
bond with the village (to be approved by the Superintendent) for 25% of the
full value of the sewer construction cost guaranteeing the sewer for a period
of two years from the time of acceptance by the Superintendent. During this
period, any defects in the sewer or appurtenances must be corrected at the
applicant's expense.
§ 123-41. Excavations.
§ 123-42. Extensions beyond existing village boundaries.
Extensions of the sanitary sewer system outside of the village boundaries
must comply with this chapter, as well as all appropriate village, state
and federal laws, ordinances, rules and regulations and other rules and
regulations the village may adopt.
A. Whenever pipe installation is not in progress, the end of the pipe shall
be securely closed with a tight-fitting cover or plugs. Any earth or other
material entering the main sewer due to operations of the installer or
building owner must be removed at his expense. All trenches must be
protected by sufficient sheeting and bracing.

ARTICLE IX
Sewer Charges
§ 123-43. Establishment; purpose.
There is hereby established for all users of the village wastewater treatment
system a system of sewer charges which will be used for payment of the
cost of management, maintenance, operation, repair and amortization of the
capital construction costs of the wastewater treatment system.
§ 123-44. Sewer rates.
A. The village, by resolution, will establish rates and charges for sewer
services and equipment. Rates and charges may differ for use outside
the village limits. The rates and charges may be amended from time to
time by resolution of the village and may include, but are not limited to:
meter rates; minimum rates; flat rates; bulk rates; equipment; testing,
installations; late charges; discontinuance of service; maintenance;
repairs; and penalties as set forth elsewhere in this Article.
B. Sewer charges will be billed quarterly or at such other time as
determined by resolution of the village.
C. The user may not claim any credit towards a sewer bill unless granted
by resolution of the village.
D. All rates and charges are due and payable at the office of the Village
Clerk within 30 days of the date of the quarterly bill. If a quarterly bill is
not received, the user must inquire with the Village Clerk. The absence
of a bill does not excuse quarterly payment of sewer rates. If the bill is
not paid when due, a penalty of 10% will be added to the bill. If it is not
paid within 60 days, water and sewer service may be terminated until
the bill is paid in full. An additional service charge must be paid to
resume the water and sewer service. All charges for materials furnished
or work completed by the village in connection with the sewer service
will be billed as sewer charges.
E. All charges, rates, penalties, service charges and fines described in this
Article will become a lien upon the real property serviced until paid. If
said sums are not paid when demanded, water service may be
terminated and a reconnection charge imposed for resumption of
service. The Village Clerk will maintain records of nonpayment, and any
person may receive a certificate indicating the status of payment of
water and sewer bills affecting any particular premises serviced by the
village sewer systems. A conveyance of real property subject to an
unpaid sewer bill will result in the new user being responsible for all
amounts due. Nothing herein contained will prevent the village from
using any other means of collecting unpaid sewer charges. The village
may assess said amount against the property, together with the annual
village tax, and may collect it with the village tax in the same manner as
any other local assessment.
§ 123-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 123-45
1:159
§ 123-45. Charges to industrial cost recovery users.
Provisions of this Article covering user charges shall not pertain to
industrial recovery users, which shall be charged according to the terms of
their specific agreement with the village.

§ 123-46. Liability for loss or damage.

for any and all losses, damages and expenses incurred by the village or for
which the village may be held liable as a result of said violation.

§ 123-48. Penalties for offenses.
Any person found in violation of Article IV, § 123-17 or 123-18, of this

above is guilty of an offense and, upon conviction, is subject to a fine of
not more than $250 or to imprisonment for a period of not more than 15
days, or both. Each day in which any violation of Article IV, § 123-17 or
123-18, continues is a separate offense. The failure to satisfactorily correct
or discontinue any violation contained in each notice served, whether for
the same or a different violation, is a separate offense.
§ 123-49. Other remedies.
Nothing contained herein prevents the village or Superintendent, either
alone or in conjunction with the foregoing penalties, from maintaining an
action or proceeding in the name of the village or Superintendent in any
court of competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or to restrain
by injunction the violation of any provision of this chapter. In addition, the
village or Superintendent reserves the right to obtain reimbursement for
any loss, damage or expense incurred by it as a result of any violation of this
chapter.
A. Any person violating any provision of this chapter will be served by the
Superintendent with a written notice stating the nature of the violation
and providing a time limit of seven days for the satisfactory correction
thereof.
B. Service of the notice of violation is sufficient if directed to the owner or
operator of a residence, commercial or industrial facility violating this
chapter. Service of said notice of violation must be made personally
upon the alleged violator, if possible; otherwise, said notice of violation
is sufficient if served by delivering the same to a person of suitable age
or discretion at the actual residence, commercial or industrial facility at
which said violation is occurring and by mailing the notice to the person
to be served at his last known residence or business address; or, where
service cannot otherwise be made with due diligence, by affixing said
notice of violation to the door of the residence, commercial or industrial
facility at which said violation is occurring and by mailing said notice to
such person at his last known residence or place of business.

pavement cuts or trenches are to be left unfilled overnight except
in emergencies and with the approval of the Superintendent of
Public Works. In such cases adequate precautions must be
exercised to protect traffic. When working on any sidewalk or
street, contractors must complete final backfilling of any open
trench within 14 days from the time of its opening.

1:176
(2) All pipes or mains crossing street pavement must, whenever
possible, be driven beneath the roadway without disturbance from
the edge of the pavement. Such crossover pipes must, whenever
possible, be enclosed in sleeves or larger pipes so that repairs or
replacements may be made in the future without disturbance of
highway pavement.
(3) In the event that a trench is opened, the trench must be compacted
to within four inches of the road surface after completion of the
necessary work and construction. The existing asphalt surface
must then be cut back at least 12 inches on either side of the
undisturbed grade.
(4) At the discretion of the Superintendent of Public Works, the contact
surfaces, the packed surfaces and/or adjacent pavement edges
must be painted and sealed with approved bituminous and/or
bluestone material before or after placing the course of asphalt,
which must be four inches of New York Specification 6-8 hot plant
mix. This course must be rolled with an eight-to-ten ton roller, and
surface variations in excess of 1/4 inch must be eliminated or the

compaction, as outlined above, must apply with the addition of a
covering of sod or grass seeding as specified by the Superintendent
of Public Works.
C. A free flow of traffic is to be maintained at all times during the progress
of the work. Adequate signs, barricades and lights necessary to protect
the public must be provided. Flagmen must be employed continuously
during periods when only one-way traffic can be maintained or when
equipment is operated back and forth across the pavement area. No
construction equipment or materials must be left on the pavement after
working hours, nor may any construction equipment or materials be
placed in such manner or location that will obstruct the highway or
railroad warning signs. Barricades, whether in sidewalk or roadway
areas, must have prominently displayed the address and telephone
number of someone available 24 hours a day who must reestablish the

ARTICLE VIII
Sidewalk Construction
§ 129-35. Responsibility of owner to construct or replace sidewalk.
All new sidewalks constructed within the Village of Warsaw must be
constructed by the owner of the adjoining property at the expense of said
owner. The replacement of an existing sidewalk is considered new sidewalk
construction to which the terms of this Article apply. This Article does not
apply to walkways or pass-through walks which do not run along highways
but which lead from one highway to another.
§ 129-36. Option to share a portion of the expense of sidewalk
construction.
The Village Board may annually, by resolution, compensate a homeowner
for a portion of the expense of reconstruction of sidewalks. At the time of
the resolution, the Village Board must fix the proportionate amount to be
paid by the village. The proportionate amount must apply to all sidewalks of
the same kind which may be constructed within the time designated by the
resolution and may not exceed 1/2 of the actual and necessary expense of
the construction of the sidewalk.
§ 129-37. Permit required; application; issuance and duration of
permit.
No sidewalk may be constructed or work commenced until the owner of
said premises has obtained a permit. Applications must be submitted to the
Village Clerk in such form as required by the Village Board. The permit will
be issued by the Superintendent of Public Works and will be valid for 60
days from the date of the final approval.
§ 129-38. Specifications.
Unless the sidewalk in the immediate area is flagstone or bituminous
concrete, and then only if the specifications approved by the
Superintendent of Public Works for such materials are followed, new
sidewalks must be constructed according to the following specifications:
A. All sidewalks must be at least four feet in width, except that repairs or
replacements may conform to the width of the existing sidewalk.
B. All sidewalks must be at least four inches thick, except that where such
sidewalks are crossed by driveways, said sidewalks must be at least six
inches thick through the width of the driveway.
C. The individual blocks of the sidewalk must be no more than four feet in
length. There must be at least one one-fourth-inch expansion joint
between every other block of the sidewalk. In the alternative, sidewalks
may have traverse construction joints of one-half-inch premolded
bituminous material to the full depth of the concrete, spaced 20 feet
§ 129-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 129-38
1:179
§ 129-39. Notice of work to be done; inspection.
The Superintendent of Public Works must be notified no less than 24 hours
in advance of the construction of new sidewalks or the reconstruction of
existing sidewalks. The Superintendent of Public Works must be given the
opportunity to inspect the work both during its progress and upon its
completion to verify that such work conforms to specifications contained in
this chapter.
§ 129-40. Assessment of cost of construction done by village.
The Village Board may, by resolution, require owners of property adjoining
village streets to construct sidewalks. If the owner does not construct the
sidewalk as required by this notice, the Village Board may cause the same
apart and the top surface must be scored at intervals of three to
five feet so that the finished walk will be marked in squares both
longitudinally and transversely.
D. Joints and edges must be finished with an edging tool of 1/4 inch radius.
Premolded bituminous joint filler must be placed between the sidewalk
and the curb, pavement or buildings.
E. Sidewalks must have a mixture of not less than one part cement to two
parts clean sand and four parts clean gravel or broken stone. Said
coarse aggregate must be both No. 1 and No. 2 crushed stone, New
York State approved. The proportions must be such that there is a
minimum of 3,500 pounds per square inch.
F. All sidewalks must be struck off to grade and finished with a wooden
float, leaving a smooth but nonslippery surface. After the sidewalk is
finished and the surface is hard, it must be covered for at least two days
to keep moisture in the sidewalk.
G. The grade and location of the sidewalk will be determined by the
Superintendent of Public Works.
H. The water used during the construction must be free from oil, alkali,
acid or vegetable matter.
I. Ingredients of concrete must be separately measured loose, in
approved receptacles. The mixing of concrete must be done in a manner
satisfactory to the Superintendent and subject at all stages to his
approval. Batch making only will be approved, and hand-mixing will be
permitted only in case of necessity. A minimum of water, accurately
measured, must give the necessary plasticity. After the materials are
first wetted, the work must proceed without delay until the whole batch
is in place. The mass in place will be carefully and thoroughly worked to
expel air, fill voids and secure perfect and continuous contact with
forms.
J. The mixtures herein set forth are minimum requirements.
§ 129-38 WARSAW CODE § 129-40
1:180
to be constructed and assess the cost to such adjoining landowner. All work
by the owners must be done in accordance with the specifications made
for sidewalk construction. All assessments will be made and collected, and
taxes levied, as provided by law.

ARTICLE X
Prior Notice of Defects
§ 129-44. Notice of defects and snow and ice in streets and other
property required.
No civil action may be maintained against the Village of Warsaw or the
Superintendent of Public Works or against any improvement district in the
village for damages or injuries to persons or property (including those
from the operation of snowmobiles) sustained by reason of any highway,
bridge, culvert, highway marking, sign or device or any other property
owned, operated or maintained by the village, or any property owned,
operated or maintained by an improvement district therein, being defective,
out of repair, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed unless written notice of
such defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed condition of such highway,
bridge culvert, highway marking, sign or device or any other property
owned, operated or maintained by the village, or any property owned,
operated or maintained by any improvement district, was actually given
to the Village Clerk or the Superintendent of Public Works and there was
a failure or neglect within a reasonable time after giving of such notice
to repair or remove the defect, danger or obstruction complained of; and
no such action may be maintained for damages or injuries to person or
property sustained solely in consequence of the existence of snow or ice
upon any highway, bridge, culvert or any other property owned by any
improvement district in the village unless written notice thereof, specifying
the particular place, was actually given to the Village Clerk or the
Superintendent of Public Works and there was a failure or neglect to cause
such snow or ice to be removed or to make the place otherwise reasonably
safe within a reasonable time after the receipt of such notice.
§ 129-45. Notice of defects and snow and ice in sidewalks required.
No civil action may be maintained against the village and/or the Village
Superintendent of Public Works for damages or injuries to persons or
property sustained by reason of any defect in the sidewalks of the village
or in consequence of the existence of snow or ice upon any of its sidewalks
unless such sidewalks have been constructed or are maintained by the
village or the Superintendent of Public Works of the village pursuant to
statute, nor may any action be maintained by reason of such defect or in
consequence of such existence of snow or ice unless written notice thereof,
specifying the particular place, was actually given to the Village Clerk or the
Superintendent of Public Works and there was a failure or neglect to cause
such defect to be remedied, such snow or ice to be removed or to make the
place otherwise reasonably safe within a reasonable time after receipt of
such notice.
§ 129-46. Transmission of notices of defects; corrective action.
The Superintendent of Public Works must transmit, in writing, to the Village
Clerk, within three days after receipt thereof, all written notices received by
§ 129-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 129-46
1:185
him pursuant to this Article, and he must take any and all corrective action
with respect thereto as soon as practicable.
§ 129-47. Record of notices.
The Village Clerk must keep an index record, in a separate book, of all
written notices which the Village Clerk receives of the existence of
defective, unsafe, dangerous or obstructed conditions in or upon, or of an
accumulation of ice or snow upon, any village highway, bridge, culvert or
sidewalk or any other property owned by the village or by any improvement
district, which record must state the date of the receipt of the notice,
the nature and location of the condition stated to exist and the name and
address of the person from whom the notice is received. The record of
such notice must be preserved for a period of five years from the date it
is received. The Village Clerk, upon receipt of such written notice, must
immediately and in writing notify the Superintendent of Public Works of the
receipt of such notice.
§ 129-48. Effect on other provisions.
Nothing contained in this Article may repeal or modify or waive any existing
requirement or statute of limitations which is applicable to these causes
of action, but, on the contrary, the provisions of this Article are additional
requirements to the rights to maintain such action. Nothing contained
herein modifies any existing rule of law relative to the question of
contributory negligence, nor imposes upon the village, its officers and
employees and/or any of its improvement districts any greater duty or
obligations than it must keep streets, sidewalks and public places in a
reasonably safe condition for public use and travel.

Subdivision Approval Process
§ 133-7. Sketch plan approval.
A. The purpose of the sketch plan phase is to provide the subdivider with
an opportunity to consult early and informally in the subdivision
process with the Planning Board in order to save time and money and to
improve the opportunity for more desirable development.
B. A sketch plan shall be submitted to the Planning Board for informal
review for all major subdivisions. The sketch plan should show the
location of the subdivision, all existing structures, wooded areas,
significant physical features, existing utilities and community resources
and the proposed pattern of lots, streets, drainage, open space and
water and sewer facilities.
C. The subdivider shall appear before the Planning Board to present the
proposed sketch plan and to receive information that may be necessary
to process the request. The subdivider may meet with the Planning
Board prior to preparing the sketch plan to discuss procedural matters
as well as pertinent development requirements and potential concerns,
including but not limited to the design of streets, reservations of land,
local development policies, drainage and erosion control and slope
stabilization measures, water retention facilities, sewerage, water
supply and fire protection.
D. Subdividers of land adjoining state or county highways are advised to
consult with the Resident Engineer of the New York State Department
of Transportation or the County Highway Department at the sketch
plan stage in order to resolve problems of street openings or
stormwater drainage at the earliest possible stage in the design
process.
E. Where public utilities are involved, the subdivider's engineer should
contact the appropriate agencies for connection specifications and
capacity requirements as well as other pertinent construction
standards.
F. The Planning Board shall determine whether the sketch plan meets the
purposes of this chapter and if the proposal is consistent with existing
or potential development of adjacent areas and the Village
Comprehensive Plan. The Planning Board shall inform the applicant of
the actions to be taken to meet the requirements of this chapter. The
requirements for compliance with SEQR shall also be discussed at this
stage. The Planning Board may, if it deems it appropriate, refer a copy
of the sketch plan to the Village Engineer or any other village official for
review and report.
G. Within 45 days following the receipt of a complete sketch plan, the
Planning Board shall transmit a written report to the applicant

1:195
§ 133-8. Preliminary plat approval.
containing its comments concerning the design of the proposed project.
Copies of minutes of relevant meetings of the Planning Board shall be
considered a sufficient written report. The time frame within which the
Planning Board is required to act may be extended by mutual consent
of the Planning Board and the applicant.
A. A preliminary plat shall be prepared and submitted to the Planning
Board for all proposed subdivisions. The preliminary plat shall be
clearly marked "preliminary plat" and shall satisfy the requirements for
preliminary layouts as described in Article V of this chapter. Preliminary
plats for major subdivisions should comply with the recommendations
made by the Planning Board in its report on the sketch plan. A
completed environmental assessment form shall also be submitted at
this time.

the notification of decision and one copy shall be retained by the
Planning Board. The other copies shall be used for necessary
coordination with other agencies or consultants.
E. The Planning Board shall study the preliminary plat, taking into
consideration the topography of the area, the requirements of the
community and the best use of the land proposed to be subdivided.
Particular attention shall be given to the arrangement, location and
width of streets, their relation to the topography of the land, water and
sewer services, drainage, lot sizes and arrangements, the future
development of adjoining lands as yet unsubdivided and the
requirements of the village's zoning regulations30 and Comprehensive
Plan. In the review of the preliminary plat, the Planning Board shall
consult with the Village Engineer and such other officials or agencies as
may be appropriate. The Village Engineer shall report to the Planning
Board concerning the adequacy of the engineering features shown on
the preliminary plat.
F. Within 62 days following the receipt of a complete and satisfactory
preliminary plat and supporting documentation, including a completed

the subdivider shall be provided with written notification of the action
by the Planning Board within five days of the decision. In the event that
the Planning Board fails to take action on a preliminary plat within the
time frame prescribed herein, such plat shall be deemed to have been
granted preliminary approval. The certificate of the Village Clerk as to
the date of submission and the failure to take action within such
prescribed time shall be issued on demand and shall be sufficient in lieu
of written endorsement or other evidence of approval.
A. Within six months of receiving approval from the Planning Board on a
preliminary plat, with or without modification, the applicant may
submit a final plat for approval by the Planning Board. The final plat
shall be accompanied by the remainder of the subdivision fees as
specified by the fee schedule adopted by the Village Board.31
B. If more than six months have elapsed between the time of the Planning
Board's decision on the preliminary plat and the submission of the final
plat, the Planning Board may require a resubmission of the preliminary
plat prior to accepting the proposed final plat if it determines that
conditions affecting the plat have changed significantly in the interim. If
the Planning Board determines that the preliminary plat shall be
resubmitted, the Planning Board shall conduct another public hearing
on the proposed subdivision.
C. A tracing on Mylar plus six copies of the tracing and other exhibits
required for approval, as specified herein and as described in the
village's Design Criteria and Construction Specifications, shall be
submitted with the application for final plat approval. When submitting

does not constitute acceptance by the village of the dedication of such
facilities. Evidence of all necessary easements or easement documents,
if appropriate, as well as any other legal documents requested by the
Planning Board shall be submitted with the final plat.
D. The subdivider may choose to develop the subdivision in stages. If such
staging is proposed, the developer shall submit the final plat for a
portion of the area encompassed by the preliminary plat, provided that
the proposed development stages were indicated on the preliminary
plat approved by the Planning Board. A section shall include at least
25% of the total number of lots contained in the approved plat. No more
than two individual sections of a subdivision shall be in process or

approved by the Planning Board. It shall incorporate any modifications
or other features that may have been recommended by the Planning
Board at the preliminary plat stage. All such compliances shall be
clearly indicated by the subdivider on the submission.
F. Within 62 days of the receipt of a complete and satisfactory final plat
which the Planning Board deems to be in substantial agreement with
the preliminary plat approved pursuant to this Article, the Planning
Board shall, by resolution, conditionally approve, with or without
modification, disapprove or grant final approval and authorize the
signing of such plat.
G. When a final plat is submitted which the Planning Board deems not to
be in substantial agreement with the preliminary plat approved
pursuant to this Article, the following shall apply:
(1) Final plats not in substantial agreement with approved preliminary
plats may require further review under the State Environmental
Quality Review (SEQR) Act.32

approved plat in the Office of the County Clerk, the entire approved plat
shall be filed with the Village Clerk within 30 days of the filing of such
section. Any section of the approved plat which is filed in the Office of
the County Clerk shall encompass at least 25% of the total number of
lots contained in the approved plat. The approval of the remaining
sections of the approved plat shall expire unless said sections are filed
before the expiration of the exemption period to which such plat is
entitled under the provisions of Village Law.
A. The Planning Board shall approve or disapprove minor subdivision final
plats in accordance with the provisions of this section.

§ 133-11. Resubdivision; lot line adjustments.
For a resubdivision, the same procedure shall apply as for a subdivision.
If the proposed resubdivision consists solely of the simple alteration of lot
lines where no additional lots would be created, the Planning Board may
waive the normal subdivision procedures and merely require the filing of
an approved resubdivision plat. A statement indicating such shall be part
of the Board's record on the subdivision. Notification of the purpose for the
division (i.e. lot line adjustment) shall be shown on the plat and in the deeds.
Tax numbers shall be reassigned to the new legal descriptions.
§ 133-12. Coordination with State Environmental Quality Review
Act.
A. Preliminary plats and final plats where no preliminary plat was required
shall not be considered complete until a negative declaration has been
filed or until a notice of completion of the draft environmental impact
statement has been filed. The time periods for review of a preliminary
plat shall begin upon filing of such negative declaration or such notice
of completion.
B. When the Planning Board is lead agency under the State Environmental
Quality Review Act (SEQR), any public hearing held by the Planning
Board on a preliminary plat, on a final plat where no preliminary plat
was required, or on a final plat which does not substantially conform to
an approved preliminary plat, shall be coordinated with the
environmental review process as follows:
(1) If the Planning Board determines that the preparation of an
environmental impact statement is not required, the public hearing
on the plat shall be held within 62 days after the receipt of a
complete preliminary plat; or,
(2) If the Planning Board determines that the preparation of an
environmental impact statement is required, and a public hearing
on the draft environmental impact statement is held, the public
hearing on the plat and the draft environmental impact statement
shall be held jointly within 62 days after the filing of the notice of
completion of such draft environmental impact statement. If no
public hearing is held on the draft environmental impact statement,
the public hearing on the plat shall be held within 62 days of filing
the notice of completion.
(3) The hearing on the plat shall be advertised at least once in a
newspaper of general circulation in the village at least five days
before such hearing if held independently of the hearing on the
draft environmental impact statement, or 14 days before a hearing
held jointly therewith. The hearing on the plat shall be completed
within 120 days after it has begun.
§ 133-11 WARSAW CODE § 133-12
1:202
(4) If the Planning Board determines that an environmental impact
statement is required, and a public hearing is held on the draft
environmental impact statement, the final environmental impact
statement shall be filed within 45 days following the close of such
public hearing. If no public hearing is held on the draft
environmental impact statement, the final environmental impact
statement shall be filed within 62 days following the close of the
public hearing on the plat. Within 30 days of the filing of such final
environmental impact statement, the Planning Board shall issue
findings on the final environmental impact statement and make its
decision on the plat.
C. If the Planning Board is not lead agency under the State Environmental
Quality Review Act, any public hearing held by the Planning Board on a
preliminary plat, on a final plat where no preliminary plat was required
or on a final plat which does not substantially conform to an approved
preliminary plat shall be coordinated with the environmental review
process as follows:
(1) The Planning Board shall, with the agreement of the lead agency,
hold the public hearing on the plat jointly with the lead agency's
hearing on the draft environmental impact statement. Failing such
agreement, the Planning Board shall hold the public hearing on the
plat within 62 days after the receipt of a complete plat by the Clerk
of the Planning Board.
(2) The hearing on the plat shall be advertised at least once in a
newspaper of general circulation in the village at least five days
before such hearing if held independently of the hearing on the
draft environmental impact statement, or 14 days before a hearing
held jointly therewith. The Planning Board may provide that the
hearing be further advertised in such a manner as it deems most
appropriate for full public consideration of such plat. The hearing
on the final plat shall be completed within 120 days after it has
begun.

submitted indicating the location of monuments marking all
underground utilities as actually installed. Said map shall be submitted
§ 133-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 133-13
1:205
§ 133-14. Letter of credit alternative.
prior to the endorsement of the plat by the Chairman of the Planning
Board, or designee.
E. The Planning Board may waive, when reasonable, any requirements or
improvements for the approval, approval with modifications or
disapproval of subdivisions submitted for its approval. Any such waiver,
which shall be subject to appropriate conditions, may be exercised in
the event that any such requirements or improvements are found not to
be requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general
welfare or inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities adjacent or in proximity to the subdivision.
A. As an alternative to the completion of the required improvements, the
subdivider may file a certified check or irrevocable letter of credit to
cover the full cost of the required improvements deemed necessary by
the Planning Board with the Village Clerk. Any such letter of credit shall
comply with the requirements of § 7-730 of Village Law and shall be
satisfactory to the Planning Board, Village Board, Village Engineer and
Village Attorney as to form, sufficiency, manner of execution and surety.
The Planning Board shall determine an appropriate period of time [not
to exceed three years] set forth within the letter of credit within which
the required improvements shall be completed. The term of the security
agreement may, however, be extended by mutual agreement of the
Planning Board and the subdivider.
B. If the subdivider elects to provide a certified check or letter of credit for
all required improvements, such guaranty shall not be released until a
map satisfactory to the Planning Board has been submitted indicating
the location of all monuments marking all underground utilities as
actually installed. The Village Engineer shall provide written
certification that the improvements have been completed as required
by the Planning Board.
C. In the event that the subdivider is authorized to file the approved plat in
sections, as provided herein, approval of the plat may be granted upon
the installation of the required improvements in the section of the plat
filed in the Office of the Wyoming County Clerk or the furnishing of
security covering the costs of such improvements. The subdivider shall
not be permitted to begin construction in any other section until such
section has been filed in the Office of the County Clerk and the required
improvements have been installed in such section or security covering
the costs of such improvements is provided.
D. The letter of credit shall continue in full force and effect until a request
is made to the Mayor for a release from the letter of credit. The Mayor
shall submit the request to the Village Engineer for a recommendation.
Upon receipt of the Village Engineer's recommendation, the Mayor may
authorize the release of up to 90% of the total letter of credit. Before
the Mayor may approve the release of 90% of the letter of credit, the
§ 133-13 WARSAW CODE § 133-14
1:206
§ 133-15. Construction of improvements.
Village Engineer shall prepare a signed statement to the effect that: the
job is complete according to plans and specifications; the job has been
inspected by a licensed professional engineer; and all improvements
have been successfully tested. Before the final 10% release can be
requested by the subdivider, a maintenance bond covering two years
and equal to 10% of the cost of the project shall be posted and any
public roads shall be dedicated to the Village of Warsaw. Upon the
receipt of such a reply from the Village Engineer, the Mayor shall
authorize the final release of said letter of credit.
E. In the event that the subdivider is in default of compliance with the
conditions of this chapter or any other applicable village laws, such
letter of credit shall be forfeited to the village and used for the
completion of the required improvements. The village shall return to
the applicant any amount that is not needed to cover any costs incurred
by the village as a result of the applicant's default.
A. The village shall employ an inspector to act as agent of the Planning
Board for the purpose of assuring the satisfactory completion of all
improvements required by the Planning Board. The village shall
determine an amount sufficient to defray the costs of inspection. The
applicant shall pay the village for the costs of inspection before the final
plat is signed for filing. If the Planning Board or its agent finds, upon
inspection, that any of the required improvements have not been
constructed in accordance with Planning Board's recommendations or
the approved construction detail sheets, the applicant shall be liable for
the costs of completing said improvements according to the approved
specifications. No plat shall be approved by the Planning Board as long
as the subdivider is in default on a previously approved plat. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any lots for which the
subdivider is deemed to be in default.
B. If, at any time before or during the construction of the required
improvements, it is demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Village
Engineer that unforeseen conditions make it necessary or preferable to
modify the location or design of such required improvements, the
Village Engineer may, upon approval by a previously designated
member of the Planning Board, authorize such modifications, provided
that such modifications are within the spirit and intent of the Planning
Board's approval and do not extend to the waiver or substantial
alteration of the function of any improvements required by the Board.
The Village Engineer shall issue any authorization in writing and shall
transmit a copy of such authorization under this section to the Planning
Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The final plat
construction sheets shall be modified to reflect the changes authorized
by this section and made part of the subdivision file.
C. At least five days prior to commencing the construction of the required
improvements, the subdivider shall notify the Village Board, in writing,
§ 133-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 133-15
1:207
§ 133-16. Reservation of parkland.
of the time when the construction of such improvements is to begin.
This will enable the Village Board to have inspection services on site to
assure that all village specifications and requirements are met during
the construction of required improvements and to assure that the
improvements required by the Planning Board are satisfactorily
completed.
A. Before the Planning Board may approve a subdivision containing
residential units, the final plat shall also show, when required by the
Planning Board, a park or parks suitably located for playground or
other recreational purposes.
B. Land for park, playground or other recreational purposes may not be
required until the Planning Board has made a finding that a proper case
exists for requiring that a park or parks be suitably located for
playgrounds or other recreational purposes within the village. Such
findings shall include an evaluation of the present and anticipated
future needs for park and recreational facilities in the village based on
projected growth to which the particular final plat will contribute.
C. In the event that the Planning Board makes a finding pursuant to
Subsection B of this section that the proposed plat presents a proper
case for requiring a park or parks suitably located for playgrounds or
other recreational purposes, but that a suitable park or parks of
adequate size to meet the requirement cannot be properly located
within such plat, the Planning Board may require a sum of money in lieu
thereof, in an amount to be established by the Village Board. In making
such determination of suitability, the Board shall assess the size and
suitability of land shown on the plat which could be possible locations
for park or recreational facilities, as well as practical factors, including
whether there is a need for additional facilities in the immediate
neighborhood. Any money required by the Planning Board in lieu of
land for park, playground or other recreational purposes, pursuant to
the provisions of this section, shall be deposited into a trust fund to be
used by the village exclusively for park, playground or other
recreational purposes, including the acquisition of property.

ARTICLE VI
Design Standards
§ 133-20. General provisions.
The Planning Board, in reviewing an application for approval, shall be
guided by the considerations and standards presented in this Article. The
Planning Board shall take into consideration the prospective character of
the development and require that improvements be designed to ensure
the reasonable protection of the public health, safety, morals and general
welfare. In addition, all designs and improvements shall be in accordance
with the Village's Design Criteria and Construction Specifications.
§ 133-21. Lot size and arrangement.
The dimensions and arrangements of lots shall be such that there will be no
foreseeable difficulties, for reasons of topography, reservations, dedications
or other conditions, in providing access to buildings on such lots or in
securing building permits in compliance with existing zoning regulations as
well as other village requirements. The following regulations shall govern
the layout of lots:
A. Land to be subdivided or developed shall be of such character that it
can be used safely for building purposes without danger to health or
peril from fire, flood or other menace.
B. Proper provisions shall be made for drainage, water supply, sewage and
other needed improvements.
C. All proposed lots shall be so laid out and of such size as to be in
harmony with the development pattern of neighboring properties.
D. A safe and convenient street system, consistent with the Village's
Comprehensive Plan and conforming to the Official Map, if such exists,
shall be created. Streets shall be of such width, grade and location so as
to accommodate the type and volume of traffic that is anticipated, to
facilitate fire protection and to provide fire-fighting equipment with
access to buildings.
E. Provisions shall be made to reserve open spaces for parks and
playgrounds or to require recreation fees in lieu thereof, in order to
achieve the goals and objectives of the Village's Comprehensive Plan
and Official Map.
F. Insofar as possible, all existing features of the landscape, such as large
trees, rock outcrops, water sources, historic resources and other
significant assets that would add to the value of the site should be
preserved through effective subdivision design.
A. The lot size, width, depth, shape, orientation and the minimum building
setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and
for the type of development and use contemplated.
§ 133-20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 133-21
1:215
§ 133-22. Streets.
B. All lots shown on the subdivision plat must conform to the minimum
requirements of Chapter 163, Zoning, as to area and dimensions for the
zone in which the subdivision is located.
C. Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, where a plat
contains one or more lots which do not comply with the village's zoning
laws, application may be made to the Zoning Board of Appeals for an
area variance pursuant to § 7-712-b of the Village Law, without the
necessity of a decision or determination of an administrative official
charged with the enforcement of the zoning regulations. In reviewing
such application, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall request the
Planning Board to provide a written recommendation concerning the
proposed variance.
D. Each lot shall have access to a street built to the village's specifications.
E. Corner lots shall have extra width sufficient to comply with required
building setback lines on both streets as required by Chapter 163,
Zoning.
F. Where existing streets have been proposed for future widening, all
building setbacks shall be measured from the proposed right-of-way
line.
G. Side lines of lots shall generally be at right angles to straight streets
and radial to curved streets.
H. Block lengths and widths shall be appropriate to accommodate the size
of lots required by Chapter 163, Zoning, and to provide for convenient
access, circulation control and traffic safety.
I. Blocks intended for commercial or industrial use shall be designed
specifically for such purposes, with adequate space set aside for offstreet
parking and delivery facilities.
J. Double frontage lots will not, in general, be approved.
K. Where lots abut an existing state highway, either a system of marginal
access streets or a reverse frontage approach shall be used in order to
minimize the number of driveways and/or streets entering onto these
state highways.
A. Where the marginal access technique is employed, a nonaccess
easement shall be required along the rear portion of the lot next to and
parallel to the highway right-of-way line.
B. Where a watercourse separates the buildable area of a lot from the
street which provides access to the lot, provision shall be made for the
installation of a culvert or other drainage structure. Said culvert or
drainage structure shall be subject to the same design criteria and
review as all other stormwater drainage facilities in the subdivision.
§ 133-21 WARSAW CODE § 133-22
1:216
C. The following regulations shall govern the layout of streets:
(1) Subdivisions shall be designed so as to provide a street pattern
which is curvilinear in design. The design of the street pattern shall
be based upon a local residential or minor street pattern connected
to a residential collector street system.
(2) The arrangement of streets in a new subdivision shall provide for
the continuation of existing streets in adjoining areas or to reserve
space for future street extensions where the adjoining land has not
been developed.
(3) Local residential streets shall be designed so as to discourage
through traffic.
(4) All right-of-way street widths and street pavements shall be
measured at right angles or radial to the center line of the street.
All streets shall have a right-of-way of at least 60 feet in width and a
pavement width of not less than 30 feet unless hereinafter
otherwise provided. All streets shall be of asphalt pavement as
specified in the Design Criteria and Construction Specifications
approved by the Village Board.
(5) Whenever possible, streets should intersect at right angles. Streets
should not intersect at angles of less than 75°.
(6) Streets shall be constructed in accordance with the Design Criteria
and Construction Specifications approved by the Village Board. In
conjunction with these specifications, all streets proposed to be
dedicated to the village shall require:
(a) All materials to be hauled away to a depth of 24 inches.
(b) The use of good crushed gravel or stone filled to a depth of 16
inches, rolled and compacted in layers.
(c) The installation of a five-inch hot binder over compacted gravel
or stone and rolled properly.
(d) The installation of a three-inch top of fine hot asphalt over the
binder and compacted by a roller of proper size.
(e) That curbing may be preformed or installed with forms. When
curbing is preformed, cement must be used to hold the curbs in
place.
(f) That sidewalks shall be installed in four-foot squares and four
inches deep.
(7) All proposed subdivisions shall be designed to provide access to
adjacent properties. When a proposed subdivision abuts an existing
subdivision, the subdivider shall make every attempt to design the
§ 133-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 133-22
1:217
street system of the proposed subdivision to connect with dead-end
or stub streets of existing subdivisions.
(8) The following standards shall apply to cul-de-sac streets:
(a) If possible, all cul-de-sac streets should drain toward their
entrance.
(b) Unless there is the expectation of extending the street through
to the adjoining property, a cul-de-sac street should never be
brought to the property boundary line, but should be placed so
that lots can back onto the property line of the subdivision.
(c) No cul-de-sac shall exceed 500 feet in length.
(d) All cul-de-sac streets shall have a turnaround at the end of the
street with a right-of-way diameter of not less than 120 feet;
the outer curb at the turn shall have a minimum diameter of
100 feet, a twenty-foot pavement width and two thirty-inchwide
gutters that will permit a turning radius of 25 feet at the
inner curb.
(9) If a dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a similar turnaround
shall be provided and provisions made for the future extension of
the street through to the adjacent property and reversion of the
excess right-of-way to the adjoining properties.
(10)New half or partial streets shall not be permitted, except that
whenever a proposed subdivision borders a half or partial street,
the Planning Board may require that the other part of the street be
platted in the proposed tract if it determines that such a
requirement would increase the effectiveness of the circulation
system in the area.
(11) Multiple intersections involving the junction of more than two
streets shall not be permitted.
(12) Local residential streets and residential collector streets shall not
intersect with state highways less than 800 feet apart, measured
from center line to center line.
(13) The minimum distance between center line offsets at street jogs
shall be 150 feet.
(14)No street shall have a name which will duplicate, or so nearly
duplicate as to be confused with, the names of existing streets. The
continuation of an existing street shall have the same name.
(15) The minimum radius of horizontal curves, minimum length of
vertical curves and minimum length of tangents between reverse
curves shall be in accordance with specifications established by the
Village Engineer. Said items shall be approved by the Village
§ 133-22 WARSAW CODE § 133-22
1:218
§ 133-23. Alleys.
The following provisions shall govern the layout of alleys:
Engineer prior to final approval of the final plat by the Planning
Board.
(16) Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed
arterial street, the Planning Board may require special treatment of
the land areas bordering such street in order to protect residential
properties and to effectively separate through and local traffic.
(17) Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right-of-way,
the Planning Board may require a street or streets parallel to such
right-of-way in order to make appropriate use of the land adjacent
to such right-of-way.
(18) Property lines at street intersections shall be rounded with a radius
of 10 feet, or with a greater radius if deemed necessary by the
Planning Board.
(19) Curb radii at intersections shall be not less than 20 feet.
(20) Street grades, wherever feasible, shall not exceed the following,
with due allowance for reasonable vertical curves and with not less
than 200 feet between changes of grade:
Street Type
Maximum Grade
(percent)
Arterial 4
Collector 6
Minor 8
Marginal access 8
(21) In order to facilitate drainage, no street grade shall be less than
0.4%.
A. Alleys may be permitted in business, commercial and industrial
districts, although it is recommended that other definite and assured
provisions be made for service access, such as off-street loading,
unloading and parking that is adequate to serve the proposed use.
B. The width of an alley, if proposed, shall not be less than 20 feet.
C. Dead-end alleys shall generally not be allowed; however, if such is
unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround
facilities at the closed end, as required by the Planning Board.
§ 133-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 133-24
1:219
§ 133-24. Prevention of landlocked parcels.
No division of land shall result in any parcel not having at least one access
point to at least one street that can be improved to meet village standards.
Where the remainder of a parcel is located so that access to a public street
would be gained by a street extending from the main portion of the parcel,
there shall be enough land remaining to provide for the extension of a public
(or private) street from this parcel to an existing street.
§ 133-25. Buffers and berms.
Landscape buffers should be provided between marginal access streets and
state highways. Buffers may also be required in other areas, along with
berms, to reduce noise levels and undesirable vistas.
§ 133-26. Streams and drainageways.
Subdivision lots should be laid out as much as possible so that side or rear
lot lines follow the center line of a stream or drainageway that may be
within the subdivision. Thoroughfare crossings of streams shall be kept to a
minimum and shall generally be at right angles to the stream.
§ 133-27. Road intersections.
In general, all streets shall intersect in a manner so that, for a distance of
at least 100 feet from the intersection, each street shall be approximately
at right angles to the street it joins. No intersection of two streets shall be
within 200 feet of any other intersection.
§ 133-28. Provisions for future resubdivision.
If a tract is subdivided into lots which are more than two times as large as
the minimum size required in the zone district in which the subdivision is
located, the Planning Board may require that streets and lots are laid out
so as to permit future resubdivision in accordance with the requirements
contained in this chapter and Chapter 163, Zoning.
§ 133-29. Nonresidential subdivisions.
Standards for the design and construction of nonresidential subdivisions
shall be governed by sound engineering and planning practice. Utilities
shall be sized commensurate with the anticipated demand based upon the
full development of the subdivision.
§ 133-30. Self-imposed restrictions.
The owner of any property may impose greater restrictions on any
development than those required by the village's subdivision and zoning
regulations. Such restrictions, if any, shall be indicated on the preliminary
and final subdivision plats.
§ 133-24 WARSAW CODE § 133-31
1:220
§ 133-31. Easements.
A. An easement shall be provided for all natural drainageways and all
utility lines in those instances where such utility lines do not fall within
a dedicated right-of-way. All easements shall be plotted on the
preliminary plat and subdivision plat. A clause shall be inserted in the
deed of each lot affected by an easement indicating the existence and
purpose of the easement.
B. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainageway, channel or stream,
a drainageway easement, conforming substantially to the lines of such
watercourse, shall be provided. The easement shall be of such width as
will be adequate to preserve natural drainage and provide sufficient
width for maintenance.

railroads other than street surface, rapid transit, subway and elevated
railroads, and also includes every person, whether or not such person
is subject to such supervision, who sells gas, electricity, steam, water,
refrigeration or telephony delivered through mains, pipes or wires or
furnishes gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator, telephone or telegraph
service by means of mains, pipes or wires, regardless of whether such
activities are the main business of such person or are only incidental thereto
or of whether use is made of the public streets.
§ 137-3. Utilities to keep records.
Every utility subject to tax under this article shall keep such records of
its business and in such form as the Village Treasurer may require, and
such records shall be preserved for a period of three years, except that the
Village Treasurer may consent to their destruction within that period or may
require that they be kept longer.
§ 137-4. Utilities to file returns.
Every utility subject to tax hereunder shall file annually, on or before the
25th day of March, a return for the 12 calendar months preceding such
§ 137-2 WARSAW CODE § 137-4
1:224
return date or any portion thereof for which the tax imposed hereby is
effective; provided, however, that in lieu of the annual return required
by the foregoing provisions, any utility may file quarterly, on or before
September 25, December 25, March 25 and June 25, a return for the three
calendar months preceding each such return date and, in the case of the
first such return, for all preceding calendar months during which the tax
imposed hereby was effective. Every return shall state the gross income
or gross operating income for the period covered thereby. Returns shall
be filed with the Village Treasurer on a form to be furnished by him for
such purpose and shall contain such other data, information or matter as
he may require to be included therein. The Village Treasurer, in order to
ensure payment of the tax imposed, may require at any time a further or
supplemental return, which shall contain any data that may be specified
by him, and he may require any utility doing business in the Village of
Warsaw to file an annual return, which shall contain any data specified by
him, regardless of whether the utility is subject to tax under this article.
Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility
making the same, or of the owner or of a copartner thereof or of a principal
officer of the corporation if such business is conducted by a corporation, to
the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 137-5. Tax payable with return.
At the time of filing a return as required by this article, each utility shall
pay to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 137-6. Failure to submit acceptable return.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from him or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the person against whom
it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of such
determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing or unless the
Village Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same. After such
hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his decision to the
person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed by a
proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the
State of New York if application therefor is made within 90 days after
the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such decision
shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be
reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first
§ 137-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 137-6
1:225
§ 137-7. Giving of notice; presumptive evidence.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the persons for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice, shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 137-8. Penalties for offenses.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village Treasurer,
for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 137-9. Refunds. [Amended 3-27-1995 by L.L. No. 6-1995]
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However, no
refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination of
the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless the Village Treasurer,
after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion, shall have
deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him,
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve, to the effect that if such proceeding is dismissed
or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding, or, at the option of
the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties
as a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a
return; provided, however, that where no return has been filed as
required by this article, the tax may be assessed at any time.
§ 137-6 WARSAW CODE § 137-9
1:226
reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established in a proceeding
under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of the State of New York
that such determination was erroneous or illegal. All refunds shall be made
out of moneys collected under this article. An application for a refund, made
as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed an application for the revision
of any tax or penalty complained of, and the Village Treasurer may receive
additional evidence with respect thereto. After making his determination,
the Village Treasurer shall give notice thereof to the person interested, and
he shall be entitled to an order to review such determination under said
Article 78, subject to the provision hereinbefore contained relating to the

Senior Citizens Tax Exemption
[Adopted 11-1-1993 by L.L. No. 6-199335]
§ 137-15. Legislative intent and purpose.
The Village Board finds that the real property tax burden on homeowners
who are retired and living on a fixed income is made more difficult as a
result of recent federal legislation resulting in an increased income tax
burden for those receiving social security benefits. Therefore, the Village
Board wishes to ease the burden somewhat so that homes within the village
are more likely to remain in individual ownership by providing for partial
real property tax exemptions to persons over 65 years of age who meet
certain income standards.
§ 137-16. Exemption granted.
Real property owned by one or more persons, each of whom is 65 years of
age or over, or real property owned by husband and wife, one of whom is 65
years of age or over, may be exempt from taxation by the Village of Warsaw
to the extent of 50% of the assessed valuation thereof, provided that no
exemption may be granted unless the applicant meets all the criteria for an
exemption under Subdivision 3 of § 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, and
further provided that the income limitation is $10,000.
§ 137-17. Applications.
Applications may be obtained from the Board of Assessors.
§ 137-17.1. Changes in income limitation.
The income limitation set forth above in § 137-15 may be increased or
decreased by resolution of the Village Board after a public hearing.

§ 149-1. Purpose.
The seriousness of the matter of the outdoor storage of abandoned, junked,
discarded and unlicensed motor vehicles upon privately owned properties
within the village increases with the passage of time. It is a source of
vexation and annoyance, not only to the members of the traveling public,
but to the owners and occupants of adjoining lands. The outdoor storage of
such vehicles upon residential lands is unsightly. It constitutes an attractive
nuisance to children and a peril to their safety, in case of fire and explosion,
whenever gasoline is left in the fuel tanks of such vehicles. It depreciates
the value of neighboring properties. The preservation of peace and good
order, the supression of vice, the benefit of trade, the preservation of public
health, the protection of property and the prevention and extinguishment
of fires and explosions compel the Board of Trustees of the Village of
Warsaw to legislate upon this subject matter. It is hereby declared that the
adoption of this chapter has for its purpose the effective termination of such
obnoxious practice.
§ 149-2. Outdoor storage restricted. [Amended 11-3-1969]
It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation, either as owner,
occupant, lessee, agent, tenant or otherwise, to store or deposit or cause
or permit to be stored or deposited an abandoned, junked, discarded or
unlicensed motor vehicle or motor vehicles upon any land or upon the rightof-
way of any public street or highway within the corporate limits of the
Village of Warsaw. Except a bona fide used car dealer or garage may store
Warsaw. Poplars, willows and such other varieties of trees as the village
shall decide undesirable shade trees shall not be planted. Trees that are
approved by the Superintendent of Public Works shall be planted far
enough apart to allow for ample growth.

premises.
§ 149-3. Notice of violation.
If the provisions of the foregoing section are violated, the Village Clerk shall
serve written notice, either personally or by mail, upon the owner, occupant
or person having charge of any such land to comply with the provisions of
this chapter. The notice shall be in substantially the following form:
"To the owner, occupant or person having charge of land known on the
Assessment Map of the Village of Warsaw as Lot(s) _____, Number(s) _____,
Sheet _____, Block _____ or Number _____, Street or Avenue.
"Notice is hereby given that an abandoned, junked, discarded and
unlicensed motor vehicle has been found stored or deposited upon the
above-described property in the Village of Warsaw. This automobile must be
removed within five days from the date of this notice.
"In case you fail or refuse to comply with this notice on or before the
expiration of said five days from the date of this notice, the Village of
Warsaw, acting through its duly authorized agents, servants, officers and
employees, will enter upon your land and remove and cause the same to be
destroyed. The expense incurred by the village will be assessed against the
above-described land and shall constitute a lien thereon and be collected as
provided by law.

provisions of this chapter or who shall resist or obstruct the duly authorized
agents, servants, officers and employees of the village on the removal and
destruction thereof shall, upon conviction thereof, be guilty of a violation

ARTICLE I
Purpose and Definitions
§ 157-1. Purpose.
In order to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of
the Village of Warsaw and for the purpose of protecting the environment,
the potable water supply sources, watercourses, tributaries and/or water
reservoirs and to ensure that the users of the potable water system fairly
and reasonably share the cost of the Village of Warsaw water delivery
system, the rules and regulations contained in this chapter have been
adopted by the Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Warsaw.
§ 157-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AIR-GAP SEPARATION  A physical break between the supply pipe and
receiving vessel. The air gap must be at double the diameter of the supply
pipe, measured vertically above the top rim of the vessel and in no case less
than one inch.
APPROVED CHECK VALVE  A check valve that seats readily and
completely. It must be machined to have free-moving parts and be
watertight. The face of the closure element and valve seat must be of bronze
or other noncorrodible material which will seal tightly. Pins and bushings
must be bronze or other noncorrodible, nonsticking material machined
for easy, dependable operation. The closure element (clapper) must be
internally weighted or otherwise equipped to promote rapid and positive
closure in all sizes.
APPROVED DOUBLE-CHECK-VALVE ASSEMBLY  An assembly of at least
two independently acting check valves which include tightly closing shutoff
valves on each side of the check valve assembly, suitable leak detector
drains and connections available for testing the water-tightness of each
check valve. This device must be approved as a complete assembly.
APPROVED REDUCED PRESSURE PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION
DEVICE  A device incorporating two or more check valves, an
automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two
checks, two shutoff valves and the necessary appurtenances for testing. The
device must prevent the pressure in the zone between the two check valves
from exceeding the pressure on the public water supply side of the device.
At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between check valves must be
less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check valve, the
differential relief valve must operate to maintain this reduced pressure by
discharging to the atmosphere thereby providing an air gap in the device.
These devices must be readily accessible for maintenance and testing and
installed in a location where no part of the valve will be submerged. The
enclosure must drain such that the water vented by the relief valve will
§ 157-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 157-2
1:281
be ejected without submergence of the relief valve. This device must be
approved as a complete assembly.
AUXILIARY SUPPLY  Any water supply on or available to the premises,
other than the water supply.
CERTIFIED BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE TESTER  A person who is
certified annually by the State of New York for testing backflow prevention
devices. He shall be provided with an appropriate identification card.
CHLORIDE SALT  Solid compounds or solutions of potassium chloride
(commonly used as fertilizer), calcium chloride (commonly used for winter
road maintenance) or sodium chloride (commonly used for water softener
regeneration).
CONSUMER  Any user of water or any owner of property serviced by the
village water system.
CROSS-CONNECTIONS  Any unprotected connection between any part
of a water system used or intended to supply water for drinking purposes
and any source or system containing water or a substance that is not or
cannot be approved as equally safe, wholesome and potable for human
consumption.
HUMAN EXCRETA  Human feces and urine.
JUNKYARD  An area where inoperable equipment or motor vehicles are
being accumulated for purposes of disposal, sale of used parts or
reclamation of materials, such as metal, glass or fabric.
LINEAR DISTANCE  The shortest horizontal distance from the nearest
point of a structure or object to the high-water mark of a reservoir or to
the edge, margin or steep bank forming the ordinary high-water line of a
watercourse.
POLLUTANT  Dredge, spoil, solid waste, incinerator residue, sewage,
garbage, sewage sludge, chemical waste, biological materials, radioactive
materials, heat, wrecked or discarded equipment, rock, sand, cellar dirt and
industrial, municipal and agricultural waste discharged into water.
RADIOACTIVE MATERIAL  Any material in any form that emits radiation
spontaneously. "Radiation" is ionizing radiation, any alpha particle, beta
particle, gamma ray, X-ray, neutron, high-speed proton and any other atomic
particle producing ionization, but not any sound or radio wave or visible,
infrared or ultraviolet light.
REFUSE  All solid wastes, including garbage, manure, rubbish, ashes,
incinerator residue, street cleanings, dead animals, offal and solid
commercial and industrial wastes.
REFUSE DISPOSAL AREA  Land used for the deposit of refuse, except
refuse from a single family, a member of which is the owner, occupant or
lessee of said land, or any part of a farm on which only animal wastes
resulting from the operation of such farm are deposited.
§ 157-2 WARSAW CODE § 157-2
1:282
SEWAGE  Any liquid or solid waste matter from a domestic, commercial,
private or industrial establishment which is normally carried off in sewer or
waste pipes.
SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM  Any system used for disposing of sewage.
SUPERINTENDENT  The Superintendent of Public Works of the Village of
Warsaw or any village employee authorized to act in his place.
TOXIC CHEMICAL  Any compound or substance which is harmful or
poisonous to humans, including but not limited to gasoline, kerosene, fuel
oil or diesel oil.
TREATMENT WORKS  Any treatment plant, sewer, disposal field, lagoon,
pumping station, septic system, constructed drainage ditch, surface water
intercepting ditch, incinerator, area devoted to sanitary landfill or other
works not specifically mentioned in this definition installed for the purpose
of treating, neutralizing, stabilizing or disposing of sewage.
VILLAGE  The Village of Warsaw, County of Wyoming, State of New York,
acting through its Board of Trustees.
WATERCOURSE  Every spring, stream, marsh or channel of water of any
kind which flows or may flow into the village water supply.
WATERSHED  The entire drainage area contributing water to the village
water supply.
WATER SOURCE  Any reservoir, creek, stream, river tributary or any
other source supplying water to the village water system.

Water Use Regulations
§ 157-3. Establishment of rules; compliance required.
The following rules and regulations are established by the village. These
rules and regulations constitute the terms of a contract between the
consumer and the village. The consumer must strictly comply with said
rules and regulations.
§ 157-4. Application for service; installation to be approved.
Consumers desiring water from the village must make a written application
to the Village Clerk stating the intended use of water. The application must
be signed by the consumer or his duly authorized agent. Once a permit is
issued, the consumer must employ installers who are registered with the
village. Water will be turned on only after installation is approved by the
Superintendent and all expenses and water rates have been paid.
§ 157-5. Expenses; maintenance of service.
§ 157-6. Determination of equipment; installation.
The village or the Superintendent will determine the size of the taps to be
inserted in any water main; the form and size of the curb box to be used;
the type of corporation stop; and the type of curb stop. The tap, equipment
and line from the main to the curb must be installed by the village and will
remain the property of the village; however, the cost of installation will be
that of the consumer. The insertion of taps, tees and connections in any
water main must only be completed by the Superintendent.
§ 157-7. Placement of curb and street boxes.
Curb boxes and street boxes must be neatly cut off and the top of the box
must be even with the surface of the material in which it is placed.
§ 157-8. Distance of service below the surface.
The service must be installed at least four feet below the surface, unless the
Superintendent grants written authorization to vary from this requirement.
A. The consumer must pay all expenses involved with the flow of water
from the curb box to a use outlet to include the installation of the water
meter and any new or discontinued service. The consumer need not pay
for the cost of the water meter [unless it is larger than 3/4 inches] and
once installed it remains the property of the village.
B. The consumer must maintain the water service in a satisfactory and
sufficient condition. The service may be inspected at any time by the
Superintendent, who may shut off the water supply after notice if the
consumer fails to comply with this section.
§ 157-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 157-9
1:285
§ 157-9. Distance from sewer lines.
All new water lines must be installed at least 10 feet from sewer lines
(public or private), unless the Superintendent grants written authorization
to vary from this requirement.
§ 157-10. Service lines.
Service lines must be K-Copper and at least 3/4 inch inside diameter and
approved by the Superintendent. All piping must include a corporation cock
at the main and a service cock and extension service box between the walk
and curblines. The line must be inspected by the Superintendent before it is
covered. A stop- and waste cock must be located inside the basement wall
where the service pipe enters.
§ 157-11. Initiation of service; permit required.
Water service may be initiated only after the work is completed in
accordance with the rules and regulations set forth herein. No water may
flow to the premises without the permit from the Village Clerk, and upon
completion of installation, the installer must close the curb cock until said
permit is received. If a permit has already been issued and the water is in
use, the installer may leave the curb cock open and the consumer will be
charged for any additional use from the date of application.
§ 157-12. Interruption of service.
§ 157-13. Shared service.
Water may not be supplied to two or more buildings from a single tap except
with the approval of the Superintendent.
§ 157-14. Equipment inspection; waste.
The Superintendent may enter the premises of any consumer at any
reasonable time to examine and inspect the water meter, the pipes, fixtures,
A. The village will use reasonable care to maintain a constant supply of
pure water for consumers but reserves the right at such times as it

outlets, the quantity of water used and the manner of its use. In case
of fraud or waste of water by the consumer, all payments made will be
forfeited and the water service terminated.
§ 157-15. Leaks.
If leaks occur in the service lines between the curb box and the meter, the
Village Clerk and the Superintendent will estimate the amount of water lost
and charge the consumer.
§ 157-16. Discontinuance of service; resumption.
A consumer wishing to discontinue service must give written notice thereof
to the Village Clerk. Whenever water has been turned off by the village for
nonpayment or a violation of any rule or regulation, it may not be turned on
again until the party in default has paid all amounts due.
§ 157-17. Use of unmetered water by contractors.
No contractor may take unmetered water until obtaining a permit from
the Village Clerk. The contractor will be billed in accordance with § 157-22
below.
§ 157-18. Tampering with fire hydrants, valves and mains.
No person may open any fire plug or hydrant nor draw water therefrom
except by permission of the Superintendent; except that the Warsaw Fire
Department and its members are authorized to use the hydrants for the
purpose of extinguishing fires and cleaning and testing its engines and
equipment under the supervision and direction of the Chief or the Assistant
Chiefs of the Fire Department. Tampering with valves and gates in the
street mains is prohibited.

1:287
§ 157-20. Protection of water lines from freezing; thawing water
lines.
§ 157-21. Water emergencies.
The village may declare a water emergency during which the
Superintendent may prohibit or limit the use of water by consumers.
§ 157-22. Water rates.
F. Meters may be tested upon request. If any meter so tested is found to
be registering correctly, running slowly or no more than 2% too fast, the
expense of testing will be paid by the consumer. The cost will be
determined by the village in accordance with § 157-22 below. The
Superintendent may at any reasonable time and at the expense of the
village remove and/or test the water meter for the purpose of
determining its accuracy.
A. Where service lines are not at a sufficient depth to prevent freezing, the
Superintendent may require the consumer to lower the service. Upon
failure to do so, the village may discontinue the service.
B. The consumer must receive permission from the Superintendent before
attempting to thaw a frozen service. The Superintendent will uncover
the curb box and insert a street key for the welder connection. An
attempt will be made to thaw the service line between the curb box and
the water main. If successful, the cost will be paid by the village. If
service is frozen between the curb box and the outlet, the consumer will
pay the cost. The consumer may be required by the village to keep the
water running to prevent further freezing. In that event an equitable
adjustment of the water bill will be made by the village.
A. The village will establish rates and charges for consumer use of water
services and equipment. Rates and charges may differ for use outside
the village limits. The rates and charges may be amended from time to
time by resolution of the village and may include but are not limited to:
meter rates; minimum rates; flat rates; bulk rates; water meters; meter
testing, installations; late charges; discontinuance of service;
maintenance; repairs; thawing; and penalties as set forth elsewhere in
this Article.
B. Water usage will be billed quarterly or at such other time as determined
by resolution of the village.
C. No consumer may claim any credit towards a water bill unless granted
by resolution of the village.
D. All rates and charges are due and payable at the office of the Village
Clerk within 30 days of the date of the quarterly bill. If a quarterly bill is
not received, the consumer must inquire with the Village Clerk. The
absence of a bill does not excuse quarterly payment of water rates. If

§ 157-23. Fire sprinkler systems.
There will be no charge for water service used exclusively for automatic fire
suppression systems. The consumer must maintain the service pipes and
system in its entirety from the street main into the premises serviced.
§ 157-24. Tampering with system prohibited.
It shall be unlawful for any person except the Superintendent to interfere
with, tamper with or adversely affect water, its supply, the headwaters,
watershed or any part of the village water system. Water may not be
taken from any hydrant or any source, except as otherwise specified in this
Article.
§ 157-25. Penalties for offenses.
Any violation of the rules and regulations contained in this Article is
punishable by a fine of not more than $100 or by imprisonment for a term
not exceeding 15 days, or by both such fine and imprisonment.
the bill is not paid when due, a penalty of 10% will be added to the
bill. If it is not paid within 60 days, the service may be terminated until
the bill is paid in full. An additional service charge must be paid to
resume the water service. All charges for materials furnished or work
completed by the village in connection with the water service will be
billed as water charges.
E. All charges, rates, penalties, service charges and fines described in this
Article will become a lien upon the real property serviced until paid. If
said sums are not paid when demanded, water service may be
terminated and a reconnection charge imposed for resumption of
service. The Village Clerk will maintain records of nonpayment, and any
person may receive a certificate indicating the status of payment of
water bills affecting any particular premises serviced by the village
water system. A conveyance of real property subject to an unpaid water
bill will result in the new owner being responsible for all amounts due.
Nothing herein contained will prevent the village from using any other
means of collecting unpaid water charges. The village may assess said
amount against the property, together with the annual village tax, and
may collect it with the village tax in the same manner as any other local
assessment.

ARTICLE III
Water Supply Protection
§ 157-26. Cross-connections.
No consumer may install or maintain any cross-connection from any
auxiliary supply. If such cross-connection exists, service will be terminated
to prevent contamination of the water supply. The consumer must
disconnect the auxiliary supply before resuming water service from the
village water system. Where required by the New York State Department
of Health Sanitary Code or by the Superintendent, a backflow prevention
device of a type currently approved by the New York State Department of
Health must be installed.
§ 157-27. Inspection of protection devices.
On any premises where a backflow prevention device exists, the consumer
must conduct an inspection of said device at least annually and at any
time directed by the Superintendent. The consumer must pay the cost
of installation, repair or replacement. Testing must be performed by a
registered installer, and all test results must be provided to the
Superintendent within 72 hours of the test. Records of such tests, repairs or
replacements must be kept and made available to the Superintendent and
the Wyoming County Health Department.
§ 157-28. Separate drinking water systems.
The Superintendent may order the installation of separate drinking water
systems at points convenient for consumers.
§ 157-29. Fire systems.
Water for fighting fire obtained from an auxiliary supply must be kept
separate from drinking water pipelines and equipment. When water is used
for both drinking and fire-fighting purposes, approved backflow prevention
devices must be installed to protect such individual drinking waterlines
as are not used for fire-fighting purposes. Any auxiliary supply which is
so connected that it may be introduced into potable water piping during
an emergency must be equipped with an approved automatic chlorination
machine. The person causing the introduction of said unapproved or unsafe
water into the pipelines must develop and execute a procedure to notify
and protect users of the water system during the emergency and must take
special precautions to thoroughly disinfect and flush out all pipelines which
may become contaminated before they are again used to furnish drinking
water.
§ 157-30. Process water.
Potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial processes
or operations must be protected by a suitable backflow prevention device
located beyond the last point from which drinking water may be taken,
§ 157-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 157-30
1:291
which device must be provided on the feed line to process piping or
equipment. In the event that the particular process liquid is especially
corrosive or apt to prevent reliable action of the backflow prevention device,
air-gap separation must be provided.
§ 157-31. Sewage treatment plants and pumping stations.
Sewage pumps must not have priming connections directly off any drinking
water systems. No connections may exist between the drinking water
system and any other piping, equipment or tank in any sewage treatment
plant or sewage pumping station.
§ 157-32. Non-potable-water lines.
Where premises contain more than one water system (either village or
private), the exposed portions of pipelines must be painted, banded or
marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water is safe
and which is not. All outlets must be properly marked as being unsafe or
safe for drinking purposes. A water supervisor must be designated who
will be responsible for the installation and use of pipelines and equipment
and for the avoidance of cross-connections. In the event of contamination
or pollution of the drinking water system due to a cross-connection on
the premises, the Superintendent and Wyoming County Health Department
must be promptly notified.
§ 157-33. Compliance required.
No water service may be installed or maintained unless the water supply is
protected as required by state regulations and this Article.
§ 157-34. Discontinuance of service.
Service to any premises may be terminated if a backflow prevention device
required by this Article is not installed, tested and maintained; if any defect
is found in an installed backflow prevention device; if a backflow prevention
device has been removed or bypassed; or, if unprotected cross-connections
exist on the premises. Service will not be restored until such conditions or
defects are corrected.

of a subsurface sewage disposal system may be constructed, placed
or allowed to remain within a linear distance of 50 feet of the water
source.
(5) Every watertight receptacle used for containing human excreta or
sewage must be emptied when the receptacle is filled to within six
inches of the top. In emptying a watertight receptacle or in
transferring its contents to a transportable receptacle, all
necessary care must be exercised to prevent contamination of the
water source. All such transportable receptacles must be provided
with tightly-fitting covers which are securely fastened when
transporting wastes to the place of ultimate disposal. The contents
of the watertight receptacles must be disposed of in accordance
with Subsection D(1), (2) and (3) or at a properly designed,
constructed and operated sewage disposal system that has been
approved by the appropriate state agency having jurisdiction over
such facility.
(6) Before any existing sewage disposal system is altered or any new
sewage disposal system is constructed in the watershed, the plans
in relation thereto must have been first approved by the
appropriate state agency having jurisdiction over such facility.
E. No radioactive material may be disposed of by burial in the soil in the
watershed.

General Provisions
§ 163-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Zoning Ordinance of
the Village of Warsaw."
§ 163-2. Purpose.
For the purpose of promoting the health, safety and general welfare of
the people of the Village of Warsaw, this chapter is adopted pursuant to
Article 7 of the Village Law of the State of New York. Its purpose is to
regulate and restrict the height, number of stories and size of buildings
and other structures; the percentage of lot that may be occupied; the size
of yards, courts and other open space; the density of population and the
location and use of buildings, structures and land for business, industry,
agriculture, residence or other purposes. Such Zoning Law and the Zoning
Map, which is a part of said Zoning Law, are designed to lessen congestion
in the streets; to secure safety from fire and other dangers; to provide
adequate light and air; to provide for solar access and the implementation
of solar energy systems; to prevent the overcrowding of land and to avoid
undue concentration of population; to facilitate the efficient and adequate
provision of public facilities and services; and to provide the maximum
protection to residential areas from the encroachment of adverse
environmental influences. Such Zoning Law and Zoning Map were enacted
after reasonable consideration, among other things, as to the character
of the village and its peculiar suitability for particular uses, to conserve
property values and natural resources and to encourage the most
appropriate use of land throughout the village.
§ 163-3. Interpretation.
In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall
be held to be the minimum standards and requirements for the protection
of the public health, safety and general welfare.

Whenever the requirements of this chapter are at variance with the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, ordinances
or laws, the most restrictive or those imposing the higher standards shall
govern.
§ 163-5. Compliance with SEQR required.
Prior to any action by a municipal board or official on any application
made in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, the village shall
satisfy the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review (SEQR)

chapter.
B. Filing of petition. A petition to amend, change or supplement the text of
this chapter or any zoning district as designated on the Zoning Map
established herein shall be filed with the Village Clerk and shall be
transmitted by the Clerk to the Village Board. A petition for a change to
the Zoning Map shall contain a map which clearly describes the

for an advisory report. In reporting to the Village Board, the Planning
Board shall fully state its reasons for recommending or opposing the
adoption of such proposed amendment. The Planning Board may
condition its approval, as may be appropriate, and shall state whether
such amendment is in harmony with the village's Comprehensive Plan.
The Planning Board shall state its position relative to proposed zoning
amendments, in writing, within 45 days of its referral from the Village
Board. Absence of a reply from the Planning Board within the forty-fiveday
period shall indicate that the Board is in favor of the proposed

the provisions of the Village Law of the State of New York pertaining to
public hearings, official notices and proper recording of zoning actions
taken by the Village Board shall apply to all proposed amendments to
this chapter.
E. Disposition final; rehearing on petition. The disposition of a petition for
amendment by the Village Board shall be final, and disapproval or
denial of the proposed amendment shall void the petition. No new
petition for an amendment which has been previously denied by the
Village Board shall be considered by it, except for a vote to table or to
receive and file, and no public hearing shall be held on such amendment
within a period of one year from the date of such previous denial unless
the Planning Board shall submit a recommendation, with reasons stated
therefor, certifying that there have been substantial changes in the

§ 163-14 WARSAW CODE § 163-15
1:322
(1) Each application for a zoning permit which is dependent upon site
development plan approval by the Planning Board shall initially be
made to the Code Enforcement Officer. The Code Enforcement
Officer shall determine the application's completeness. Upon the
Code Enforcement Officer's acceptance of a complete site
development plan application, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
prepare a written response to the applicant containing the
following information:
(a) The date of the Planning Board meeting at which the
application for site development plan approval will be
discussed.
(b) A preliminary indication under SEQR to include the type of
action involved and any additional SEQR forms to be
completed by the applicant or agent.
(c) A determination whether any portion of the site will be affected
by the FP-O Floodplain Overlay District regulations and what
effects this will have on the application.
(d) A tentative time schedule for site development plan approval.
(e) Any other information the Code Enforcement Officer deems
appropriate, including fees and criteria for site development
plan preparation.
(2) In the event that a site development plan identifies the potential
need for dimensional variances, the applicant shall first be denied
preliminary site development plan approval by the Planning Board
before appealing the need for such variance(s) to the Zoning Board
of Appeals. Where the Planning Board has denied such site
development plan on these grounds, the Planning Board shall
convey its opinion to the Board of Appeals on the requested
variances. Once variances have been granted, the applicant may
proceed for site development plan approval. If the variances are
denied, the applicant shall submit a revised site development plan
complying with the dimensional requirements of the zoning
district.
(3) The Planning Board shall, for each site development plan
application, determine whether a public hearing would serve a
community benefit. According to such a determination by the
Planning Board, the process for site development plan approval,
including the timetables for making decisions, shall coincide with
that set forth in § 163-14 above.
(4) The Code Enforcement Officer shall transmit one copy of all
approved and denied applications to the Planning Board and one
copy of all approved applications to the Tax Assessor.

fees or other extraordinary expenses associated with the review of
a proposed site development plan shall be charged to the applicant
in accordance with the fee schedule specified in the application
documents.
(3) Performance guaranty. As an alternative to the installation of
required infrastructure and improvement, prior to approval by the
authorized board, a performance bond or other security sufficient
to cover the full cost of the same shall be furnished to the Village by
the owner. The sufficiency of such performance guaranty shall be
determined by the Village Board, after consultation with the Code
Enforcement Officer, Village Engineer, Planning Board and Village
Attorney. [Amended 2-19-2013 by L.L. No. 1-2013]
(4) Inspection of improvements and development. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall be responsible for the overall inspection
of site improvements, including coordination with the Village
Engineer and other officials and agencies, as appropriate. No
certificate of compliance shall be granted prior to a final inspection
and determination of conformity to the site development plan and
the New York State Uniform Code.
(5) Integration of site development plan approval procedure with other
Planning Board approvals. Whenever the particular circumstances
of a proposed development require compliance with either the
special use permit procedure or the requirements of the village's
land subdivision regulations,41 the Planning Board shall attempt to
integrate, as appropriate, site development plan review as required
by this section with the procedural and submission requirements
for such other compliances. In any case, all state permits and local
land use control approvals shall be procured prior to the issuance
of a building permit for a development project.

or determination the appeal is taken.
B. Use variances.
(1) The Board of Appeals, on appeal from the decision or determination
of the administrative officer charged with the enforcement of this
chapter, shall have the power to grant use variances, authorizing a
use of the land which otherwise would not be allowed or would be
prohibited by the terms of this chapter.
(2) No such use variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship, the applicant shall
demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that:
(a) Under the regulations of this chapter, the applicant is deprived
of all economic use or benefit from the property in question,
which deprivation shall be established by competent financial
evidence;
(b) The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the zone
district or neighborhood;
(c) The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
(d) The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of use variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate to
address the unnecessary hardship proven by the applicant and at
the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
C. Area variance.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an appeal
from a decision or determination of an administrative official
charged with the enforcement of this chapter, to grant area
variances from the area or dimensional requirements of this

(2) In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take
into consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety and
§ 163-24 WARSAW CODE § 163-24
1:334
§ 163-25. Appeals to Supreme Court.
welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In
making such determination, the Board shall also consider:
(a) Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
(b) Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved
by some method feasible for the applicant to pursue other than
an area variance;
(c) Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
(d) Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or
impact on the physical or environmental conditions in the
neighborhood or zone district; and
(e) Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board of
Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of the
area variance.
(3) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and adequate
and at the same time preserve and protect the character of the
neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
D. Imposition of conditions. The Board of Appeals shall, in the granting of
both use variances and area variances, have the authority to impose
such reasonable conditions and restrictions as are directly related to
and incidental to the proposed use of the property and/or the period of
time such variance shall be in effect. Such conditions shall be consistent
with the spirit and intent of this chapter and shall be imposed for the
purpose of minimizing any adverse impact that such variance may have
on the neighborhood or community.
E. A condition will be placed on each and every variance granted by the
Zoning Board of Appeals that all area variances and use variances shall
terminate one year after being granted unless all work and
requirements on the site have been completed in accordance with the
site development plan. [Added 2-19-2013 by L.L. No. 1-2013]

the Supreme Court for review by a proceeding under Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules. Such proceeding shall be instituted within

public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters.
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages.
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.
§ 163-39 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-40
1:363
(6) Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
B. Objectives. The objectives of this section are to:
(1) Protect human life and health.
(2) Minimize the expenditure of public money for costly flood-control
projects.
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public.
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets and bridges

development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood-blight areas.
(7) Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
C. General provisions.
(1) Lands to which this section applies. This section shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the Village of Warsaw.
(2) Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard are identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency as follows: (single panel) No. 360951 0003B,
dated November 18, 1981. This document is hereby adopted and
declared to be a part of this section. The Flood Insurance Study and
maps are on file at the Village Office, 15 South Main Street,
Warsaw, New York 14569.
(3) Interpretation; conflict with other laws.
(a) This section has been developed in response to revisions to the
National Flood Insurance Program through November 1, 1989,
and shall supersede all previous laws and ordinances adopted
for the purpose of establishing and maintaining eligibility for
flood insurance.
(b) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
section shall be held to be the minimum requirements, adopted
for the promotion of the public health, safety and welfare.
§ 163-40 WARSAW CODE § 163-40
1:364
Whenever the requirements of this section are at variance
with the requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules,
regulations or ordinances, the most restrictive or that
imposing the higher standards shall govern.
(4) Overlay district. The FP-O District shall not be independently
mapped upon the Zoning Map, but shall be mapped in conjunction
with an underlying district. The area within the FP-O District shall
be identical to the areas of special flood hazard within the Village of
Warsaw. The Zoning Map serves to provide a close approximation
of the special flood hazard area. The FIRM Maps and the Flood
Boundary and Floodway Map shall be used to determine the exact
legal boundaries of the special flood hazard area.
(5) Uses permitted; dimensional requirements. The uses permitted and
the dimensional requirements for the FP-O District shall be
determined by the regulations specified in this Article for the
primary or underlying zone district.
(6) Penalties for noncompliance. Penalties for noncompliance with
these regulations are specified in Article XIV of this chapter. Any
structure found not compliant with the requirements of this
chapter for which the developer and/or owner has not applied for
and received an approved variance under Subsection G will be
declared noncompliant and notification sent to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency.
(7) Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights
may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This section shall not create liability on the part of the
Village of Warsaw, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully
made thereunder.

flood elevation data is available (unnumbered A Zones)
shall be analyzed to determine the effects on the floodcarrying
capacity of the areas of special flood hazard set
forth in Subsection D(4)(a), Permit application review. This
may require the submission of additional technical data to
assist in the determination.
[2] In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood
elevation data is available pursuant to Subsection C(2) or
D(4)(b) and no floodway has been determined, the
cumulative effects of any proposed development, when
combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point.
[3] In all areas of the special flood hazard where floodway
data is provided or available pursuant to Subsection C(2),
the requirements of Subsection F, Floodways, shall apply.
[4] Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter,
certain development in Zones A1 through 30, AE and AH
may be permitted to increase the water surface elevation
of the base flood (e.g., dams, levees, etc.), provided that
the Village Board endorses an application to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the permit
application provides all necessary data and analyses and
pays all fees and FEMA approval is received.
§ 163-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-40
1:371
[5] The Code Enforcement Officer shall require within Zones
AH and AO adequate drainage paths around structures on
slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from

Subsection E(2)(b)[1], [2] or [3].
[5] Manufactured dwellings and recreational vehicles on-site
for longer than 180 consecutive days, with fully enclosed
areas below the lowest floor, must meet the requirements
of Subsection E(2)(a)[2].
(c) Nonresidential construction. In Zones A1 through 30, AE and
AH, new construction and substantial improvements of any
commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure,
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall
either have the lowest floor, including basement or cellar,
elevated to or above the base flood elevation or be floodproofed
so that the structure is watertight below the base flood level
with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water.
All structural components located below the base flood level
§ 163-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-40
1:373
must be capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
loads and the effects of buoyancy.
[1] In an AO Zone, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the lowest floor, including the
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at
least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the
FIRM [at least two feet if no depth number is specified].
[2] In an A Zone, when no base flood data is available, have
the lowest floor elevated at least three feet above the
highest adjacent grade.
[3] Within any AO Zone, have the lowest floor, including the
basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at
least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the
community's FIRM [at least two feet if no depth number is

[a] A licensed professional engineer or architect shall
develop and/or review structural design,
specifications and plans for the construction and shall
certify that the design and methods of construction
are in accordance with accepted standards of practice
§ 163-40 WARSAW CODE § 163-40
1:374
to make the structure watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water,
with structural components having the capability of
resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and
effects of buoyancy.
[b] A licensed professional engineer or licensed land
surveyor shall certify the specific elevation (in relation
to mean sea level) to which the structure is
floodproofed.
[7] The Code Enforcement Officer shall maintain on record a
copy of all such certificates noted in this subsection.
F. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas
designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying debris and posing additional
threats from potential erosion forces. When floodway data is available
for a particular site as provided by Subsections C(2) and D(4)(b), all
encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial
improvements and other development, shall be prohibited within the
limits of the floodway unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that
such encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels
during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
G. Variance procedure.
(1) Appeals Board.
(a) The Board of Appeals as established by the Village Board shall
hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this section.
(b) The Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the Code Enforcement Officer in the
enforcement or administration of this section.
(c) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article
78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
(d) In passing upon such applications, the Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other subsections of this section and:
[1] The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands
to the injury of others.
[2] The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
§ 163-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-40
1:375
[3] The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the
individual owner.
[4] The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
[5] The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
[6] The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
[7] The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
[8] The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program of that area.
[9] The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
[10] The costs to local governments and the dangers associated
with conducting search and rescue operations during
periods of flooding.
[11] The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of
wave action, if applicable, expected at the site.
[12] The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including search and rescue
operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems
and streets and bridges.
(e) Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection G(1)(d) above
and the purposes of this chapter, the Board of Appeals may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this section.
(f) The Code Enforcement Officer shall maintain the records of all
appeal actions, including technical information, and report any
variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
(2) Conditions for variances.
(a) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or
less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided
that the items in Subsection G(1)(d)[1] through [12] have been
§ 163-40 WARSAW CODE § 163-40
1:376
§ 163-41. PRD Planned Residential Development District.
fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance
would normally increase.
(b) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of
historic structures upon the determination that:
[1] The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure.
[2] The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the
historic character and design of the structure.
(c) Variances may be issued for new construction and substantial
improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
[1] The conditions specified in this Subsection G(2)(a), (d), (e)
and (f) are met.
[2] The structure or other development is protected by
methods that minimize flood damages during the base
flood and create no additional threat to public safety.
(d) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge
would result.
(e) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief.
(f) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written
justification of:
[1] A showing of good and sufficient cause.
[2] A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship to the applicant.
[3] A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety or extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or
conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(g) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice that the cost of flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from lowest
floor elevation.

A. Purpose. The PRD Planned Residential District has been designed to
encourage innovations in residential development so that desirable
residential living areas can be accomplished. This section recognizes
that while standard zoning changes are appropriate for the regulation
of land use in neighborhood areas that are already substantially
developed, these techniques represent a type of regulatory rigidity and
uniformity which will not permit the type of land development
envisioned in the PRD Planned Residential Development District. Thus,
where Planned Residential Development District techniques are
deemed appropriate through the rezoning of land to a Planned
Residential Development District by the Village Board, the set of use
and dimensional specifications specified herein in Schedule I53 shall be
replaced by the approval process in which an approved plan becomes
the basis for establishing land use controls.
B. Objectives. In order to carry out the intent of this section, the PRD
Planned Residential Development District shall be designed to achieve
the following objectives:
(1) The proposed residential development shall be in harmony with the
general purpose, goals and objectives of the Comprehensive Plan
and this chapter.
(2) The proposed residential development shall comply with all
applicable regulations of this chapter except as modified by the
authority of this section.
(3) The proposed residential development shall not have a substantial
adverse effect upon adjacent properties, utility facilities, traffic
conditions and other matters that would affect the public health,
safety and general welfare.
(4) The proposed residential development shall be constructed,
arranged and operated so as to not interfere with the development
and use of neighboring properties.
(5) The proposed residential development shall be adequately served
by essential public facilities and services, such as but not limited to
sanitary sewers, public water supply, stormwater drainage facilities
and highway capacity.
(6) The proposed residential development shall provide for the
effective development of the project site, making appropriate
provisions for the preservation of trees, streams, wetlands, natural
topography and geological features and the prevention of soil
erosion.
C. General requirements.
53.Editor's Note: Zoning Schedule I is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 163-41 WARSAW CODE § 163-41
1:378
(1) All types of residential uses are encouraged to be included in this
district, but are not necessarily required to obtain PRD zoning. In
order to develop a balanced community, the use of a variety of
housing types and densities shall be deemed to be consistent with
the objectives of this section.
(2) Accessory uses, such as private garages, storage buildings and
recreational and community activities, shall also be permitted as
appropriate to the PRD Planned Residential Development District.
(3) The PRD Planned Residential Development District shall be
applicable to any area in the village where the applicant can
demonstrate that the characteristics of the property proposed for
such use will meet the objectives of this section.
(4) The minimum area required to qualify for a PRD Planned
Residential Development District shall be 20 contiguous acres of
land. However, if an applicant can demonstrate that the
characteristics of the property proposed for such use can meet the
objectives of this section, projects with less acreage will be
considered.
(5) Where an applicant proposes the use of a portion of the site as
common property, satisfactory arrangements shall be made for the
improvement, operation and maintenance of such common
property and facilities. For the purpose of this section, the term
"common property" shall be defined as a parcel of land, together
with improvements thereon, the use and enjoyment of which is
shared by the owners and occupants of the PRD Planned
Residential Development District.
(6) Commercial, service or other nonresidential uses may be permitted
or required where such uses are scaled primarily to serve the
residents of the PRD Planned Residential Development District.
(7) The Village Board shall determine the appropriate dwelling unit
density for proposed PRD Planned Residential Development
Districts on an individual case basis.
(8) Individual buildings within a PRD Planned Residential
Development District shall be related to each other in design, mass,
materials, placement and connections to provide a visually and
physically integrated development.
(9) The treatment of all building facades within a PRD Planned
Residential Development District shall be comparable in amenity to
provide a visually and physically integrated development.
(10) Each dwelling unit shall be located, constructed and served by
utilities in such a manner that each dwelling unit may be sold
individually as a subdivision lot, condominium unit or in a similar
fashion as approved by the Village Board. Dwelling units located in
§ 163-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-41
1:379
a building common to other dwelling units shall be separated from
such dwelling units by a fire wall. Such fire wall shall extend from
the foundation to the roof and shall be unpierced.
(11) Utility lines providing electric, telephone, television or other
services shall be installed underground.
D. Application procedure.
(1) Application for the establishment of a PRD Planned Residential
Development District shall be made to the Village Board by filing an
application with the Village Clerk. The Village Board shall refer the
application to the Planning Board for consideration.
(2) In order for the Planning Board and the developer to reach an
understanding on basic design requirements, the developer shall
submit a plan describing the proposal to the Planning Board. Such
plan shall be to scale and shall be supplied in such form and
quantity as the Planning Board may require and shall include the
following information in addition to any other information which
the applicant deems necessary to support the application:
(a) The principal physical characteristics of the site, including an
analysis of the soils and subsoils and the location of major
physical features, including streams, floodplains, rock
outcroppings, major stands of trees, etc.
(b) The topography of the site with contour intervals of not more
than five feet of elevation; areas of the site where grades
exceed 3%; and portions of the site with a moderate to high
susceptibility to erosion, flooding or ponding.
(c) An analysis of the relationship of the site to the surrounding
community, including significant parcels of vacant land, and
the character of nearby built-up areas.
(d) Principal ties to the community at large with respect to
circulation, water supply, sewage disposal, drainage and other
pertinent public facilities and services.
(e) A general description of the relationship of the proposal to
other community facilities, such as schools, fire protection and
cultural facilities, if any, and some indication as to how these
needs are to be met.
(f) The proposed land use plan indicating the location, number
and types of dwelling units; parks, playgrounds, recreational
structures and facilities; open spaces; common property and
all other uses; and the circulation pattern with all existing
right-of-way and easements, parking areas and
pedestrianways.
§ 163-41 WARSAW CODE § 163-41
1:380
(g) A generalized grading and landscaping plan and plans for
stormwater drainage.
(h) If the development is to be staged, an indication of how the
staging is to proceed.
(i) Any other information deemed necessary by the Planning
Board to evaluate the consistency of the proposed PRD
Planned Residential Development with the purpose and
objectives of this section.
E. Review of development plan by Planning Board. The Planning Board
shall review the development plan and related documents and shall
provide a written report to the Village Board within 60 days of the date
following the receipt of a complete application. The Planning Board may
conduct a public hearing on the development plan to assist in the
preparation of its report. If the Planning Board does not submit a
written report to the Village Board within this sixty-day period, the
applicant may proceed on the basis that the Planning Board is in favor
of the proposed action. The Planning Board may, however, by official
action, extend this time period for an additional 60 days. The Village
Board shall be so informed as to the status of the review by the Planning
Board.
(1) A favorable report shall be based on the following findings which
shall be included as part of the report:
(a) The proposal implements the goals and policies of the village's
Comprehensive Plan more effectively than would the use of
conventional zoning techniques.
(b) The proposal meets all of the requirements of this section.
(c) The proposal represents a creative approach to the use of land
through innovation and flexibility.
(d) The proposal is conceptually sound in that it meets a
community need and that it conforms to accepted design
standards in the proposed roadway system, land use
configuration, open space system and drainage and utilities
systems.
(e) Adequate services and utilities are available or are proposed to
be made available to serve the development.
(2) An unfavorable report shall clearly state the reasons therefor and,
if appropriate, point out to the applicant what may be necessary to
receive a favorable report.
F. Application for Planned Residential Development District. Upon receipt
of a report from the Planning Board, the Village Board may consider the
application for a PRD Planned Residential Development District as it
would any other application for amendment to the Zoning Map and may
§ 163-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-41
1:381
establish a date for and conduct a public hearing for such an
amendment as provided by Village Law.
G. Zoning for PRD Planned Residential Development.
(1) If the Village Board approves the establishment of a PRD Planned
Residential Development District, the Zoning Map shall so be
amended. When rezoning land for such use, the Village Board shall
establish the maximum number and type of dwelling units therein
and may, if it feels it necessary in order to protect the public health,
safety and welfare of the community, attach to its zoning
resolutions any additional requirements for the applicant to meet.
Such requirements may include, but not be limited to, visual and
acoustical screening, land use mixes, order of construction and/or
occupancy, vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems,
availability of sites within the area for needed public services,
parks and open spaces and the protection of natural and/or historic
sites. Any application for the establishment of a PRD Planned
Residential Development District shall be subject to site
development plan review as provided in Article III of this chapter.
The Planning Board shall approve the final site development plan
prior to effectuation of the Zoning Map amendment and the
issuance of a building permit by the Code Enforcement Officer.
Such site development plan may constitute the entire development
or, if staged, only a portion thereof. If the project is to be
constructed in stages, only that portion receiving site development
plan approval may be effectuated.
(2) The fact that an application complies with all of the specific
requirements set forth herein shall not be deemed to create a
presumption that the proposed development would result in a more
efficient and desirable development than may be accomplished by
the use of conventional zoning categories or that it would ensure
compatibility with surrounding development; nor shall such
compliance, by itself, be sufficient to require the approval of the
development plan or the approval of the zoning amendment to
create a PRD Planned Residential Development District. Such
rezoning shall be recommended or rejected by the Planning Board
on a finding that the proposed action is or is not proper for the
comprehensive and systematic development of the Village of
Warsaw.

§ 163-43. Height regulations.
§ 163-44. Yard regulations.
A. A nonconforming zone lot of official record existing at the effective date
of this chapter may be used for any purpose permitted in the zone
district in which it is located, irrespective of its area or width, provided
that the owner of which does not own any adjoining property which
would create a conforming lot if all or part of said property were
combined with subject zone lot, and provided that the minimum area
for such lot shall be 12,000 square feet and have a minimum lot width of
80 feet within the R-1 Residential District and 8,000 square feet and 65
feet in width in the R-2 Residential District and that all other provisions
of this chapter are adhered to. No lot or lots in single ownership shall
hereafter be reduced so as to create one or more nonconforming lots.
B. A permit for the use of preexisting lots which are less than the minimum
area and lot width specified in Subsection A above may only be issued
following the approval of a variance by the Board of Appeals.
A. The height limitations of this chapter shall not apply to church spires,
belfries, cupolas, domes, silos and other buildings not used for human
occupancy.
B. Chimneys, ventilators, skylights, water tanks, freestanding towers,

ARTICLE IX
Nonconforming Uses and Structures
§ 163-46. Continuance.
Except as otherwise provided in this Article, the lawful use of land or
buildings existing at the date of the adoption of this chapter may be
continued although such use or building does not conform to the regulations
specified by this chapter for the zone district in which such land or building
is located. The following provisions shall, however, apply to all
nonconforming uses:
§ 163-47. Certification of nonconformance.
After the effective date of this chapter, upon the written request of the user
of any structure or premises or at the insistence of the Code Enforcement
Officer, an examination by the Code Enforcement Officer of any existing
use shall be made. A report of the findings made upon such examination
shall thereafter be filed with the Zoning Board of Appeals, together with a
certificate of existing nonconforming use, which shall clearly describe the
premises and structure, if any, referred to and shall specify the nature and
extent of such existing use. Such certificate shall be prepared in triplicate,
one copy of which shall be maintained by the Code Enforcement Officer, one
A. A nonconforming lot shall not be further reduced in size.
B. A nonconforming building shall not be enlarged, extended or increased
unless such enlargement would tend to reduce the degree of
nonconformance.
C. A nonconforming use shall not be expanded except as may be
authorized by § 163-48.
D. A nonconforming use may be changed into a conforming use. When a
nonconforming use is changed to conform to the requirements of this
chapter, the use of the building or tract of land shall not be changed
again except in accordance with these regulations.
E. Where such nonconforming use is upon the land itself and not enclosed
within a structure or where such use involves the removal of soil,
minerals or the excavation of gravel or rock or other material, such use
may be continued upon the land being so used at the time of the
adoption hereof. Any such nonconforming use of the land may be
extended or expanded to include any part of the plot or parcel of land
now being used or held in reserve for future use, provided that such
enlargement does not involve the use of any lot acquired or the
excavation rights of which were acquired by the excavation operator
after the effective date of this chapter. However, such extension or
expansion of such nonconforming use shall comply with the setback and
fencing requirements of this chapter.
§ 163-46 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-47
1:385
copy of which shall be furnished to the Zoning Board of Appeals and one
copy to be furnished to the owner or user.
§ 163-48. Expansion of nonconforming uses and/or structures.
A nonconforming use and/or structure shall not be expanded except in
conformance with the procedures and regulations specified in this section.
In no case shall such expansion extend beyond the lot occupied by such
nonconforming use or structure. The expansion of a nonconforming use
or structure hereunder shall be subject to approval by the Zoning Board
of Appeals, and each case shall be considered on an individual basis.
Application forms for the expansion of a nonconforming use and/or
structure shall be obtained from the Code Enforcement Officer. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall issue a permit to allow the expansion of a
preexisting nonconforming use and/or structure only upon written
authorization of the Zoning Board of Appeals. The Zoning Board of Appeals
in considering such special requests shall, at a minimum, address the
following potential concerns:
A. Standards applicable to authorizing the expansion of a nonconforming
use and/or structure:
(1) The location and size of the nonconforming use and/or structure,
the nature and intensity of the operations involved in or conducted
in connection with it, the size and site in relation to it, the location
of the site in relation to it and the location of the site with respect to
streets giving access thereto. Conditions shall be in place such that
the expansion will not be inconsistent with the orderly development
of the district in which the use is located.
(2) Screening or other protective measures shall be adequate to
protect any adjacent properties from objectionable aspects of any
such expansion of the nonconforming use.
(3) Off-street parking areas shall be of adequate size for the particular
use, and access drives shall be laid out so as to achieve maximum
safety and minimum inconvenience to adjacent properties.
(4) The Zoning Board of Appeals may prescribe any condition that it
deems necessary or desirable to aid it in making a determination on
the application and to protect the interests of the community and
adjacent properties.
B. Public hearing.
(1) Before authorizing the expansion of a nonconforming use and/or
structure, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall give public notice and
hold a public hearing on the application in the same manner as
required by law for amendments to the chapter.
(2) Prior to such public hearing, the application shall be referred to the
Village Planning Board for report and recommendation. The
§ 163-47 WARSAW CODE § 163-48
1:386
§ 163-49. Abandonment.
In any district, whenever a nonconforming use of land, premises, building or
structure or any part or portion thereof has been discontinued for a period
of one year, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be reestablished,
and all future uses shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter.
Such discontinuance of the active and continuous operation of such
nonconforming use or part or portion thereof for such period of one year
is hereby construed and considered to be an abandonment of such
nonconforming use, regardless of any reservation of an intent not to
abandon the same or of an intent to resume active operations. If actual
abandonment in fact is evidenced by the removal of buildings, structures,
machinery, equipment and other evidences of such nonconforming use of
the land and premises, the abandonment shall be construed and considered
to be completed and all rights to reestablish or continue such
nonconforming use shall thereupon terminate.
§ 163-50. Restoration.
Planning Board shall have 30 days after said referral to state its
position relative to the proposed application. The Zoning Board of
Appeals shall hold such public hearing at the earliest possible date
following the thirty-day referral period and may take action on the
proposal as it deems appropriate.
C. Limitations. An authorization to permit the expansion of a
nonconforming use and/or structure shall be deemed to authorize only
the particular use or structure specified in the application and shall
apply only to the area specified in the permit. A permit authorizing an
expansion under this section shall expire within six months from the
date of issuance if the nonconforming use and/or structure is not
expanded or enlarged.
A. Any building damaged by fire or other unintentional causes to the
extent of more than 50% of its true value shall not be repaired or rebuilt
except in conformance with this chapter. In the case of a permitted
restoration of a nonconforming use, such restoration shall not increase
the degree of nonconformance.
B. Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a
safe condition any wall or roof which has been declared unsafe by the
Code Enforcement Officer.
C. Normal maintenance repairs and incidental alteration of a building or
other structure containing a nonconforming use shall be permitted,
provided that it does not extend the area or volume of space occupied
by the nonconforming use.
D. Any building which is nonconforming due to insufficient yard distances
or lot area shall not be considered a nonconforming use. Any alterations
or structural changes may be accomplished within the existing frame of
§ 163-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 163-50
1:387
§ 163-51. District changes.
Whenever the boundaries of a district shall be changed so as to transfer an
area from one district to another of a different classification, the foregoing
provisions shall also apply to any nonconforming uses existing therein or
created thereby.
§ 163-52. Construction approval prior to adoption of regulations.
Nothing herein contained shall require any change in plans, construction or
designated use of a building or site complying with existing laws, a permit
for which had been duly granted before the date of adoption of this chapter
or any applicable amendment thereto.

Special Permit Uses
§ 163-53. Application; general standards.
A. The uses specified in this Article are hereby declared to possess unique
characteristics requiring that each proposal for any such use shall be
considered by the Planning Board as an individual case. Upon
application complying with the requirements of Article III, special use
permits may be approved by the Planning Board and issued by the Code
Enforcement Officer in accordance with the administrative procedures
set forth in Article III and only after it has found that each and all of the
following standards have been met:
(1) The proposed special use is consistent with the general intent of
the village's Master Plan and with each of the specific purposes set
forth in this chapter.
(2) The location, size and use of the structures involved, nature and
intensity of the operations involved and size and layout of the site in
relation to the proposed special use are such that it will be
compatible with the orderly development of the use district.
(3) The operation of the proposed special use is no more objectionable
to the uses of nearby properties, by reason of dust or smoke
emission, noise, odors, fumes, pollution of air or water, including
subsurface waters, unsightliness or similar conditions, than would
be the operation of any permitted use.
(4) The proposed special use satisfies each and all standards and
conditions specified for such special use by the relevant provisions
of this Article.
B. The Planning Board may impose additional conditions or restrictions as
it may deem necessary prior to approving any special use permit
application in order to protect public health and safety, the quality of
the village's natural resource base and the value of property. The Code
Enforcement Officer shall make an on-site visit to each property
authorized as a special use not less than one time each year. The
purpose of said site visit is to ensure that the use is being operated in
accord with the conditions specified by the Planning Board. If the Code
Enforcement Officer shall determine that a violation of this chapter or
the conditions imposed by the Planning Board exists, the certificate of
occupancy and/or certificate of compliance shall be null and void. A new
special use permit application shall be required to be submitted and
approved prior to the reestablishment of said use.
C. No site preparation or construction shall commence nor shall existing
structures be occupied for any special permit use until final site
development plan approval has been granted by the Planning Board
and permits have been issued by all governmental agencies involved.

Business, G-B General Business and L-I Light Industrial Districts, provided
that the following standards and conditions are maintained:
A. Essential services, as defined in § 163-10 herein, may be allowed as a
special permit use in any zone district upon the approval of a special
use permit by the Planning Board.
B. The Planning Board shall determine the following prior to approving a
special use permit:
(1) The proposed installation in a specific location is necessary and
convenient for the efficiency of the essential service or the
satisfactory and convenient provision of service to the area in
which the particular use is to be located.
(2) The design of any building in connection with such facility shall
conform to the neighborhood character of the area and will not
adversely affect the safe and comfortable enjoyment of property
rights in the district in which it is to be located.
(3) Adequate and attractive fences and other safety devices will be
provided.
(4) A buffer strip not less than 15 feet in depth shall be provided
around the perimeter of the property proposed for such use.
(5) Adequate off-street parking shall be provided.
(6) All other applicable requirements of this chapter shall be met.
A. In addition to the information required in the special permit application
and enumerated in § 163-19 herein, the site development plan
submitted shall also show the location and number of fuel tanks to be
installed, the dimensions and capacity of each storage tank, the depth
the tanks will be placed below the ground and the number and location
of fuel pumps to be installed.
B. Site development plans for such uses, including the location of tanks
and fire-suppression equipment, shall comply with the requirements of
the Uniform Code.
C. Such uses shall be screened from adjacent uses by a buffer area,
including screening and fencing to be determined by the Planning
Board, so as to prevent the transmission of headlight glare across the
property line. The Planning Board shall determine, on an individual
case basis, how close to the right-of-way the landscaped buffer shall be

§ 163-56. Public and semipublic uses and buildings. [Amended
6-26-2003 by L.L. No. 2-2003]
The Planning Board may approve a special use permit for public and
semipublic uses of an institutional, health, educational, recreational,
required to be installed. Such buffer screen shall have a minimum
height of six feet above the ground. If said shrubbery becomes decayed
and fails to provide an adequate screen, the Code Enforcement Officer
shall direct the property owner to replace said shrubs.
D. The entire area of the site traveled by motor vehicles shall be hard
surfaced and of asphalt or concrete construction.
E. All repairs of motor vehicles, except for minor servicing, shall be
performed in a fully enclosed building. No more than two partially
dismantled motor vehicles shall be stored outside of an enclosed
building at any one time.
F. Motor vehicle service stations may include facilities for the sale of food,
household items and convenience merchandise, provided that the sale
of such items takes place entirely within an enclosed building.
G. Accessory goods for sale may be displayed on the pump island and the

Therefore, it is recognized that the special regulation of these uses is
necessary to ensure the adverse effects will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of the surrounding neighbors, businesses or
land uses.

immediate peril to persons or property to be removed summarily upon
