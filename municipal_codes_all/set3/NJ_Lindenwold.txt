shall estimate the number of hours such law enforcement services are

the Construction Department for a continued certification of

determining that all provisions of the Code of the Borough of
Lindenwold have been complied with, shall issue a continued
certification of occupancy permitting occupancy of said

of a New Jersey licensed and insured home inspection company
to provide a report of the condition of the residential unit and
structures located on the property upon which the unit is
located, the report is dated within 60 days of closing date and

section, a contract purchaser of a residential unit(s) who, upon

certificate known as a "certificate of transfer of title," where
renovations to the residential premises are required to be
made so as to meet the standards for the issuance of a
certificate of continued occupancy. The application shall be
signed by the contract purchaser. The application for the
issuance of a certificate of transfer of title shall be made not
less than 10 days prior to the intended settlement date, as set
forth in the contract of sale. The contract purchaser shall
certify in writing on forms provided by the Construction
Department that they acknowledge the residential unit(s) are
not habitable and further that they will perform all necessary
repairs/remediations to meet the requirements set forth herein
for the issuance of a continued certificate of occupancy. Such
certificate of transfer of title shall be valid for a period of 120
days from the date of settlement on the property between
owner and contract purchaser. The purchaser/owner of the
premises may apply to extend the 120-day period to complete
the renovations, but such application shall be filed prior to the
expiration of the initial 120-day period. The Construction
Official may grant the extension; in his/her sole discretion, for
a period not to exceed 120 days provided the purchaser/owner
has commenced and is actively renovating the premises. Prior
§ 105-13.1 LINDENWOLD CODE § 105-13.1
1:122
to the expiration of the 120-day extension period, should the
repairs/remediation be substantially completed and upon
submitting proof necessary to the Construction Official that
unexpected/extraordinary circumstances occurred during the
renovations/remediation which prohibited the completion of
the same within the 120-day extension period, the
Construction Official may grant an additional thirty-day
extension in his/her sole discretion.
[1] Upon notification to the Construction Official and/or
designee that renovations have been completed, the
Construction Official and/or designee, shall inspect the
premises within 10 days of said notice. Upon finding that
all renovations have been completed and compliance with
this section has occurred, the Construction Official shall
then take appropriate action for the issuance of a
continued certification of occupancy in accordance with
Subsection B(1)(a) of this section. Provided no further
inspection is required and a continued certificate of
occupancy is issued, the fee for an inspection shall be
charged in accordance with Chapter 150, Fees.
(d) Should the property be deemed abandoned, vacant and/or a
nuisance as defined in Chapter 238, no certificate of transfer of
title shall be issued to any purchaser/owner unless the owner is
in compliance with Chapter 238 et seq. of the Code of the
Borough of Lindenwold.
(e) The owner or contract purchaser of any property subject to the
term hereof which is serviced by a private potable water well
shall submit to the Construction Official or designee copies of
the well test results required by N.J.S.A. 58:12A-26 prior to
closing of title.

occupancy shall be charged a fee as set forth in Chapter 150 of the
Code of the Borough of Lindenwold per unit and an owner making
application for a certificate of transfer of title shall be charged a fee as
set forth. A fee for all reinspections by the Construction Official shall

a continued certification of occupancy shall include the fee set forth in
Chapter 150 for the certificate of smoke detector inspection by the
designated official. Should an application be made for the issuance of a
continued certification of occupancy or certificate of transfer of title
less than 10 days before closing, the fee for the continued certification
of occupancy shall apply.

adopted herein as school property was owned by or leased to a school

approved herein to depict the location and boundaries of any property
which is, in fact, used for school purposes and which is owned by or

the absence of such depiction is the result of inadvertent omission or
the result of any changes in the location and boundaries of such
property which have not yet been incorporated into a revised approved
map, shall not be deemed to be an official finding and record that such
property is not owned by or leased to a school or school board or that
such property is not used for school purposes.
D. All the requirements set forth in P.L. 1988, c. 44, concerning the
preparation, approval and adoption of a Drug-Free School Zone Map

ARTICLE II
Development Fees
[Adopted 10-14-2009 by Ord. No. 1269; amended in its entirety
11-5-2014 by Ord. No. 2014-01]
§ 150-50. Purpose.
§ 150-51. Department approval.
§ 150-52. Definitions.
A. In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, § 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2) and the
Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1
through 40:55D-8.7), COAH is authorized to adopt and promulgate
regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review,
monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust
funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under
the jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and
have a COAH approved spending plan may retain fees collected from
nonresidential development.
C. Pursuant to the Executive Reorganization Act of 1969, P.L. 1969, c. 203
(N.J.S.A. 52:14C-1 et seq.), the Governor abolished COAH and
transferred all functions, powers, and duties to the Commissioner of the
Department of Community Affairs, effective August 29, 2011. Any and
all references to COAH shall mean the Department of Community
Affairs (the Department).
D. This article establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to the Department's
regulations and in accordance P.L. 2008, c. 46, §§ 8 and 32 through 38.
Fees collected pursuant to this article shall be used for the sole purpose
of providing low- and moderate-income housing. This article shall be
interpreted within the framework of the Department's rules on
development fees codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.
A. This article shall not be effective until approved by the Department
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1.
B. Borough of Lindenwold shall not spend development fees until the
Department has approved a plan for spending such fees in conformance
with N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3.
A. The following terms, as used in this article, shall have the following
meanings:
§ 150-50 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 150-52
1:179
§ 150-53. Residential development fees.
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  A development included
in the Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but is
not limited to, an inclusionary development, a municipal construction
project or a one-hundred-percent affordable development.
COAH or THE COUNCIL  The New Jersey Council on Affordable
Housing established under the Fair Housing Act which previously had
primary jurisdiction for the administration of housing obligations in
accordance with sound regional planning consideration in the state.
Pursuant to the Executive Reorganization Act of 1969, P.L. 1969, c.
203 (N.J.S.A. 52:14C-1 et seq.), the Governor abolished the Council and
transferred all functions, powers, and duties to the Commissioner of the
Department of Community Affairs, effective August 29, 2011. As such,
any and all references to COAH shall mean the Department.
DEVELOPER  The legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of
any land proposed to be included in a proposed development, including
the holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other person having
an enforceable proprietary interest in such land.
DEVELOPMENT FEE  Money paid by a developer for the
improvement of property as permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.3.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  The assessed value of a property
divided by the current average ratio of assessed to true value for
the municipality in which the property is situated, as determined in
accordance with §§ 1, 5 and 6 of P.L. 1973, c. 123 (N.J.S.A. 54:1-35a
through 54:1-35c).
GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES  Those strategies that minimize the
impact of development on the environment, and enhance the health,
safety and well-being of residents by producing durable, lowmaintenance,
resource-efficient housing while making optimum use of
existing infrastructure and community services.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all districts, residential developers, except for developers of
the types of development specifically exempted below, shall pay a
fee of 1 1/2% of the equalized assessed value for residential
development, provided no increased density is permitted.
(2) When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of 6% of the
equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
§ 150-52 LINDENWOLD CODE § 150-53
1:180
§ 150-54. Nonresidential development fees.68
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on
a site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1 1/2%
of the equalized assessed value on the first two units; and the
specified higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized assessed
value for the two additional units, provided zoning on the site has
not changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of
such a variance application.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development.
(1) Affordable housing developments, developments where the
developer is providing for the construction of affordable units
elsewhere in the municipality, and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
(2) Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Owner-occupied residential structures demolished and replaced as
a result of a fire, flood, or natural disaster shall be exempt from
paying a development fee.
(4) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
A. Imposed fees.
(1) Within all zoning districts, nonresidential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted, shall
pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value of the land
68.Note: It should be noted that pursuant to P.L. 2009, c. 90, and P.L. 2011, c. 122, the
nonresidential statewide development fee of 2.5% for nonresidential development is
suspended for all nonresidential projects that received preliminary or final site plan
approval subsequent to July 17, 2008, until July 1, 2013, provided that a permit for the
construction of the building has been issued prior to January 1, 2015.
§ 150-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 150-54
1:181
and improvements for all new nonresidential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from any
additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e., land
and improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the 2.5% development fee,
unless otherwise exempted below.
(2) The 2.5% fee shall not apply to an increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from alterations, change in use within existing
footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Nonresidential Development
Certification/Exemption" Form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies, and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by Lindenwold Borough as a lien against the real property of the
owner.
§ 150-54 LINDENWOLD CODE § 150-55
1:182
§ 150-55. Lindenwold Borough collection procedures.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval,
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
staff to notify the construction official responsible for the issuance of a

Nuisance Properties
[Adopted 10-14-2016 by Ord. No. 2015-16]
§ 160-49. Statutory authority.
§ 160-50. Findings and purpose.
A. N.J.S.A. 55:19-82 sets forth the criteria for determining a property to be
a nuisance. A public officer who determines a property to be a nuisance
pursuant to this statute shall follow the due process requirements set
forth in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3 et seq. which are also set forth in detail in this
article.
B. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2 provides, in relevant part, that a municipality may
make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances to protect the public
health, safety and welfare. This statute is an express delegation of
police power to a municipality.
C. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.5 preserves the power of municipalities to define and
declare nuisances and to cause their abatement or removal by summary
proceedings in accordance with the due process requirements set forth
in N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3 through 40:48-2.12. The right of summary action to
abate or remove public nuisances also exists at common law.
D. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12a provides, in relevant part, that a governing body of
a municipality may make, amend, repeal and enforce ordinances to
regulate buildings and structures and their use and occupation to
prevent and abate conditions therein harmful to the health and safety of
the occupants of said buildings and structures and the general public in
the municipality.
E. N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.12n acknowledges a growing problem with rental
properties in many municipalities in the state. The Legislature found
and declared that municipal residents have experienced disturbances,
damage and public expense resulting from carelessly granted and
inadequately supervised rentals to irresponsible tenants by inept or
indifferent landlords.
A. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that there
are properties located within the community that constitute a nuisance
which require the abatement or removal of the nuisance by summary
proceedings.
B. Nuisance properties create a wide range of problems for a municipality
in which they are located. These properties foster criminal activity,
create public health problems and otherwise diminish the quality of life
for residents and business operators in those areas where the nuisance
properties are located.
§ 160-49 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 160-50
1:213
C. Nuisance properties also diminish the property values of neighboring
properties, increase the risk of property damage through arson and
vandalism and discourage neighborhood stability and revitalization.
D. The continued presence of nuisance properties in the municipality acts
as a significant barrier to community revitalization and to the
regeneration of the urban centers.
E. The responsibility of a property owner to supervise his or her property
and monitor the activities of tenants to prevent it from becoming a
nuisance to others extends to properties which are in use. The failure of
an owner to comply with legitimate orders to abate or remove the
nuisance creates a presumption that the owner has abandoned his or
her responsibility to maintain the property free and clear of public
nuisances.
F. The responsibility of a property owner to maintain a property in sound
condition to prevent it from becoming a nuisance to others also extends
to properties which are not in use and in a state of deterioration by
neglect. The failure of an owner to comply with legitimate orders to
demolish, repair or otherwise stabilize his or her property creates a
presumption that the owner has abandoned his or her responsibility to
maintain the property free and clear of public nuisances.
G. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations to identify these
nuisance properties and provide for the timely abatement or removal of
the nuisance through summary proceedings.

ARTICLE I
Introduction
§ 164-1. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety and general welfare
of its citizenry.
§ 164-2. Findings of fact.
§ 164-3. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Lindenwold are subject to
periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health
and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. To protect human life and health;
B. To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) of this section have been fully
considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

to determine the amount of the performance guaranty. Said performance
guaranty shall have been reviewed and have the approval of the Borough
Solicitor as to both form and amount prior to the issuance of any permits.
§ 190-32. Amending an approved site plan.
An application for the amending of an approved site plan may be made

for a different use of the property as defined in this article. Applications
for amendments to approved site plans shall adhere to the following
procedures:

eligible to receive a building permit from the Building Inspector until
such time as a site plan is submitted which is revised to comply with the

from the date upon which site plan approval was granted by the Joint Land
Use Board. Failure of the applicant to complete construction within such
period shall nullify and void the site plan approval granted for the premises
as if no site plan approval had ever been granted for the plans, and said
applicant will be in violation of this chapter if any construction or excavation
is undertaken or continued after the expiration date of the two-year period
from the date of approval. The Joint Land Use Board may, upon good cause
shown, extend the period specified above for a reasonable period of time in
order to avoid undue hardship and unfairness.

The Joint Land Use Board, when acting upon applications for preliminary
site plan approval, shall have the power to grant such exceptions from
the requirements for site plan approval as may be reasonable and within

approval of this chapter if the literal enforcement of one or more provisions
of this chapter is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of
peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question.
§ 190-35. Simultaneous review of uses, site plans and subdivisions.
The Joint Land Use Board shall have the power to review and approve
or deny conditional uses or site plans simultaneously with review for
subdivision approval without the developer being required to make further
application to the Joint Land Use Board or the Joint Land Use Board being
required to hold further hearings. The longest time period for action by
the Joint Land Use Board, whether it be for subdivision, conditional use or
site plan approval, shall apply. Whenever approval of a conditional use is
requested by the developer pursuant to this section, notice of the hearing
on the plat shall include reference to the request for such conditional use.
§ 190-36. Effect of final approval of site plan.
A. The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval first
granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer pursuant to
this article, whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed

developer has followed the standards prescribed for final approval, the
Joint Land Use Board may extend such period of protection for
extensions of one year but not to exceed three extensions.

Borough Council for a period not to exceed two years after final
acceptance of the improvement in an amount not to exceed 15% of
the cost of the improvement.
B. The Borough Engineer shall review the improvements required by the
approving authority which are to be bonded and itemize their cost. Said
itemization shall be the basis for determining the amount of
performance guaranty and maintenance guaranty required by the
approving authority. The Borough Engineer shall forward his estimate
of the cost of improvements to the applicant within 30 days of the date
of receipt of a request sent by certified mail for said estimate.
C. In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities
automatically will own the utilities to be installed or the improvements
are covered by a performance or maintenance guaranty to another
governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guaranty, as the
case may be, shall be required for such utilities or improvements.

§ 190-39. Reduction of guaranty amount; time for installation.
The amount of any performance guaranty may be reduced by the Borough
Council by resolution when portions of the improvements have been
certified by the Borough Engineer to have been completed. The time
allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance
guaranty has been provided may be established by the Borough by
resolution.
§ 190-40. Improvements not completed or corrected.
If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in accordance
with the performance guaranty, the obligor and surety, if any, shall be liable
thereon to the Borough for the reasonable cost of the improvements not
completed or corrected, and the Borough may, either prior to or after the

Engineer shall inspect all of the improvements and shall file a detailed
report, in writing, with the Borough Council, indicating either approval,
partial approval or rejection of the improvements, with a statement of
reasons for any rejection. If partial approval is indicated, the cost of the
improvements rejected shall be set forth.

The Borough Council shall either approve, partially approve or reject the
improvements on the basis of the report of the Borough Engineer and shall
notify the obligor in writing, by certified mail, of the contents of said report
and the action of said approving authority with relation thereto not later
than 65 days after receipt of the notice from the obligor of the completion
of the improvements. Where partial approval is granted, the obligor shall be
released from all liability pursuant to its performance guaranty except for
the improvements not yet approved. Failure of the Borough Council to send
or provide such notification to the obligor within 65 days shall be deemed to
constitute approval of the improvements, and the obligor and surety, if any,
shall be released from all liability pursuant to such performance guaranty.
§ 190-43. Correction or completion of rejected improvements.
If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving
authority may require the obligor to complete such improvements, and upon
completion the same procedure of notification as set forth in this article

H. Grades above 8% at intersections will be allowed if environmental
factors justify it. At the intersection of any street and a collector street,
grades shall not exceed 5%. [Amended 10-15-1979 by Ord. No. 529]
I. Street intersection angles. The intersection of two local residential
streets shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible and in no case
shall be less than 60°. The intersection of a local residential street with
a residential collector street shall be as nearly at right angles as is
possible and in no case shall be less than 85°. The intersection of a
residential street with another residential collector street shall not be
less than 90°. The block corners at intersections shall be rounded at the
curbline with a curve having a radius of not less than 25 feet.
J. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
prohibited.
K. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
L. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any point by
more than 10° and not more than 45°, they shall be connected by a
curve with a radius of not less than 100 feet for minor streets and 300
feet for arterial and collector streets, measured along the center line.
When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any point by
more than 45°, they shall be connected by a curve with a radius of not
less than 500 feet, measured along the center line.
M. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of sufficient
radius to provide a smooth transition and proper sight distance as
determined by the Borough Engineer.
N. Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac) shall not be longer than 600 feet and
shall provide a turnaround at the end with a radius of 50 feet to the
outside edge of the cartway and 60 feet to the outside edge of the rightof-
way and tangent whenever possible to the right side of the street.
The length of the cul-de-sac shall be measured along its center line from
its intersection with the intersecting street's center line to the center of
the radius of the cul-de-sac. If a dead end is of a temporary nature, a
similar turnaround shall be provided and provisions made for future
extension of the street and reversion of the excess right-of-way to the
adjoining properties.
O. No street shall have a name which will duplicate or so nearly duplicate
as to be confused with the names of existing streets. The continuation
of an existing street shall have the same name. All street names shall be
checked against the Borough master file of street names.
P. Subdivisions shall be so designed as to minimize the total area of the
subdivision devoted to street right-of-way.
Q. The access road and the area on each side thereof for a distance of 10
feet on each side of the pavement of said road and for a height of 16 feet
§ 190-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-48
1:285
six inches from the surface of the road shall be kept free and clear
of tree limbs, vines and other obstructions to permit free and
unobstructed use of said access road by emergency vehicles.
R. In general, continuous longitudinal downgrades shall not be run for
more than 1,000 feet. Where the general ground slope makes longer
runs desirable, such run shall be broken by a short upgrade of sufficient
length to create a low point at least six inches in depth. Double inlets
shall be located at the low point.
S. Pavement thickness design.
(1) The pavement thickness design shall, as a minimum, conform to the
following schedule:

Marginal access 2 5
Parking lots
Automobile 2 6, quarry blend stone
Truck 2 5
(2) In lieu of the requirements of Subsection S(1), flexible roadway
pavements may be designed using the procedures established in
the publication entitled "Thickness Design  Full Depth Asphalt
Pavement Structures for Highways and Streets," Manual Series No.
1 (MS-1), published by the Asphalt Institute, or by using the
Structural Number System, which is taken from the Pennsylvania
Department of Transportation Design Manual.
T. Four-way intersections. Four-way intersections connecting a local
residential street with another local residential street or with
residential collector streets shall be prohibited.
U. Half streets. New half or partial streets shall not be permitted.
Wherever a proposed subdivision borders an existing undeveloped
street, the Joint Land Use Board may require that at least one lane of
the other part of the street be constructed if it is found that such a
requirement will increase or improve the effect of the traffic circulation
system in the area. Full-width construction may be required depending
on size or development existing or anticipated traffic congestion and/or
the general conditions of the area.
V. Multiple intersections. Multiple intersections involving a junction of
more than two streets shall be prohibited.
§ 190-48 LINDENWOLD CODE § 190-48
1:286
§ 190-49. Lots.
W. Intersections with arterial streets. To the fullest extent possible, local
residential streets and residential collector streets shall not intersect
with arterial streets less than 800 feet apart, measured from the center
line.
A. General. The lot size, width, depth, shape and orientation and the
minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of
the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated.
B. Lot dimensions. Lot dimensions shall conform to the requirements of
Chapter 365, Zoning, and lots abutting major and collector streets shall
exceed the minimum depth requirements where necessary to increase
the safety and privacy thereon.
C. Access. Each lot shall front on an approved street.
D. Street widening. Where extra width has been dedicated for widening of
existing streets, lots shall begin at such extra-width line and all
setbacks shall be measured from such line.
E. Side lot lines. Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be at right
angles to straight streets and radial to curved streets.
F. Double frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be
avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential
development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages
of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least
10 feet shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic
artery or other disadvantageous condition. There shall be no right of
access across such easement.
G. Off-street parking. Where no garage is erected on a lot to be used for
the building of housing accommodations, a hard-surfaced driveway
shall be constructed from the street line to the building line in order to
provide off-street parking.
H. Odd-shaped lots. Where there is a question as to the shape and
boundary line of a lot or lots for their optimum use by future occupants,
including such conditions as narrow or unduly elongated lots and other
awkward appearing angles or appendages, the Joint Land Use Board
may withhold approval of such lot or lots.
I. Extra lot depth. Residential lots fronting on arterial streets, lots having
reverse frontage on arterial streets, and lots backing on streams shall
be provided with 30 feet of extra depth.
J. Lots backing on railroads. Lots backing on a railroad right-of-way shall
have additional depth equal to not less than 25%. In the interest of
maintaining the safety and welfare of future residents of the lots
backing on a railroad, a protective fence and landscaped buffer screen
§ 190-48 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-49
1:287
§ 190-50. Blocks.
shall be erected by the subdivider, the type and location of which shall
be subject to the approval of the Joint Land Use Board.
A. General. Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall
be such as to accommodate the size of lot required by this chapter and
to provide for convenient access, circulation control and safety of street
traffic. For commercial, group housing or industrial use, block size shall
be sufficient to meet all area and yard requirements for such use.
B. Block lengths.
(1) It is recognized that setting minimum and maximum block length
standards must be related to sound planning principles and to the
varying densities and lot widths specified in Chapter 365, Zoning.
To provide for this needed flexibility, the minimum and maximum
length of a block shall be governed by the minimum and maximum
number of lots specified in each lot width category in the following
schedule:
Schedule of Minimum and Maximum Block Length
Standards
Lot Width
Categories Number of Lots
(feet)
Minimum Maximum
Recommended
Standard
A 100 or less 5 15 10 to 12
B 101 to 120 5 14 10 to 12
C 121 to 160 4 12 8 to 10
D 161 to 200 or
more
3 10 6 to 8
(2) A block shall fit into a specific lot-width category when the widths
of not less than 75% of the lots measured at the front building
setback line fall within a specific ten-foot lot frontage category.
(3) Block lengths shall fall within the minimum and maximum required
standards; however, a developer should take notice of the
recommended standard for block lengths. This recommended
standard is set forth as an ideal standard for the majority of the
blocks in the proposed subdivision. Some deviation from this
recommended standard, however, is considered desirable in the
interests of variety and good subdivision design.
C. Block-end planting. In cases where lot and block design results in
undesirable sighting down rear property lines from block ends, a
landscape screen not less than eight feet in height shall be provided at
block ends by the developer.
§ 190-49 LINDENWOLD CODE § 190-51
1:288
§ 190-51. Easements.
§ 190-52. Public sites and recreation facilities.
A. General. An easement shall be provided for all natural drainageways
and all utility lines when such utility line or lines do not fall within a
dedicated right-of-way. All easements shall be plotted on a preliminary
and final plat. A clause shall be inserted in the deed of each lot affected
by an easement, specifically reserving the easement.
B. Minimum easement width. Except as further required by this article,
easements shall have a minimum width of 15 feet.
C. Pedestrian walkways. Interior pedestrian walkways may be required by
the Joint Land Use Board where necessary to assist pedestrian
circulation. Such walkways shall have a right-of-way width of not less
than 15 feet and a paved sidewalk not less than four feet in width. A
fence of a height and type to be specified shall be provided along both
sides of the easement. Adjoining lots next to the walkway easements
shall be increased in width from the center of the easements an amount
equal to 1/2 of the required pedestrian walkway easement.
D. Drainageways. Where a subdivision is traversed by a drainageway,
channel or stream, a drainageway easement conforming substantially
with the lines of such watercourse shall be provided. The easement
shall be a minimum of 20 feet wide or such width as will be adequate to
preserve natural drainage and provide sufficient width for
maintenance. Where it is found that additional easement width is
needed, such width shall be determined by the Joint Land Use Board in
consultation with the Borough Engineer.
E. Easement location. To the fullest extent possible, easements shall be
centered on or adjacent to rear or side lot lines.
F. Easements and lot sizes. In specific cases where lots front or side on
easements, the Joint Land Use Board, upon recommendation of the
Borough Engineer, may require the depth or width of said affected lots
to be increased by the width of the easement. This determination shall
take into consideration the health, safety and welfare of the future
residents of said lots as well as the usefulness of the lots by the future
residents as a result of the easement.
G. Street shade tree easement. A five-foot easement running parallel and
contiguous to all street or highway rights-of-way shall be deeded to the
Borough, granting the Borough the exclusive right to protect, plant,
prune, spray, remove, control, regulate and improve shrubbery and
shade trees thereon. In new development where a shade tree easement
has been provided, no plantings will be permitted within the street
right-of-way.
A. Where a park, playground, school or other site for public use is
proposed in whole or in part in the applicant's subdivision, the Joint

service facility installations shall be installed underground in
accordance with the requirements and tariffs of the serving
organizations.
B. The subdivider shall contact the electric, telephone and any other
service facility organization as early as practicable about supplying
underground facilities to the proposed new subdivision.
A. Existing trees. To the fullest extent possible, existing trees shall be
preserved by the developer. Special consideration shall be given to the
layout of lots and the position of dwellings on the lots to ensure that
existing trees are preserved. Special precautions shall also be taken to
protect existing trees during the process of grading lots and roads.
Where any land other than streets is to be dedicated to public use, the
developer shall not remove any trees or topsoil from the site or change
the site in any way without written permission from the Joint Land Use
Board.118
B. Watercourses. Where a subdivision is traversed by a natural lake, pond
or stream, the boundaries or alignment of said watercourse shall be
preserved and shall conform substantially to the natural alignment or
boundary. Where required, the developer shall be responsible for and
shall bond for such stream improvements as deemed necessary by the
Borough Engineer.
C. Unique physical features. Unique physical features such as historic
landmarks, rock outcroppings, hilltop lookouts and similar features
shall be preserved if possible. The Joint Land Use Board may, after
proper investigation, withhold approval of the lotting of such area or
areas.

(1) Computations of the rate of flow at any given location shall be
based on the following Rational Formula:
Q = CIA
In which:
Q = Volume in cubic feet per second
C = Runoff factor
I = Intensity of rainfall in inches per hour
A = Watershed area in acres
(2) In setting the value of the runoff coefficient C, consideration will be
given to the physical features of the drainage basin and the best
available data on the future density of development of the drainage
basin.

(4) Standard headwalls shall be installed on all pipes.
C. Pipeline design.
120. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 190-59 LINDENWOLD CODE § 190-59
1:292
(1) Storm sewer pipelines shall be designed by the following method
and shall be based on the Manning equation and shall utilize the
following friction factors:
n = 0.105 Concrete pipe
n = 0.021 Corrugated metal pipe
(2) The minimum allowable pipe size is 15 inches. Reinforced concrete
Class III shall be used in pavement areas and wherever there is
vehicular traffic, unless otherwise designated by the Borough
Engineer. Where the cover on the pipe will be less than two feet,
reinforced concrete pipe Class IV shall be used.
(3) This method is based on the assumption that hydraulic gradient will
match the inside top of the pipe when system is under maximum
hydraulic load.
(4) For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets, etc., shall be
ignored.
(5) The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum
velocity of 2.5 feet per second shall be maintained when the pipe is
flowing at 1/4 full.
(6) When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes shall be
matched.
(7) Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe shall be plotted, along
with the location of the hydraulic gradient, and the hydraulic
information shall include the pipe size and type, the "n" factor, the
slope of the hydraulic gradient, slope of the pipe, the design
capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
D. Inlet design.
(1) Stormwater inlets shall be equal to New Jersey State Highway
Department inlet Type B. The maximum collecting capacities of the
inlets shall be considered to be:
(a) When installed on streets where the grade is 0.75%, five cubic
feet per second.
(b) When installed on streets where the grade is 2%, 4.8 cubic feet
per second.
(c) When installed on streets where the grade is 3%, 4.6 cubic feet
per second.
(d) When installed on streets where the grade is 4%, 4.4 cubic feet
per second.
(e) When installed on streets where the grade is 5%, 4.2 cubic feet
per second.
§ 190-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-59
1:293
(f) When installed on streets where the grade is 6%, four cubic
feet per second.
(2) Sufficient inlets shall be located and constructed so that the length
of surface runoff will not contribute a runoff to the inlet exceeding
the preceding designated collecting capacities. In no case shall the
distance between inlets be greater than 400 feet.
(3) The gutter grate of all inlets shall be set not more than two inches
below the gutter grade. The surface of the paving adjacent to the
inlets shall be constructed to blend into the lowered gutter grade at
the inlet in such a manner that a sudden dropoff or dip at the inlet
will not be created. At such locations where drainage is entirely
dependent on inlets, the collecting capacities of the inlets shall be
designed for 1/2 the preceding considered capacities.
(4) Where surface water is collected from two directions at one street
corner, inlets shall be placed at or near the tangent points of both
ends of the radius. The use of one inlet in the radius shall not be
allowed.
(5) Access manholes shall be spaced at maximum intervals of 400 feet
through rights-of-way and at sewer junctions where there are no
catch basins.
E. Open channel design.
(1) Open ditches or channels will not be permitted when the design
capacity requires a fifteen-inch pipe or larger, unless approved by
the Borough Engineer. Where permitted, open-channel design
should be based on the following hydraulic considerations:
(a) Manning's equation.
n = 0.015 Best concrete-lined ditch
n = 0.025 Best unlined ditch
n = 0.03 to 0.15 Fair to poor natural streams and
watercourses
(b) Allowable velocity.
Excavation Material
Velocity
(feet per second)
Fine sand and firm loam 2.5 to 3.5

1:294
§ 190-60. Streetlighting.
(3) The channel should be designed to conform wherever possible to
the adjacent ground conditions. This means that it should not be
projecting excessively above the surrounding ground.
(4) Continuous profiles for each reach of open channel shall be plotted
along with adjacent average ground and the hydraulic information
pertinent to each reach within the system. This information shall
include the type of channel lining, the "n" factor, the width of the
channel bottom, the side slopes, the water depth, the design
capacity and the velocity at the design capacity.
(5) Open channels shall have a maximum side slope of 3:1 and shall
have adequate slope protection as required by Chapter 273, Soil
Removal, of the Code of the Borough of Lindenwold.
F. Culverts. All culverts shall be limited to a single opening. Multiple pipes
will not be permitted. The design of culverts shall be such as to
minimize the probability of debris accumulation.
G. Detention basin design. Detention ponds will be required in all major
developments and site plans unless deemed unnecessary by the
Borough Engineer. Detention ponds shall be designed to limit the
stormwater runoff to a controlled rate of flow equal to or less than the
stormwater runoff prior to development. The required storage in the
basin should be for a twenty-five-year storm, with the outflow from the
basin limited to a ten-year storm. Complete calculations for the basin
should be supplied at the time the preliminary plan or final site plan is
submitted. These calculations should include runoff prior to
development, runoff after development and complete calculations for
design.
A. Streetlighting shall be installed by the subdivider in locations approved
by the Borough Engineer, in accordance with the Borough's
streetlighting policy. All future site improvements in the right-of-way of
Berlin Road shall be constructed in conformance with the proposed
Berlin Road Streetscape Project, with particular attention to the
installation of lighting. [Amended 10-12-2011 by Ord. No. 1293]
B. For normal street usage, thirty-foot-high laminated poles shall be
spaced at a minimum distance of 150 feet, with one-hundred-watt
mercury vapor luminaires.

utility or other companies providing such services.
§ 190-62. Underdrains.
§ 190-63. Topsoil protection.
No topsoil shall be removed from the site or used as spoil. Topsoil moved
during the course of construction shall be redistributed so as to provide at
least six inches of cover to all areas of the subdivision and shall be stabilized
by seeding or planting. Under no circumstances shall any soil or earth be
sold or otherwise removed from the site unless application is made and
approval granted therefor under Chapter 273, Soil Removal, of the Code of
the Borough of Lindenwold.
§ 190-64. Natural features.
Natural features such as trees, brooks, hilltops and views shall be preserved
whenever possible in designing any subdivision containing such features.
E. The Borough will assume the operating expense for streetlights in a
particular section when 75% of that section is occupied.
A. Underdrains shall be provided throughout all of the developments to
carry water by gravity from below all basement floors to storm drains or
other proper places of disposal. Where perimeter underdrains are
provided, they shall be connected into a sump pit (approved by the
Borough Engineer) and discharge to a storm drainage system or shall
be tied into a separate underdrain system. In no case shall perimeter
underdrains be tied into the underdrain beneath the sanitary sewers.
B. Where sump pumps are used on individual lots, they shall discharge
into a pipe which shall run from the structure to the underdrain in the
street. A sump pump may only be used to supplement the underdrain
system around the structure. No underdrains in streets shall be less
than six inches in diameter. The size of the underdrains shall be
increased not less than 10% in cross-sectional area for each 1,000 feet
of longitudinal drain. Cleanouts shall be provided at all changes in line
or grade; however, the distance between cleanouts shall not exceed 400
feet. In no case shall cleanouts be permitted in sanitary manholes. One
cleanout with a brass cap shall also be provided in each basement floor
in drain to the underdrain in the street. Underdrains in the street shall
be separated from the sanitary sewer by a horizontal and vertical
distance of at least one foot.121

B. Methods of construction.
(1) Subgrade. Before construction of the pavement, the subgrade shall
be in a properly finished condition conforming to the proper line
and grade and free of any soft spots or other deficiencies. Not more
than 24 hours prior to commencing of operations on any subgrade,
the subgrade shall be tested by running a roller of a weight at least
equal to that to be used in the paving operation over the entire
subgrade area. When permitted by the Engineer, testing may be
performed by other equipment, such as loaded trucks. When in the
opinion of the Engineer or his representative the deformation of the
subgrade under such tests is excessive, the subdivider will be
required to stabilize the subgrade in a manner satisfactory to the
Engineer. The subgrade shall not be prepared during freezing

five or more samples representing continuous areas of pavement
shall be not less than five inches or six inches, and the minimum
thickness permitted at any location will be 4 1/2 inches or 5 1/2
inches. The deficiency shall be made up by increasing the thickness
of the surface course.
(3) Surface course. Prior to placing of the surface course, the
contractor shall repair any defects in the base course. Where
cracking or any other type of failure has occurred in the base
course, the contractor shall completely remove the base course,
stabilize the subgrade if necessary and construct new base course.
Where the deficiency involves depressions or raveling in the
surface of the base course, the repair may be made by skin
patching with a suitable bituminous material.
C. For checking of gutter drainage, the subdivider shall supply sufficient
water at the high points of the streets and shall run said water into the

§ 238-5. Responsibilities of owners; Borough to remedy uncorrected
emergency situation.
A. When in the opinion of the construction official, or in their absence the
designate of the construction official, there exists an emergency
situation concerning the condition of a property which represents an
immediate threat to the public safety, health or welfare, or in the
opinion of the construction official, a building or structure is dangerous
to human life or constitutes a fire hazard, requiring immediate action to
avoid and mitigate the emergency situation, immediate notice, if
practicable, shall be given to the property owner requesting that the
situation be remedied. The construction official shall attempt to contact
the property owner via telephone, fax, or email concerning the
emergency situation, and the owner shall be provided 24 hours within
which to rectify and remediate the emergency situation. In the event
the construction official is unable to make contact with the property
owner, or the property owner otherwise fails to respond within the
twenty-four-hour period, the Borough may take all actions necessary
and appropriate to remedy the situation, including but not limited to
demolition of the property.
B. In addition to assessing the cost of any such removal or demolition as a
municipal lien against the premises, the Borough may enforce the
payment of such assessment, together with interest, as a debt of the
owner of the premises and may authorize the institution of an action at
law for the collection thereof. The Superior Court shall have jurisdiction
over any such action.

of the notice or process on the authorized agent. Any owner who has
designated an authorized agent under the provisions of this section
shall be deemed to consent to the continuation of the agent's
designation for the purposes of this section until the owner notifies the
Construction Official or his designee of a change of authorized agent or
until the owner files a new annual registration statement. The
designation of an authorized agent in no way releases the owner from
any requirement of this article.152

days, to the municipal clerk of the municipality wherein the property is

F. N.J.S.A. 55:19-100 provides in relevant part that with respect to any lien

property if an individual, against any asset of any partner if a
partnership, and against any asset of any owner of a ten-percent
interest or greater if the owner is any other business organization entity
recognized pursuant to law.
A. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that
residential properties with pending foreclosure proceedings typically
become vacant. These vacant properties if not maintained rapidly
become eyesores with unkempt lawns and overgrown vegetation,
broken doors and windows, and deteriorating structures. These
properties create a wide range of negative secondary effects in the
neighborhoods where they are located in that they foster criminal
activity, create public health problems, and otherwise diminish the
quality of life for residents and business operators located in those
areas.
B. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that
residential properties with pending foreclosure proceedings which have
become vacant typically are not maintained by the creditor who has
filed the foreclosure proceedings. These vacant properties deteriorate
by neglect and diminish property values of neighboring properties,
increase the risk of property damage through arson and vandalism, and
discourage neighborhood stability and revitalization.
C. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that there
are vacant residential properties located within the community that
constitute a nuisance which require the abatement or removal of the
nuisance by summary proceedings. Where a creditor has filed a
summons and complaint for the foreclosure of a mortgage on a

meanings unless the context clearly indicates that a different meaning is
intended. Any words not defined herein shall have the meaning given in
Webster's Unabridged Dictionary.

occupied or at which substantially all lawful construction, operation, or
occupancy has ceased; provided, however, that any property that contains
all building systems in working order, is fully compliant with property
maintenance codes, and is being actively marketed by its owner for sale or
rental shall not be deemed vacant. Property determined to be "abandoned
property" in accordance with the meaning of such term in the Abandoned
residential property that is vacant, the creditor is responsible for the
abatement or removal of the nuisance.
D. The governing body of the municipality finds and declares that there
are vacant residential properties located within the community that
have violations of the Property Maintenance Code which require
affirmative action to correct the violation to protect the public health,
safety and welfare. Where a creditor has filed a summons and complaint
for the foreclosure of a mortgage on a residential property that is
vacant, the creditor is responsible for the correction of the violation of
the Property Maintenance Code.
E. It is the purpose and intent of these regulations to require the
registration of residential properties where a creditor has filed a
summons and complaint for the foreclosure of a mortgage on the
property so that the municipality can identify these properties, inspect
the structures, monitor the condition of the properties, insure that the
properties are maintained, and have a database of information to
contact and provide legal notice to the creditor.

ARTICLE I
General
§ 240-1. Findings and declaration of policy.
It is hereby found and declared that there exist in the Borough of
Lindenwold structures used for residential and nonresidential use which
are or may become substandard with respect to structure, equipment or
maintenance, and, further, that such conditions, including but not limited to
structural deterioration, lack of maintenance and appearance of the exterior
of the premises, infestation, lack of essential heating, plumbing, storage or
refrigeration equipment, lack of maintenance or upkeep of essential utilities
and facilities, existence of fire hazards, inadequate provisions for light and
air, unsanitary conditions and overcrowding, constitute a menace to the
health, safety, morals, welfare and reasonable comfort of the citizens and
inhabitants of the Borough of Lindenwold. It is further found and declared
that, by reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration,
certain properties have the further effect of creating blighting conditions
and initiating slums; and that, if the same are not curtailed and removed,
the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate in time
the expenditure of large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate
the same; and that, by reason of timely regulations and restrictions as
herein contained, the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and
the neighborhood and property values thereby maintained, the desirability
and amenities of residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods
enhanced, and the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.
§ 240-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public health, safety, morals
and welfare by establishing minimum standards governing the
maintenance, appearance, conditions and occupancy of residential and
nonresidential premises; to establish minimum standards governing
utilities, facilities and other physical components and conditions essential
to make the aforesaid facilities fit for human habitation, occupancy and
use; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and operators
and distinct and separate responsibilities and duties upon occupants; to
authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of residential and
nonresidential premises; to fix penalties for the violations of this chapter;
and to provide for the repair, demolition or vacation of premises unfit for
human habitation, occupancy or use. It is intended that any inspections
and/or reports compiled in accordance herewith may be used to aid any
proceeding before any agency or court.

vacated immediately. If the local housing inspector issues this
rating, then no occupancy certificate shall be issued, and any
occupancy shall be a violation of this chapter.

building is in violation of this chapter, but the violations do not
cause the building to be unfit for human habitation. Such a rating
shall permit occupancy, provided that the violations as cited are
corrected within a thirty-day time period. If violations continue to
exist after the expiration of 30 days from notice of a conditional
rating, court action would be instituted and a fine or penalty as

building within the time specified in the order, then the owner shall
be required to remove or demolish said building within a
reasonable time as specified in said order of removal.

§ 250-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 250-7
1:447
Where the inspection of the rental unit results in a satisfactory
inspection, the inspector shall issue a certificate of inspection for
the rental unit. The certificate of inspection shall state the
maximum number of occupants for the rental unit, as determined
by the inspection. An inspection shall be considered satisfactory or
unsatisfactory based upon life safety issues defined in this chapter.
D. Unsatisfactory inspection. In the event that the inspection(s) of a rental
unit does not result in a satisfactory inspection, a certificate of
inspection shall not be issued, and the owner of the property or his
agent shall not lease or rent such property, nor shall any tenant occupy
the property, until the necessary corrections have been made to bring
the property and rental unit into compliance with the applicable code,
and the property is thereafter subsequently inspected. In the event that
the property is occupied when such conditions are discovered, all such
corrections shall be made within 30 days, unless the nature of the
deficiency and the applicable law upon which the inspection is made
mandates a shorter time for repairs, in which event the shorter time
shall govern. In the event that the conditions are not corrected within
the thirty-day time period, or sooner where required, the owner shall be
deemed in violation of this article, and, every day that the violation
continues shall constitute a separate and distinct violation, subject to
the penalty provisions of this chapter. The owner, however, shall be
permitted to apply for an extension of time to make repairs or
corrections so as to comply with this article, for good cause shown.
Where the applicable law upon which the inspection is made mandates
that the property be vacated, the owner or its agent shall cause the
rental unit to be vacated and any such failure to do so shall be a
violation of this chapter. Chapter 248, Relocation Assistance, shall also
apply to any removal of a tenant due to a violation of this chapter.
E. Multiple inspections. It is the intent of this ordinance that each rental
unit be inspected at least once a year but not necessarily more than
once a year, except as set forth in Subsection F. In those instances
where a unit is inspected for a reason other than the annual inspection
under this ordinance, either through a certificate of occupancy
inspection or a New Jersey DCA inspection occurring within the
preceding twelve-month period, that inspection shall count as the
annual inspection under this ordinance provided the same is permitted
by the Administrative Code of the State of New Jersey. The owner shall
be responsible for providing proof to the Local Housing Inspector that
said inspection(s) was made and for obtaining written confirmation
from the Borough that said inspection(s) satisfies the requirements of
this chapter. The owner shall provide written proof of any New Jersey
DCA inspection to the Housing Inspector, including the results of the
DCA inspection. It shall be the responsibility of the owner to notify the
Borough of any rental units that have been inspected, by either the
Borough or State of New Jersey, within the preceding 12 months. The
owner shall notify the Borough in writing, of the previous inspections,
for which the owner is seeking exemption under this provision, within
§ 250-7 LINDENWOLD CODE § 250-7
1:448
§ 250-8. Access for inspections; repairs.
10 calendar days of the scheduled inspections. Failure on the part of
the owner to provide written notice of the previous inspections shall be
construed as a waiver of any exemption, and the Borough shall have
the right to inspect all rental units, pursuant to the provisions of this
ordinance.
F. Waiver of annual inspection: If 85% of the units in a complex are issued
a satisfactory rating following the Borough's annual inspection as to life
safety inspection items, for two consecutive calendar years all units
within the complex shall be exempt from the Borough's annual
inspection in the next subsequent year. In the event the owner is
entitled to a waiver under this paragraph for maintaining two
consecutive years with a satisfactory rating of 85% or more, and the
owner is subject to the DCA inspection in the following year, the waiver
as provided in this paragraph shall carry to the following year, and the
owner may utilize the waiver under this section, in the next calendar
year subsequent to the DCA inspection. This waiver is not absolute and
the Borough reserves the right to inspect before every initial
occupancy, or change in occupancy, and/or or upon a complaint from a
tenant.
A. The inspection officers are hereby authorized to make inspections to
determine the condition of rental facilities, rental units and rooming/
boardinghouses, in order that they may promote the purposes of this
article to safeguard the health, safety and welfare of the occupants of
rental facilities, rental units and rooming/boardinghouses and of the
general public. For the purposes of making such inspections, the
inspecting officers are hereby authorized to enter, examine and survey
rental facilities, rental units and rooming/boardinghouses at all
reasonable times. The owner or occupant of every rental facility, rental
unit and rooming/boardinghouse shall give the inspecting officer free
access to the rental facility, rental unit and rooming/boardinghouse at
all reasonable times, for the purpose of such inspections, examinations
and surveys.
B. Every occupant shall give the owner of the rental facility, rental unit
and rooming/boardinghouse access to any part of such rental facility,
rental unit and rooming/boardinghouse at all reasonable times for the
purpose of making such repairs or alterations, as are necessary, to
effect compliance with the provisions of this article or any lawful order
issued pursuant thereto.
C. Complaints. Within 10 days of receipt of a complaint alleging a reported
violation of this article, an inspecting officer shall conduct an inspection
as hereinbefore provided.
D. In the event that the owner and/or occupant of a unit subject to
inspection under this ordinance refuses access to an inspection officer,
that officer shall make application to the Lindenwold Municipal Court,

on behalf of the complainant in all hearings conducted pursuant to
this section.
C. Defenses. It shall be a defense to any proceeding for the revocation,
suspension or other disciplinary action involving a certificate of

Borough Council have reasonable doubt about the applicant's financial
responsibility to perform the promise, they may request the applicant to
submit reasonable satisfactory evidence of financial responsibility, which
will be reviewed on a confidential basis and not made public in any manner.

the applicant to deposit, pledge or place in escrow or in some other fashion,
including the possible use of a surety bond, certain reasonable amounts
of security with rights of substitution for the faithful performance of the
compliance with all of the performance standards set forth in this chapter or

required, no security shall be required in excess of an amount equal to $500
multiplied by the number of acres to be rehabilitated as designated within
the license area, but not less than $10,000. Any security required shall be

lands to be mined, any unusual request made by the applicant or because
of surrounding property use and condition, including but not limited to
environmental impact statements, wetlands information, surrounding
property use and traffic management and flow. The information received
when requested shall be taken into consideration by the Borough Council
and shall be used to determine the applicability of the property in question
for use as a mining site or may be used in placement of conditions upon any
mining license granted.
§ 253-11. Issuance of license; term; renewal.
If the applicant complies with this chapter and all other applicable
ordinances as set forth, a license shall be issued. The license shall be

license shall be renewed by the Borough Council for succeeding two-year
§ 253-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 253-11
1:461
periods, provided that an application accompanied by either the promise of
the applicant or such reasonable security as may be required, as provided
above, is received from the applicant, and provided that the applicant meets
all terms and conditions of this chapter or any other applicable ordinances
of Lindenwold or their amendments or supplements thereto. The application
for renewal of the license shall be filed within 60 days after receipt of
written notice from the Borough of Lindenwold of the expiration of the
license but not more than four months before the expiration of the license,
and provided that the applicant is carrying out the requirements of the
original license as evidenced by the absence of a judicial determination
at said time to the contrary. Issuance of a license commits the applicant

rehabilitation plan and the provisions of this chapter, its amendments or
supplements.
§ 253-12. License fee.173
Each applicant/licensee shall pay to the Clerk of the Borough of Lindenwold
the fee as established in Chapter 150, Fees, Article I, Fee Schedule,
§ 150-43, to cover the mining license. The payments shall be made prior
to the issuance of the license to the applicant/licensee. The license fee
shall be used by the Borough Council to offset the costs of the Borough for
review, issuance and monitoring of said mining license and rehabilitation
plan provided by the applicant/licensee. If the actual cost to the Borough
for review, issuance and monitoring of any particular mining license shall
be higher than the license fee, then in that event the Mayor and Borough
Council may assess the actual costs incurred by the Borough as an
additional licensing fee upon the applicant/licensee upon notice of such
higher costs to the applicant/licensee.
§ 253-13. Violation and penalties.174
Any person, firm or corporation who or which shall violate any terms or
provisions of this chapter shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to the
penalties as set forth in Chapter 1, § 1-1, of this Code. Each violation of

will be a charge of $14 per year over and above the annual rate for
a domestic consumer unit. This extra charge will be billed quarterly
with the domestic unit. If a disposal unit is in use without a permit
being issued, the Sewer Department will render a bill at the rate of
$14 per year for each year since the initial sewer connection was
made.
(2) When, in the opinion of the Sewer Department, a contract payment
method for sewer service for industrial users is in the best interest
of the Sewer Department, annual service charges for the discharge
of industrial wastes or waters other than sanitary sewage into the
sewerage system of the Sewer Department and annual service
charges with respect to types of property not included above in this
schedule shall be established between the Sewer Department and
the persons contracting for such discharge and use of said system
and the owners of such property on the basis of the quantity of such
discharge or use and the character of such sewage and the cost of
treatment and disposal thereof.
C. Schedule 2, Schedule of Rates for Commercial and Industrial Sanitary
Sewerage Service, is as follows:
(1) Each commercial or industrial user of the sewer system shall pay a
quarterly sewer rental according to Schedule 1194 or on a contract
basis in accordance with the following subsections of Schedule 2 or
Schedules 3 and 4.195
(2) In cases where users using the sewer system have sources of water
supply other than, or in combination with, water supplied through
an approved metered source, such dwellings and establishments
shall provide a meter on the other sources of supply. The total
amount of water consumed, as shown by the sum of all meter
readings, shall be used as the basis for computation of the sewer
rent pursuant to Schedule 3.
(3) In cases where industrial users using the sewer system use water
supplied from any source, and the water so supplied is not entirely
discharged into the sewer system, the amount of water consumed,
to be used as a basis for the computation of the sewer rent
pursuant to Subsection C(1) and applicable use of Schedule 1, shall
be determined by any of the following methods:
(a) The industrial user, at his own expense, shall install a meter or
measuring device approved by the Sewer Department on his
sewer connection with the sewer system, and the readings
from this meter or measuring device shall be used in
computing the sewer rent.

(b) The industrial user, at his own expense, shall install a meter or
measuring device approved by the Sewer Department on the
effluent not discharging into the sewer system, and the
readings from this meter or measuring device shall be
deducted from the readings of all water meters, and the
remainder shall be used in computing the sewer rent.
(c) If the Sewer Department shall decide it is not practicable to
install a meter or measuring device to determine the quantity
of water not discharged into the sewer system, the Sewer
Department will determine in such manner and by such
method as it may prescribe the percentage of metered water
discharged into the sewer system, and the quantity of water
used to compute the sewer rent shall be that percentage so
determined of the total quantity measured by the water meter
or meters.
D. Schedule 3, Additional Charge for Treatment of Industrial Wastes. The
sewer rent for collection and treatment of industrial wastes discharged
into the sewer system shall be based upon a premium charge for extrastrength
waste applied as a factor against the charges for sanitary
sewerage. The premium charge is to be based on the strength factor
determined according to the following formula:
Factor % = 44 +
23
(BOD in ppm)
300
+ 31
(SS** in ppm)
350
+ 2
(Chlorine demand in
ppm*)
15
NOTES:
* Where these figures are less than 300 ppm in BOD or 350 ppm in
suspended solids or 15 ppm in chlorine demand, the value in the
parenthesis shall be equal to "1."
** In case where the suspended solids, in the opinion of the Sewer
Department, do not represent the true characteristics of the solids
loading, the Sewer Department reserves the right to use total
solids instead of suspended solids.
E. Schedule 4. Discharge of water from swimming pools will not be
allowed unless a permit is issued by the Sewer Department. Written
application should be made to the Sewer Department, including
sufficient data for review by the Sewer Department Engineer. A rate
schedule will then be established by the Sewer Department. Swimming
pools shall be emptied at off-peak periods unless specific permission to
the contrary is given.

§ 283-1. Scope and purpose.
A. Policy statement. Flood control, groundwater recharge, and pollutant
reduction through nonstructural or low-impact techniques shall be
explored before relying on structural BMPs. Structural BMPs should be
integrated with nonstructural stormwater management strategies and
proper maintenance plans. Nonstructural strategies include both
environmentally sensitive site design and source controls that prevent
pollutants from being placed on the site or from being exposed to
stormwater. Source control plans should be developed based upon
physical site conditions and the origin, nature and the anticipated
quantity or amount of potential pollutants. Multiple stormwater
management BMPs may be necessary to achieve the established
performance standards for water quality, quantity and groundwater
recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for major
development, as defined in § 283-2.
C. Applicability.

C. Designated as Urban Enterprise Zones; and
Designated as Urban Coordinating Council Empowerment
Neighborhoods.
D.
A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 283-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
§ 283-2 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-3
1:520
§ 283-4. Stormwater management requirements for major
development.
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
(2) The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development
and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on
water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and
maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new
major development to the extent that alternative design and
performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater
management plan or water quality management plan adopted in
accordance with Department rules.
B. Note: Alternative standards shall provide at least as much protection
from stormwater-related loss of groundwater recharge, stormwater
quantity and water quality impacts of major development projects as
would be provided under the standards in N.J.A.C. 7:8-5.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 283-11.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
13:1B-15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or
Clemmys muhlenbergii (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Subsections F and G of this section:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line, provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Subsections F and G of this section may be obtained for
the enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad or the
§ 283-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-4
1:521
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis that,
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Subsections F and G to the
maximum extent practicable;
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Subsections F and G, existing structures currently in use, such
as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
Subsections F and G that were not achievable on site.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Subsections F
and G of this section shall be met by incorporating nonstructural
stormwater management strategies set forth at this Subsection E
into the design. The applicant shall identify the nonstructural
measures incorporated into the design of the project. If the
applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering,
environmental, or safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural
stormwater management measures identified in Subsection E(2)
below into the design of a particular project, the applicant shall
identify the strategy considered and provide a basis for the
contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from
preconstruction to post-construction. "Time of concentration"
is defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
§ 283-4 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-4
1:522
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
(e) Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;

exemptions to this standard see Subsection E(3)(c) below.
(a) Grates.
[1] Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a
storm drain or surface water body under that grate:
[a] The New Jersey Department of Transportation
(NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in
Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible
§ 283-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-4
1:523
Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design
Guidelines (April 1996); or

space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in Subsection G(1) of this section are conveyed
through any device (e.g., end-of-pipe netting facility,
manufactured treatment device, or a catch basin hood)
that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all
solid and floatable materials that could not pass through
one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space 4 5/8 inches long and 1 1/2 inches
wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting
facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inch.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in Subsection G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
§ 283-4 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-4
1:524
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Subsections F and
G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office or subjected to an approved equivalent restriction that
ensures that measure or an equivalent stormwater management
measure approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in
perpetuity.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 283-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 283-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100% of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to post construction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
§ 283-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-4
1:525
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or machinery
located at an industrial facility that is directly or
indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities, which could be a source of
pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to
groundwater. Source materials include, but are not
limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final
products; waste materials; by-products; industrial
machinery and fuels; and lubricants, solvents and
detergents that are related to process, manufacturing,
or other industrial activities that are exposed to
stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 283-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that, for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed at any point in time the
§ 283-4 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-4
1:526
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the post-construction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to postconstruction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 283-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate soil conservation district for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in
stormwater runoff by 80% of the anticipated load from the
developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater
§ 283-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-4
1:527
management measures shall only be required for water quality
control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being
proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated
under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New
Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules,
N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a
NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design
storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality
calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the
water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation
of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation
of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 283-7 or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 283-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
§ 283-4 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-4
1:528
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, P.O. Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (A x B)/100
Where:
R = Total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs
A = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater wetland 90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 283-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converges on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Subsections F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may
be obtained from the address identified in § 283-7.
§ 283-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-4
1:529
(7) In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
(8) Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three-hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession.199
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where an
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water
resource protection area be reduced to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the
waterway or center line of the waterway where the bank is
undefined. All encroachments proposed under this
subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the
Department.
(b) All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil
199. Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art.
II).
§ 283-4 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-4
1:530
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
(c) If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil Erosion
and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established under the
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq.,
then the stabilization measures in accordance with the
requirements of the above standards may be placed within the
special water resource protection area, provided that:
[1] Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
[2] Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a ninety-five-percent TSS postconstruction
removal rate;
[3] Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
[4] The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
[5] A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and soil conservation district
staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and
[6] All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to Subsection G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
special water resource protection area to less than 150 feet as

recharge.
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4, Hydrology and
Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Subsection A(1)(a) of this section and the
Rational and Modified Rational Methods at Subsection A(1)(b). A
runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an
existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the
design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed
on the site or portion of the site for at least five years without
interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land
cover has existed on the site during the five years immediately
prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest
runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition,
there is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic
condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn or park), with good
cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic
condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is
cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows or
§ 283-4 LINDENWOLD CODE § 283-5
1:532
§ 283-6. Standards for structural stormwater management
measures.
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55, Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds, and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
(1) The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32, A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,
incorporated herein by reference, as amended and supplemented.
Information regarding the methodology is available from the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual at
http://www.state.nj.us/dep/stormwater/bmp_manual2.htm or at
New Jersey Geological Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O. Box 427,
Trenton, New Jersey 08625-0427, (609) 984-6587.
A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
(1) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high-water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the
water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water
quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall
be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the diameter of the
§ 283-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-6
1:533
§ 283-7. Sources for technical guidance.
orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing
between bars of one inch and a maximum spacing between bars of
six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with
the requirements of § 283-9B.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed and installed to be strong, durable and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
5:21-7.4, and 5:21-7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of 2 1/2 inches in diameter.
(5) Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at
§ 283-9.
B. Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other
stormwater management measures may be utilized, provided the
design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its
design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater
recharge and water quality design and performance standards
established by § 283-4 of this chapter.
C. Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements
of § 283-4 of this chapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are
verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and
certified by the Department.
A. Technical guidance for stormwater management measures can be
found in the documents listed at Subsection A(1) and (2) below, which
are available from Maps and Publications, New Jersey Department of
Environmental Protection, 428 East State Street, P.O. Box 420, Trenton,
New Jersey 08625; telephone (609) 777-1038.
(1) Guidelines for stormwater management measures are contained in
the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual,
as amended. Information is provided on stormwater management
measures such as bioretention systems, constructed stormwater
wetlands, dry wells, extended detention basins, infiltration
structures, manufactured treatment devices, pervious paving, sand
filters, vegetative filter strips, and wet ponds.

A. Variance or exemption from stormwater design standards.
(1) A variance or exemption from the design standards for stormwater
management basins may be granted only upon a finding by the
Lindenwold Joint Land Use Board that the variance or exemption
will be mitigated by the construction of a stormwater project of
equal construction value within the same subdrainage area (HUC).
[Amended 12-12-2012 by Ord. No. 1331]
(2) In order to be granted a variance or exemption a development must
demonstrate that the design standard cannot be met due to
unusual circumstances on the existing property, such as unusual
surface conditions or extremely low drainage flow rates for the twoyear
storm event. Variances or exemptions are not recommended
for properties where any portion is developed on pervious or
undeveloped open space.
(3) In order to be granted a variance or exemption, the applicant will
be required to perform a preliminary stormwater management
design and cost analysis of the stormwater system that would be
required to meet all the stormwater management requirements of
N.J.A.C. 7:8, Subchapter 5. This analysis will be utilized to
determine and select the mitigation project to be constructed by
the applicant.
B. Mitigation projects.
(1) Stormwater basin retrofit. Provide water quality and recharge
measures at existing stormwater basins within the same HUC14
§ 283-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 283-8
1:535
under the guidance of the Lindenwold Stormwater Management
Coordinator and Public Works Department. The retrofit of existing
basins may be accomplished through a variety and/or combination
of options to meet the mitigation costs required. Each existing
basin condition and surrounding condition should be reviewed with
the Public Works Department before selecting one or more of the
following options:200
(a) Outlet structure modifications.
(b) Regrading and planting.
(c) Elimination of low-flow channels.
(d) Installation of in-line or end-of-pipe best management practice
(BMP) as approved by the NJDEP to pretreat stormwater

STREAM BUFFER CONSERVATION ZONES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Environment  See Ch. 145.
Land use and development  See Ch. 190.
Stormwater management  See Ch. 283.
Stormwater pollution control  See Ch. 287.
Zoning  See Ch. 365.
§ 291-1. Intent, purpose and definitions.
A. In recognition of the fact that natural features contribute to the welfare
of residents, the following regulations have been enacted to provide
reasonable controls governing the restoration, conservation,
disturbance and management of existing stream buffers for all
perennial and intermittent streams and all lakes and ponds in the
municipality by establishing designated Stream Buffer Conservation
Zones.
B. For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:
INTERMITTENT STREAM  A stream with a drainage area of 50 acres
or greater.
PERENNIAL STREAM  A stream that flows continuously throughout
the year in most years.
STREAM  A natural watercourse containing flowing water for at least
part of the year.
C. In addition, the specific purposes and intent of this article are to:
(1) Reduce the amount of nutrients, sediment, organic matter,
pesticides and other harmful substances that reach watercourses,
wetlands, subsurface and surface water bodies by using
scientifically proven processes, including filtration, deposition,
absorption, adsorption, plant uptake, biodegradation,
denitrification, and by improving infiltration, encouraging sheet
flow, and stabilizing concentrated flows.
(2) Improve and maintain the safety, reliability and adequacy of the
water supply for domestic, agricultural, commercial, industrial and
recreational uses, along with sustaining diverse populations of
aquatic flora and fauna.
(3) Regulate the land use, siting and engineering of all development to
be consistent with the intent and objectives of this chapter,
accepted conservation practices, and to work within the carrying
capacity of existing natural resources.
§ 287-39 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 291-1
1:561
§ 291-2. Establishment of Stream Buffer Conservation Zone.
(4) Assist in the implementation of pertinent state laws concerning
erosion and sediment control practices.
(5) Conserve the natural features important to land and water
resources (e.g., headwater areas, groundwater recharge zones,
floodway, floodplain, springs, streams, wetlands, woodlands, prime
wildlife habitats) and other features constituting high recreational
value or containing amenities that exist on developed and
undeveloped land.
(6) Work with floodplain, steep slope, and other ordinances that
regulate environmentally sensitive areas to minimize hazards to
life, property and stream features.
(7) Conserve natural, scenic and recreation areas within and adjacent
to stream areas for the community's benefit.
A. Definition. The Stream Buffer Conservation Zone is defined as areas
surrounding municipally designated surface water bodies, including
creeks, lakes and intermittent watercourses, that intercept surface
water runoff, wastewater, subsurface flow, and/or deep groundwater
flows from upland sources and function to remove or buffer the effects
of associated nutrients, sediment, organic matter, pesticides or other
pollutants prior to entry into surface waters. This area may also provide
wildlife habitat, control water temperature, attenuate flood flow, and
provide opportunities for passive recreation. This buffer area may or
may not contain trees and other native vegetation at the time of
ordinance enactment.
B. Establishment.
(1) The establishment of the Stream Buffer Conservation Zone applies
to the following areas, which are identified on the Municipal
Stream Buffer Map:
(a) Lands adjacent to municipally designated streams within the
municipality.
(b) Lands adjacent to municipally designated intermittent
watercourses within the municipality.
(c) Lands at the margins of municipally designated lakes.
(2) The measurement of the Stream Buffer Conservation Zone shall
extend a minimum of 75 feet from each defined edge of an
identified watercourse or surface water body at bankfull flow or
level or shall equal the extent of the one-hundred-year floodplain,
whichever is greater. The zone will consist of two distinct zones
designated as:224
(a) Zone One.
§ 291-1 LINDENWOLD CODE § 291-2
1:562
§ 291-3. Permitted uses.
The following uses are permitted, either by right or after review and
approval by the municipality, in the Stream Buffer Conservation Zone.
However, within any buffer, no construction, development, use, activity or
encroachment shall be permitted unless the activity is described in the
stream buffer management plan, as outlined in § 291-8.
[1] This zone will begin at each edge of an identified waterway
(which can include wetlands and intermittent
watercourses) and occupy a margin of land with a
minimum width of 25 feet measured horizontally on a line
perpendicular to the edge of water at bankfull flow.
[2] Where steep slopes (in excess of 25%) are located within
25 feet of a municipally designated watercourse, Zone One
shall extend the entire distance of this sloped area. If the
distance of this sloped area is greater than 75 feet, there
will be no requirement for the establishment of Zone Two.
If the distance is less than 75 feet, the width of Zone Two
will be adjusted so that the total buffer width (Zone One
and Zone Two) will be 75 feet maximum.
(b) Zone Two.
[1] This zone will begin at the outer edge of Zone One and
occupy a minimum width of 50 feet in addition to Zone
One.
[2] Where the one-hundred-year floodplain extends greater
than 75 feet from the waterway, Zone One shall remain a
minimum of 25 feet wide, and Zone Two shall extend from
the outer edge of Zone One to the outer edge of the onehundred-
year floodplain.
(3) Width determination. The developer, applicant or designated
representative shall be responsible for the initial width
determination of the stream buffer and identifying this area on any
plan that is submitted to the municipality for subdivision, land
development, or other improvements that require plan submissions
or permits. This initial determination shall be subject to review and
approval by the Municipal Engineer, governing body, or its
appointed representative.
A. Zone One.
(1) Uses permitted by right. Open space uses that are primarily
passive in character shall be permitted to extend into the area
defined as Zone One, including:

the stream buffer management plan.
(2) Uses requiring municipal review and approval. Buffer crossings by
farm vehicles and livestock, recreational trails, roads, railroads,
centralized sewer and/or water lines, and public utility
transmission lines, provided that any disturbance is offset by buffer
improvements identified in the stream buffer management plan.
B. Zone Two.
(1) Uses permitted by right. The following uses, which are primarily
passive in character, shall be permitted by right to extend into the
area defined as Zone Two:
(a) Open space uses, including wildlife sanctuaries, nature
preserves, forest preserves, passive areas of public and private
parklands, and recreational trails.
(b) Reforestation in compliance with the guidelines of the stream
buffer management plan.
(c) Minimum required front, side and rear yards on private lots,
provided that no yard may extend into Zone Two more than
half the distance between the outer boundaries of Zone One
and Zone Two.
(d) Agricultural uses existing at the time of adoption of this
chapter.
(2) Uses requiring municipal review and approval.
(a) New agricultural uses.
(b) Buffer crossings by farm vehicles and livestock, roads,
railroads, centralized sewer and/or water lines, and public
utility transmission lines, provided that any disturbance is, at a
minimum, offset by buffer improvements identified in the
stream buffer management plan.
(c) Centralized sewer and/or water lines and public utility
transmission lines running along the buffer, provided that any
disturbance is, at a minimum, offset by buffer improvements
identified in the stream buffer management plan. These lines
shall be located as far from Zone One as practical.
(d) Selective cutting of trees when removal is consistent with
approved standards in the stream buffer management plan.
§ 291-3 LINDENWOLD CODE § 291-3
1:564

from qualified sources certifying their suitability. The municipality may
require species suitability to be verified by qualified experts in the Camden
County Conservation District, Natural Resources Conservation Service,
New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, the U.S. Fish and
Wildlife Service, or state and federal forest agencies.
A. Lands within or adjacent to an identified Stream Buffer Conservation
Zone will be inspected by the municipal representative when:
(1) A subdivision or land development plan is submitted.
(2) A building permit is requested.
(3) A change or resumption of nonconforming use is proposed.
B. The zone may also be inspected periodically by the municipal
representative for compliance with an approved restoration plan,
excessive or potentially problematic erosion, or at any time when the
presence of an unauthorized activity or structure is brought to the
attention of municipal officials.226

prospective bidders; provided, however, that such qualifications shall

agency thereof. The ordinance may fix a minimum bid price and
conditions of sale with reservation of the right to reject all bids where

B. Regulating dish-type antennas. Dish-type antennas shall be regulated in
the Borough of Lindenwold in accordance with this section.
C. Location. A property owner in the Borough of Lindenwold is permitted
to install and/or erect one dish-type antenna on such owner's property.
The dish-type antenna should be installed at ground level in the rear
yard of the property. If, however, installation of the dish antenna in the
rear yard at ground level would result in interference with reasonable
satellite television reception, then installation of the dish-type antenna
on the side yard would be permitted. If installation in the side yard still
produces interference with reasonable satellite television reception,
then the satellite may be mounted on the roof. Mounting on the rear
portion of the roof must first be explored. Only if rear mounting cannot
be done due to the interference with reasonable satellite television
reception signal will front roof mounting be permitted. The dish-type
antenna, its foundation pad and supportive structure must be a
minimum of 10 feet from the property line, provided that said
placement does not interfere with reasonable satellite television
reception. If said placement does result in interference with reasonable
satellite television reception, then the owner will be permitted to erect
the antenna, its foundation and supporting structure as close to the

§ 365-116. Sensitive area requirements.
Sensitive areas are lands wherein additional caution is needed for
development to take place, in order to protect against substantial detriment
E. The cost of providing and maintaining public facilities and services to
those areas where critical steep slopes may be disturbed shall not be
substantially increased as a result of such disturbance.
F. Critical steep slopes. The following standards shall apply to
construction in critical steep slope areas:
(1) The removal of trees within a critical steep slope shall be
prohibited except in accordance with a plan approved by the
Municipal Engineer and all applicable agencies. If a variance is
requested from the prohibition of removal of trees within a critical
steep slope, the Board may require replanting of trees or other
acceptable landscape materials in a ratio of one plant for every two
removed in order to mitigate the disturbance.
(2) The disturbance resulting from the development of any critical
steep slope shall be revegetated to the satisfaction of the Board and
the Board's professionals. The landscaping should provide longterm
stabilization, use vegetation native to Lindenwold and require
low maintenance.
(3) The development within a critical steep slope shall require the
disturbed areas to be graded and stabilized in accordance with
New Jersey Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39
et seq., immediately following construction, even if the disturbance
is less than 5,000 square feet.294
(4) The flow of stormwater runoff above or upon the critical steep slope
shall be disbursed, conveyed or otherwise controlled in a manner
which will avert the concentration of surface flows. The applicant
shall demonstrate that there will not be a substantial increase in
the peak rate of runoff from the two-, ten- or one-hundred-year
storm from the proposed development onto any adjacent property,
even if the development does not meet the definition of "major
development" under the Residential Site Improvement Standards.
A substantial increase will be considered any flow greater than one
cubic foot per second (cfs) from a design storm event.295
(5) Driveways shall be prohibited on critical steep slopes unless it is
demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Board that no feasible
alternative exists, in which case the driveway shall be graded to a
maximum of 10%.
