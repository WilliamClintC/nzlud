EMINENT DOMAIN
§ 44-1. Findings of the Mayor and Council.
WHEREAS, on June 23, 2005, the Supreme Court of the United States
decided the case of Kelo v. City of New London in which a majority of the
§ 39-4 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 44-1
1:78
Court determined, among other things, that the "public purpose provision of
the United States Constitution should be broadly interpreted to effectuate
legislative judgments as to what particular needs justify the use of the
power of eminent domain; and
WHEREAS, the result in Kelo was a plurality decision, reflecting the Court's
deep division on the question presented, namely whether private residential
real property may be the subject of eminent domain in order to satisfy a
public purpose such as a planned development; and
WHEREAS, the result of the Kelo decision was that, where there existed
a comprehensive plan of development that is deemed to satisfy the public
purpose provision of the Constitution, even though the "motivation" for the
plan might be economic development, municipalities could use the eminent
domain power to achieve the desired end as long as all parties' legal rights
were established in the process; and
WHEREAS, the Kelo majority opinion specifically emphasized that nothing
in the decision should preclude a state from placing further restrictions on
the takings power; and
WHEREAS, one of the issues faced by the Court was the appropriate line
between public and private use; and
WHEREAS, under the settled law of the State of New Jersey, the limitless
sovereign power of the State may be employed to take real property as
may be required for public safety, necessity, convenience or welfare so long
as just compensation is paid the owner, but it is for the legislative branch
of government to determine what constitutes a public use as to limit that
broad power, with the result that the power is to be used in a reasonable
non-arbitrary manner, and not greater than necessary to effectuate the
public use; and
WHEREAS, the Borough of Waldwick believes that one of the primary
purposes of government is to protect the rights of owner-occupied
residential real properties within the Borough against governmental takings
that do not have as their goal, either (a) the transfer of private property to
public ownership for the creation of, for example, a road, hospital or military
base or (b) the transfer of private property to private owners for the specific
purpose of making the same available for public use (e.g. railroad, public
utility or stadium).
§ 44-2. Eminent domain.
BE IT ORDAINED, by the Mayor and Council of the Borough of Waldwick,
County of Bergen, and the State of New Jersey, that the Borough shall
not employ the power of eminent domain so as to deprive owner-occupiers
of residential real properties of such ownership rights in the absence of
a specified purpose (a) to transfer the property to public ownership for
the creation of a public use including, but not limited to a road, hospital,
military base, sewer, water line, sidewalk, right-of-way, flood control, park,
§ 44-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 44-2
1:79
open space, erosion control mechanism and the like, or (b) to transfer the
property to private owners for the specific purpose of making the same

FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION
§ 52-1. Findings of fact.
§ 52-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
§ 52-3. Methods of reducing flood losses.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Borough of Waldwick are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.

victimization of the public as identified in § 52-7.1D, or conflict with
existing local laws or ordinances.
F. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
B. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved shall be
anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of

ARTICLE II
Fertilizers
§ 67-6. Purpose.
An ordinance to regulate the outdoor application of fertilizer so as to reduce
the overall amount of excess nutrients entering waterways, thereby helping
to protect and improve surface water quality. This ordinance does not apply
to fertilizer application on commercial farms.
§ 67-7. Basis and background.
Elevated levels of nutrients, particularly phosphorus, in surface
waterbodies can result in excessive and accelerated growth of algae and
aquatic plants (eutrophication). Excessive plant growth can result in diurnal
variations and extremes in dissolved oxygen and pH, which, in turn, can be
detrimental to aquatic life. As algae and plant materials die off, the decay
process creates a further demand on dissolved oxygen levels. The presence
of excessive plant matter can also restrict use of the affected water for
recreation and water supply.
While healthy vegetated areas are protective of water quality by stabilizing
soil and filtering precipitation, when fertilizers are applied to the land
surface improperly or in excess of the needs of target vegetation, nutrients
can be transported by means stormwater to nearby waterways, contributing
to the problematic growth of excessive aquatic vegetation. Most soils in
New Jersey contain sufficient amounts of phosphorus to support adequate
root growth for established turf. Over time, it is necessary to replenish
available phosphorus, but generally not at the levels commonly applied.
Other target vegetation, such as vegetable gardens and agricultural/
horticultural plantings, will have a greater need for phosphorus application,
as will the repair or establishment of new lawns or cover vegetation. A
soils test and fertilizer application recommendation geared to the soil and
planting type is the best means to determine the amount of nutrients to
apply. Timing and placement of fertilizer application is also critical to avoid
transport of nutrients to waterways through stormwater runoff. Fertilizer
applied immediately prior to a runoff-producing rainfall, outside the
growing season or to impervious surfaces is most likely to be carried
away by means of runoff without accomplishing the desired objective of
supporting target vegetation growth. Therefore, the management of the
type, amount and techniques for fertilizer application is necessary as one
tool to protect water resources.
This ordinance does not apply to application of fertilizer on commercial
farms, but improper application of fertilizer on farms would be problematic
as well. Stewardship on the part of commercial farmers is needed to address
this potential source of excess nutrient load to waterbodies. Commercial
farmers are expected to implement best management practices in
accordance with conservation management plans or resource conservation
§ 67-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 67-7
1:185
plans developed for the farm by the Natural Resource Conservation Service
and approved by the Soil Conservation District Board.
§ 67-8. Definitions.
For the purpose of this ordinance, the following terms, phrases, words, and
their derivations shall have the meanings stated herein unless their use in
the text of this Ordinance clearly demonstrates a different meaning. When
not inconsistent with the context, words used in the present tense include
the future, words used in the plural number include the singular number,
and words used in the singular number include the plural number. The word
"shall" is always mandatory and not merely directory.
BUFFER  The land area, 25 feet in width, adjacent to any waterbody.
COMMERCIAL FARM  A farm management unit producing agricultural or
horticultural products worth $2,500 or more annually.

substance containing one or more recognized plant nutrients, which is used
for its plant nutrient content, which is designed for use or claimed to have
value in promoting plant growth, and which is sold, offered for sale, or
intended for sale.
IMPERVIOUS SURFACE  A surface that has been covered with a layer of
material so that it is highly resistant to infiltration by water. This term shall
be used to include any highway, street, sidewalk, parking lot, driveway, or
other material that prevents infiltration of water into the soil.
PERSON  Any individual, corporation, company, partnership, firm,
association, or political subdivision of this State subject to municipal
jurisdiction.
PHOSPHORUS FERTILIZER  Any fertilizer that contains phosphorus,
expressed as P2O5, with a guaranteed analysis of greater than zero; except
that it shall not be considered to include animal (including human) or
vegetable manures, agricultural liming materials, or wood ashes that have
not been amended to increase their nutrient content.
SOILS TEST  A technical analysis of soil conducted by an accredited
soil testing laboratory following the protocol for such a test established by
Rutgers Cooperative Research and Extension.

ARTICLE V
Sump Pumps
§ 75-15.1. Intent and Purpose.
The implementation of this section will aid the Borough by limiting and
reducing the inflow of additional water into the sanitary sewer systems.
By prohibiting the discharge of water from any roof, surface ground, sump
pump, swimming pool, other natural precipitation, and other sources of
inflow into the Borough's sanitary sewer system, the Borough is seeking
to reduce costs as well as protect against other damaging affects. The
Borough's sanitary sewer system will and has on occasions in the past been
overloaded and flooded thereby creating the potential to cause significant
damage or threat to individual's property as well as the system. Further,
all water that enters the system must be treated at the sewage treatment
plant. Therefore, by reducing and eliminating this inflow of "clean water"
into the sanitary sewer system and the subsequent unnecessary treatment,
the expenses to the Borough and the citizens will be reduced and will assist
in protecting the health, safety and welfare of the residents of the Borough.
§ 75-15.2. Violation.
A. Prohibited Discharges. No person or entity shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any stormwater, groundwater, roof runoff, yard drainage,
yard fountain, swimming pool, pond, overflow, or any other substance
other than sanitary sewage into the sanitary sewer collection system.
No person, business or other entity shall discharge or cause to be
discharged any hazardous substances into any public sewers.
B. Amnesty Period for Disconnection.
1. On or before December 31, 2011, any person, business, or other
entity who shall have a connection described above and who shall
voluntarily report said connection to the Borough, so that said illicit
connection shall be remedied, shall have any and all permit,
connection and inspection fees waived by the Borough. This waiver
of fees applies only to Borough fees, and does not include the actual
cost of remediation.
2. After December 31, 2011, any person, business, or other entity who
shall have a connection described above, any shall fail to
voluntarily report such connection by December 31, 2011, shall be
liable for all permit fees, inspection fees, and connection fees as
required by the Borough, to remedy the illicit connection.
C. Manner of Disconnection.
1. Any property owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a
property interest who shall have a connection in violation of this
Ordinance, or not obtained a waiver pursuant to Section 75:15.7,
shall immediately remove such connection and correct such

2. All disconnections of said illicit connections shall be accomplished
by a complete and permanent method and performed in a
competent manner and approved and inspected by the Borough
Building Inspector, any Borough sub-code inspector, Borough Fire
Code official and/or Borough Engineer. Any disconnection,
plugging, capping, re-routing, altering, or modifying must be done
in accordance with all applicable state and municipal building
codes.
3. Upon issuance of the Surcharge pursuant to Section 75:15.4, if the
property owner, tenant, landlord, or other person with a property

reporting is determined to be in violation of any section of this ordinance,
shall be permitted to file for a waiver of the Surcharge requirement of
Section 75:15.4, if they can prove that they have exhausted all possible
remedial measures. Remedial measures include but are not limited to,
the installation of a dry-well, the connection to a storm sewer, and/or

the Borough of Waldwick shall remove all snow and ice from the sidewalks
of any such street within 24 hours after the same shall cease to fall or
to be formed thereon, or in the case of ice which may be so frozen to
the sidewalks as to make removal impractical, shall cause the same to be
thoroughly covered with sand or ashes within the same period. All sidewalks
must be shoveled for the full width of the sidewalk and driveway apron. Any
sidewalk terminating at a corner must be shoveled to the point where the

lines thereof. No person shall throw, place or deposit snow or ice into or
upon the property of another person without the property owner's express

the owner or occupant of the premises is in violation of Chapter 79 shall be
considered a separate violation.
Should the Police Department, Fire Department, or the Board of Health
deem that the location of snow and ice on any sidewalk or street represents
an immediate danger to the public health safety and welfare, then such
snow and ice may be removed by and under the direction of the
Superintendent of Public Works. All reasonable efforts shall be made to
notify the owner or occupant of the condition and the need to remedy
such hazard. The cost thereof shall be certified by the Superintendent of
Public Works to the governing body, which shall examine such certificate
of cost, and if it finds said certificate to be correct, shall cause such costs
to be charged against the real estate abutting upon such sidewalks. The
amount so charged shall thereupon become a lien and tax upon said real
estate and be added to and become a part of the taxes next to be levied
and assessed thereon, and enforced and collected, with interest, by the
same officers and in the same manner as other taxes. The imposition and
collection of any penalty imposed by the provisions of § 79-5 hereof shall not
constitute any bar to the right of the Borough to collect such assessment of
costs as certified for the removal of said snow or ice in the manner herein
authorized.

such pools into a brook or storm sewer shall be permitted only following
approval by the proper state, county and/or municipal officials, as the case
requires. Approval of an application shall only be given if it is feasible to

The Council hereby finds and declares that problems of traffic control
occur when traffic must be moved through or around street construction,
maintenance operations, and utility work, above and below ground, which
requires blocking the roadway and obstructing the normal flow of traffic;
and that such obstructions are or can become dangerous when not properly
controlled. In order to better promote the public health, safety, peace and
welfare, it is necessary to establish controls and regulation directed to
the safe and expeditious movement of traffic through construction and
maintenance zones and to provide safety for the work force performing
these operations.
The Borough of Waldwick does hereby adopt the current Manual on Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, hereinafter known as M.U.T.C.D., as supplemented
and amended, as it controls and regulates construction operations of utility
work, which obstructs the normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor
or utility that fails to comply with the provisions of M.U.T.C.D. while
performing such work is in violation of this section.
PRE-CONSTRUCTION MEETING
It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor, or in the case of
a public utility as required under the public utility agreement, wishing to
conduct work on, under or above the roadway to contact the Traffic Bureau
of the Waldwick Police Department in order to arrange a pre-construction
meeting to submit plans for the safe movement of traffic during such period
of construction of work. Any person, contractor or utility who fails to comply
with this section prior to the start of such work or whose plans are not
approved by the Traffic Bureau of the Waldwick Police Department is in
violation of this section.
EMERGENCY CONTACT TELEPHONE NUMBERS
The person, contractor, or utility shall provide the Traffic Bureau of the
Waldwick Police Department with at least two (2) emergency contact phone
numbers to be called in case of emergency problems at the construction or
maintenance site prior to the start of any work. If for any reason emergency
contact cannot be reached, or if the emergency contact person does not
respond to the call from the Police Department to correct a hazardous
§ 91-6 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 91-7
1:276
condition, the Borough may respond to correct such hazardous conditions.
The reasonable costs for such emergency services by the Borough shall be
charged to the person, contractor or utility.
HOURS
Except in the case of an emergency, there shall be no construction,
maintenance operations or utility work on any roadway in the Borough
before the hour of 9:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. Road closing and/or traffic
detours shall not be permitted unless approved by the Traffic Bureau of the
Waldwick Police Department.
ROAD CLOSING
Road closing and/or traffic detours shall not be permitted unless approved
by the Waldwick Police Department.
TRAFFIC DIRECTORS
A traffic director shall be posted at all construction or maintenance sites
when determined by the Traffic Bureau of the Waldwick Police Department
that they are necessary to provide for the safe and expeditious movement of
traffic.
STOP WORK
In order to abate any nuisance and/or safety hazard, the Traffic Bureau of
the Waldwick Police Department shall have the authority to order (i) work
stop; (ii) the removal of equipment, vehicles and materials stored within the
street right of way; (iii) the back filling of open excavations and/or other
related work.
SITE PREPARATION
No vehicles or equipment are to be placed in the roadway or sidewalk
area until all construction signs, lights, devices and pavement markings are
installed.
VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES
See § 1-14.1.
§ 91-8. Parking.
Regulations not Exclusive
The provisions of this chapter imposing a time limit on parking shall not
relieve any person of the duty to observe other, more restrictive provisions
prohibiting or limiting the stopping or standing or parking of vehicles as set
forth in N.J.S.A. 39:4-138, any other New Jersey Statute or as hereinafter
provided.
§ 91-9. Parking prohibited during state of emergency.
§ 91-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 91-9
1:277
§ 91-10. Temporary parking prohibition for snow plowing and
removal.
§ 91-11. Stopping or standing prohibited during certain hours on
certain streets.
(Reserved)
§ 91-12. Parking time limited on certain streets.
a. Upon the declaration of an emergency, there shall be no parking upon
streets or sections of streets where temporary EMERGENCY NO
PARKING signs are displayed. The chief of police or in his/her absence,
the ranking police officer is authorized to declare an emergency and to
direct the posting of EMERGENCY NO PARKING signs when weather
conditions, accidents, road construction, fire or public celebrations
dictate or require avoidance of hazards or other conditions which
interfere with the free flow of traffic. Notification that EMERGENCY
NO PARKING signs are being or will be posted shall be given to the
operator or owner of any vehicle, which has been parked prior to the
posting of the signs.
b. The effectiveness of this subsection is contingent upon the signs being
erected as required by law.
a. Whenever snow has fallen and the accumulation is such that it covers
the streets or highways, an emergency shall exist and no vehicle shall
be parked on any street or highway within the Borough. The above
parking prohibitions shall remain in effect after the snow has ceased
until the streets have been plowed sufficiently and to the extent that
parking will not interfere with the normal flow of traffic.
b. Any unoccupied vehicle parked or standing in violation shall be deemed
a nuisance and a menace to the safe and proper regulation of traffic and
any police officer may provide for the removal of such vehicle. The
owner shall pay the reasonable costs of the removal and storage, which
may result from such removal before regaining possession of the
vehicle.
A. Parking Time Limited Certain Hours. No person shall park a vehicle for
longer than the time limit between the hours listed on any day (except
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) upon any of the streets or
parts of streets described. [Amended Ord 8-09; 4-12-16 by Ord. No.

§ 97-15. Establishment; composition.
§ 97-16. Alternate members. [Added 1-25-83 by Ord. No. 1-83]
A. A Zoning Board of Adjustment is hereby established pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-69 et seq., consisting of seven (7) residents of the Borough of
Waldwick appointed by the Mayor, subject to confirmation by the
Council, to serve for terms of four (4) years from January 1 of the year of
their appointment. The terms of the members first appointed shall be so
determined that to the greatest practicable extent the expiration of
such terms shall be distributed evenly over the first four (4) years after
their appointment, provided that the initial term of no member shall
exceed four (4) years. Thereafter, the term of each member shall be for
four (4) years. Nothing in this ordinance shall, however, be construed to
affect the terms of any present members of the Zoning Board of
Adjustment, all of whom shall continue in office until the completion of
the terms for which they were appointed.
B. No member or alternate member of the Zoning Board of Adjustment
may hold any elective office or position under the municipality. This
shall not be deemed to prohibit appointed officials of the municipality or
elected officials of another corporate entity such as the Board of
Education from serving as a member or alternate member. [Amended
8-22-00 by Ord. No. 14-00]
C. A vacancy occurring otherwise than by expiration of term shall be filled
for the unexpired term only, in the manner hereinabove set forth for

[Added 8-22-00 by Ord. No. 14-00]
A. The Zoning Board of Adjustment, in addition to its seven (7) regular
members, shall also consist of two (2) alternate members. The alternate
members shall be appointed by the Mayor and Council in the same
manner as the Mayor and Council appoints regular members.
B. The terms of office of the alternate members shall be for two years. The
initial appointment shall be made so that the term of not more than one
alternate member shall expire in any one year. [Amended 8-22-00 by
Ord. No. 14-00]
C. Alternate members may participate in all matters but may not vote,
except in absence or disqualification of a regular member. Participation
of alternate members shall not be deemed an increase in the size of the
Zoning Board of Adjustment. A vote of the Zoning Board of Adjustment
shall not be delayed in order that a regular member may vote in place of
an alternate member. Should there be a choice as to which alternate

with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-69 et seq. and amendments and supplements
thereto and with the provisions of this ordinance.
B. It is further the intent of this ordinance to confer upon the Zoning Board
of Adjustment as full and complete powers as may be lawfully conferred
upon such Board, including, but not by way of limitation, the authority,
in connection with any case, action or proceeding before the Board, to
interpret and construe the provisions of this ordinance or any term,
clause, sentence or word hereof and the Zoning Map, in accordance
with the general rules of construction applicable to legislative
enactments.
C. The Board may, in appropriate cases and subject to appropriate
conditions and safeguards, grant variances from the terms of this
ordinance in accordance with the general or specific rules contained
§ 97-16 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-21
1:358
§ 97-22. Appeals and applications.
herein and with the general rules hereby laid down that equity shall
be done in cases where the strict construction of the provisions of
this ordinance would work undue hardship. The powers and duties of
the Board having been delegated to and imposed upon it by statute,
the Board shall, in all cases, follow the provisions applicable to it
in said c. 291, P.L. 1975, or subsequent statutes in such case made
and provided, and it shall, from time to time, furnish to any person
requesting the same a copy of its rules and information as to how
appeals or applications may properly be filed with the Board for its
decision thereon.
A. Applications for building permits shall be made to the Building
Inspector, who shall approve or deny such applications. Appeals to the
Board of Adjustment may be taken by any interested party. Each appeal
shall be taken within twenty (20) days, as prescribed by the statute, by
filing a notice of appeal with the officer from whom the appeal was
taken, together with ten (10) copies of said notice with the Secretary of
the Board of Adjustment. Said notice of appeal shall specify the grounds
for said appeal. The officer from whom the appeal is taken shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed from was taken. [Amended 8-22-00
by Ord. No. 14-00]
B. A developer may file an application for development with the Board of
Adjustment for action under any of its powers without prior application
to the Building Inspector. All applications addressed to the original
jurisdiction of the Board of Adjustment without prior application for a
building permit from the Building Inspector shall be filed with the
Secretary of the Board of Adjustment. Three (3) copies of the
application shall be filed. At the time of filing the appeal or application,
but in no event less than ten (10) days prior to the date set for hearing,
the applicant shall also file all plot plans, maps or other papers required
by virtue of any provision of this ordinance or any rule of the Board of
Adjustment. The applicant shall obtain all necessary forms from the
Secretary of the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The Secretary of the
Board shall inform the applicant of the steps to be taken to initiate
proceedings and of the regular meeting dates of the Board.
C. An appeal stays all proceedings in furtherance of the action in respect
of which the decision appealed from was made, unless the officer from
whom the appeal is taken certifies to the Board of Adjustment after the
notice of appeal shall have been filed with him/her that by reason of
facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in his/her opinion, cause
imminent peril to life or property. In such cases, proceedings shall not
be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted
by the Superior Court of New Jersey on application and notice to the
officer from which the appeal is taken and on due cause shown.

§ 97-23. Power to reverse or modify decisions.
In exercising the above-mentioned power, the Board of Adjustment may, in
conformity with the provisions of c. 291, P.L. 1975, or amendments thereto
or subsequent statutes applying, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or
modify the order, requirement, decision or determination appealed from
and make such other requirement, decision or determination as ought to be
made, and to that end have all the powers of the administrative officer from
whom the appeal was taken.
§ 97-24. Expiration of variance.
Any variance from the terms of this ordinance hereafter granted by the
Board of Adjustment permitting the erection or alteration of any structure
or structures or permitting a specified use of any premises shall expire by
limitation unless such construction or alteration shall have been actually
commenced on each and every structure permitted by said variance, or
unless such permitted use has actually been commenced, within one (1)
year from the date of publication of the notice of the judgment or
determination of the Board of Adjustment; except, however, that the
running of the period of limitation herein provided shall be tolled from the
date of filing an appeal from the decision of the Board of Adjustment to the
governing body or to a court of competent jurisdiction until the termination
in any manner of such appeal or proceeding.
§ 97-25. Powers granted by law.
A. The Board of Adjustment shall have such powers as are granted by law
to:
1. Hear and decide appeals where it is alleged by the appellant that
there is error in any order, requirement, decision or refusal made
by an administrative official or agency based on or made in the
enforcement of the Zoning, Land Use and Development Code.
2. Hear and decide requests for interpretation of the Zoning Map or
Zoning, Land Use and Development Code, or for decisions upon
other special questions upon which such Board is authorized by the
Land Use and Development Code to pass.
3. Appeal due to hardship. [Amended 2-12-85 by Ord. No. 2-85]
a. Where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or
shape of a specific piece of property, or by reason of
exceptional topographic conditions or physical features unique
affecting a specific piece of property, or by reason of an
extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a
specific piece of property or the structures lawfully existing
thereon, the strict application of any regulation in the Zoning,
Land Use and Development Code of Waldwick would result in
peculiar and exceptional practical difficulties to, exceptional
§ 97-23 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-25
1:360
and undue hardship upon the developer of such property,
grant, upon an application or an appeal relating to such
property, a variance from such strict application of such
regulation so as to relieve such difficulties or hardship.
b. Where, in an application or appeal relating to a specific piece
of property, the purposes of the Municipal Land Use Law would
be advanced by a deviation from the Land Use and
Development Code requirements and the benefits of the
deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, grant a
variance to allow departure from regulations in the Zoning,
Land Use and Development Code of the Borough of Waldwick;
provided, however, that the fact that a proposed use is an
inherently beneficial use shall not be dispositive of a decision
on a variance under this subsection and provided, that no
variance from those departures enumerated in N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d shall be granted under this subsection, and
provided further that the proposed development does not
require approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision, site
plan or conditional use in conjunction with which the Planning
Board has the power to review a request for a variance
pursuant to § 97-11 of this Ordinance. [Amended 8-22-00 by
Ord. No. 14-00]
4. In particular cases and for special reasons, grant a variance to
allow departure from the Zoning, Land Use and Development Code
of the Borough of Waldwick to permit a use or principal structure in
a district restricted against such use or principal structure; an
expansion of a nonconforming use; deviation from a specification or
standard pertaining solely to a conditional use; an increase in the
permitted floor area ratio as defined by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4; an
increase in the permitted density, as defined by N.J.S.A. 40:55D-4,
except that with respect to an application for a variance from the
density requirements for a detached one or two-dwelling unit
building on an isolated undersized lot, or on a lot resulting from a
minor subdivision, such application shall be made pursuant to §
97-25A(3); or a height of a principal structure which exceeds by ten
(10) feet or ten percent (10%) the maximum height permitted in the
district for a principal structure at least five (5) members of the full
authorized membership of the Board. [Amended 2-12-85 by Ord.
No. 2-85; 8-22-00 by Ord. No. 14-00]
B. No variance or other relief may be granted under the provisions of this
section including a variance or other relief involving an inherently
beneficial use, without showing that such variance or other relief can be
granted without substantial detriment to the public good and will not
substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and Zoning,
Land Use and Development Code. Any application under any subsection
of this section may be referred to any appropriate person or agency,
including the Planning Board, for its report, provided that such

specified, any interested party may apply to the Superior Court in
a summary manner for an order compelling the municipal agency
to reduce its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated
time, and the cost of the application, including attorney's fees, shall

§ 97-52. Definitions.
The following terms, as used in this article, shall have the following
meanings:
AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT  Means a development
included in the Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but
is not limited to, an inclusionary development, a municipal construction
project or a 100 percent affordable development.
COAH or THE COUNCIL  Means the New Jersey Council on Affordable
Housing established under the Act which has primary jurisdiction for the
administration of housing obligations in accordance with sound regional
planning consideration in the State.
a) In Holmdel Builder's Association v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550
(1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's adoption of rules.
b) Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 section 8 (C. 52:27D-329.2) and the
Statewide Non-Residential Development Fee Act (C. 40:55D-8.1
through 8.7), COAH is authorized to adopt and promulgate regulations
necessary for the establishment, implementation, review, monitoring
and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust funds and
corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under the
jurisdiction of the Council or court of competent jurisdiction and have a
COAH-approved spending plan may retain fees collected from nonresidential
development.
c) This ordinance establishes standards for the collection, maintenance,
and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations
and in accordance with P.L. 2008, c. 46, Sections 8 and 32-38. Fees
collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be used for the sole purpose
of providing low and moderate-income housing. This ordinance shall be
interpreted within the framework of COAH's rules on development fees,
codified at N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.
3. Basic requirements.
a) This ordinance shall not be effective until approved by COAH
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.1.
b) The Borough of Waldwick shall not spend development fees
until COAH has approved a plan for spending such fees in
conformance with N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.10 and N.J.A.C. 5:96-5.3.
§ 97-51 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-52
1:373
DEVELOPMENT FEE  Means money paid by a developer for the
improvement of property as permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:97-8.3.
DEVELOPER  Means the legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or
of any land proposed to be included in a proposed development, including
the holder of an option or contract to purchase, or other person having an
enforceable proprietary interest in such land.
EQUALIZED ASSESSED VALUE  Means the assessed value of a property
divided by the current average ratio of assessed to true value for the
municipality in which the property is situated, as determined in accordance
with sections 1, 5, and 6 of P.L. 1973, c. 123 (C. 54:1-35a through C.
54:1-35c).
GREEN BUILDING STRATEGIES  Means those strategies that minimize
the impact of development on the environment, and enhance the health,
safety and well-being of residents by producing durable, low-maintenance,
resource-efficient housing while making optimum use of existing
infrastructure and community services.
§ 97-53. Residential development fees.
a) Imposed fees.
i. Within all zoning districts, residential developers, except for
developers of the types of development specifically exempted
below, shall pay a fee of one and a half percent of the equalized
assessed value for residential development provided no increased
density is permitted.
ii. When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70d(5) (known as a "d" variance) has been permitted,
developers may be required to pay a development fee of six percent
of the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that may be
realized. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the
two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application,
the base density for the purposes of calculating the bonus
development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a
site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal one percent
of the equalized assessed value on the first two units, and the
specified higher percentage up to six percent of the equalized
assessed value for the two additional units, provided zoning on
the site has not changed during the two-year period preceding the
filing of such a variance application.
b) Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential
development

§ 97-54. Non-residential development fees.
i. Affordable housing developments and developments where the
developer has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of
affordable units shall be exempt from development fees.
ii. Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan
approval prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee
ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
iii. Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise
exempt from the development fee requirement. The development
fee shall be calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed
value of the improved structure.
iv. Developers of all residential housing demolished and replaced as a
result of a natural disaster or fire, shall be exempt from paying a
development fee.
a) Imposed fees.
i. Within all zoning districts, non-residential developers, except for

assessed value of the land and improvements, for all new nonresidential
construction on an unimproved lot or lots.
ii. Non-residential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to
two and one half (2.5) percent of the increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from any additions to existing structures to be used
for non-residential purposes.
iii. Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fees of two
and a half percent (2.5%) shall be calculated on the difference
between the equalized assessed value of the newly improved
structure, i.e. land and improvement, at the time final certificate of
occupancy is issued. If the calculation required under this section
results in a negative number, the non-residential development fee
shall be zero.

development
§ 97-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-54
1:375
§ 97-55. Collection procedures.
i. The non-residential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the two and a half (2.5%).
ii. The 2.5 percent fee shall not apply to an increase in equalized
assessed value resulting from alterations, change in use within
existing footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
iii. Non-residential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
non-residential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption Form". Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
iv. A developer of a non-residential development exempted from the
non-residential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46 shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies, and shall make the payment of the non-residential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the nonresidential
development, whichever is later.
v. If a property which was exempted from the collection of a nonresidential
development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt from
property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the fees
required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the termination
of the property tax exemption. Unpaid non-residential development
fees under these circumstances may be enforceable by the Borough
of Waldwick as a lien against the real property of the owner.
a) Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
staff to notify the construction official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit.
b) For non-residential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF "State of New Jersey Non-
Residential Development Certification/Exemption" to be completed as
per the instructions provided. The Developer of a non-residential
development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions
provided. The construction official shall verify the information
submitted by the non-residential developer as per the instructions
provided in the Form N-RDF. The Tax Assessor shall verify exemptions

g) Should the Borough of Waldwick fail to determine or notify the
developer of the amount of the development fee within 10 business days
of the request for final inspection, the developer may estimate the
amount due and pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute
process set forth in subsection b of section 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46 (C.
40:55D-8.6).
h) Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of
issuance of the building permit. The remaining portion shall be
collected at the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. The developer
shall be responsible for paying the difference between the fee
calculated at building permit and that determined at issuance of
certificate of occupancy.

dimensions of the recycling area shall be sufficient to accommodate
recycling bins or containers which are of adequate size and number, and
which are consistent with anticipated usage and with current methods
of collection in the area in which the project is located. The dimensions
of the recycling area and the bins or containers shall be determined in
consultation with the municipal recycling coordinator, and shall be

the municipal master plan, adopted pursuant to section 26 of P.L. 1987, c.
102.
A. As used in this article:
1. "Multifamily housing development" means a building containing
three or more dwelling units occupied or intended to be occupied
by persons living independently of each other, or a group of such
buildings;
§ 97-67.15 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-67.20
1:392
§ 97-68. Enforcement.
§ 97-68.1. Violations and penalties; civil actions.

C. The recycling area shall be well lit, and shall be safely and easily
accessible by recycling personnel and vehicles. Collection vehicles shall
be able to access the recycling area without interference from parked
cars or other obstacles. Reasonable measures shall be taken to protect

paper or cardboard, and which are located in an outdoor recycling area,
shall be equipped with a lid, or otherwise covered, so as to keep the
paper or cardboard dry.

dollars ($200) or to imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days,
and each parcel, plot or lot so disposed of shall be deemed a separate
violation.
B. In addition to the foregoing, if the streets in the subdivisions are not
such that a structure on said land in the subdivision would meet
requirements for a building permit under Section 3 of the Official Map
and Building Permit Act (1953), the municipality may institute and
maintain a civil action:
(1) For injunctive relief.
(2) To set aside and invalidate any conveyance made pursuant to such
contract or sale if a certificate of compliance has not been issued in
§ 97-67.20 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-68.1

§ 97-69.1. Application or provisions; variances.
These rules, regulations and standards shall be considered the minimum
requirements for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the Borough of Waldwick. Any action taken by the Planning
Board under the terms of this ordinance shall give primary consideration to
the above mentioned matters and to the welfare of the entire community.
However, if the subdivider or his/her agent can clearly demonstrate that by
reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness or shape of a specific piece
of property, or by reason of exceptional topographic conditions or physical
features uniquely affecting a specific piece of property, or by reason of an
extraordinary and exceptional situation uniquely affecting a specific piece
of property, the strict application would result in peculiar and exceptional
practical difficulties to, or exceptional undue hardship upon the developer
of such property; and where in an application or appeal relating to a specific
piece of property the purposes of this act would be advanced by deviation
from the land use and development code requirements and the benefits
of the deviation would substantially outweigh any detriment, the Planning
Board may permit such variance or variances as may be reasonable and
within the general purpose and intent of the rules, regulations and
standards established by this ordinance. In making its findings, as required
hereinbelow, the Planning Board shall take into account the nature of the
proposed use or the existing use of land in the vicinity, the number of
persons to reside or work in the proposed subdivision and the probable
effect of the proposed subdivision upon traffic conditions in the vicinity. No
variance shall be granted unless the Planning Board finds that:
accordance with Section 24 of Chapter 433 of the Laws of 1953,
but only if the municipality has a Planning Board or a committee
thereof with power to act and which:
(a) Meets regularly on a monthly or more frequent basis, and
(b) Whose governing body has adopted standards and procedures
in accordance with Section 20 of Chapter 433 of the Laws of
1953.
A. There are special circumstances or conditions affecting said property
such that the strict application of the provisions of this ordinance would
deprive the applicant of the reasonable use of his/her land.
B. The variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the applicant.
C. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare and quality of life or injurious to property in the area in which
said property is situated.
§ 97-68.1 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-69.2
1:394
§ 97-69.2. Withholding of business permits and certificates of
occupancy.
A. Wherever connections to public water supply mains and to a public
sewer system are not available on any lot shown on an approved plat, no
building permit for any structure involving or intending to involve
human occupancy shall be issued unless and until the Board of Health
has certified that proper sanitary facilities can be constructed and
maintained, and further that no certificate of occupancy indicating
conformity with the Land Use and Development Code and other
municipal ordinances shall be issued except where actual connections
to a public water main and public sanitary sewer are installed and ready
for use, until the local Board of Health has certified that the individual
sewage disposal system and private source of water supply has been
constructed in a proper manner, is adequate in capacity for the purpose
and is ready for service. A penalty for failure to conform should be
provided.
B. Supervision required. The Planning Board or the Board of Health,
either or both, shall require that before acceptance of the final plat or
final site plan for any major subdivision, the applicant and his/her
assigns agree in writing to furnish at his/her own expense acceptable
qualified supervision to insure completion of the project in accordance
with the plans in respect to all facilities, grading elevations, house
locations, location and installation of individual sewage disposal
facilities as location construction and elevations and any private
sources of water supply, or that said owner or his/her agents agree to
pay on the basis of a monthly bill the cost of supervision by an engineer
or other qualified person approved by the Planning Board and the
Board of Health and not in the employ of the said owner.
C. The Planning Board reserves the right to require the construction of
sanitary sewers, manholes and house connections even though at the
time it may not be feasible to connect to any trunk sewers, in which
case individual sewage disposal facilities conforming to the
requirements of the Board of Health shall also be installed.
D. Conformity with site plan. Wherever a site plan is filed with the
Planning Board prior to approval of a final plat, the applicant, for
himself and his/her assigns, must agree in writing to follow that plan in
all details unless all bodies or agencies who has approved the original
plan will approve in writing an amended plan.

design and source controls that prevent pollutants from being placed on
the site or from being exposed to stormwater. Source control plans
should be developed based upon physical site conditions and the origin,
nature, and the anticipated quantity or amount of potential pollutants.
Multiple stormwater management BMPs may be necessary to achieve
the established performance standards for water quality, quantity, and
groundwater recharge.
B. Purpose. It is the purpose of this ordinance to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls for "major
development," as defined in § 97-89.
C. Applicability.
1. This ordinance shall be applicable to all site plans and subdivisions
for the following major developments that require preliminary or
final site plan or subdivision review:
a. Non-residential major developments; and aspects of residential
major developments that are not preempted by the Residential
Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21.
2. This ordinance shall also be applicable to all major developments
undertaken by the Borough of Waldwick.
D. Compatibility with Other Permit and Ordinance Requirements.
Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant
to this ordinance are to be considered an integral part of development
approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not
relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or
approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule,
act, or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions
of this ordinance shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the
promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. This
ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other
ordinances, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law except
§ 97-87 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-88
1:403
§ 97-89. Definitions.
that, where any provision of this ordinance imposes restrictions
different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation,
or other provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher
standards shall control.

A. Design and Performance Standards for Stormwater Management
Measures.
§ 97-89 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-90
1:407
§ 97-91. Stormwater management requirements for major
development.
1. Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 97-91. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.
The standards in this ordinance apply only to new major
development and are intended to minimize the impact of
stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving
water bodies and maintain groundwater recharge. The standards
do not apply to new major development to the extent that
alternative design and performance standards are applicable under
a regional stormwater management plan or Water Quality
Management Plan adopted in accordance with Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 97-97.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department' Landscape Project or Natural Heritage
Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through 15.150,
particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys
muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of Sections 97-91F and 97-91G:
1. The construction of an underground utility line provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
2. The construction of an aboveground utility line provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
3. The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
requirements of Sections 97-91F and 97-91G may be obtained for the
enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad; or the
§ 97-90 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-91
1:408
construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided
that the following conditions are met:
1. The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
2. The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of Sections 97-91F and 97-91G to
the maximum extent practicable;
3. The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of Sections 97-91F and 97-91G, existing structures currently in use,
such as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
4. The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under D3 above within the
upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would provide
additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of Sections
97-91F and 97-91G that were not achievable on-site.
E. Nonstructural Stormwater Management Strategies.
1. To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 97-91F and
G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at § 97-91E to the design. The
applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated
into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not
feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to
incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management strategies
identified in § 97-91E2 below into the design of a particular project,
the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and provide a
basis for the contention.
2. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
a. Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
b. Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
c. Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
d. Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration" from preconstruction
to post construction. "Time of concentration" is
defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the
hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point
of interest within a watershed;
§ 97-91 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-91
1:409
e. Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading;
f. Minimize soil compaction;
g. Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages
retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the
use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides;
h. Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems
discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
i. Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site, in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
(1) Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 97-91E3 below;
(2) Site design features that help to prevent discharge of trash
and debris from drainage systems;
(3) Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
(4) When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
3. Site design features identified under § 97-91E2i(2) above shall
comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and
floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For exemptions to
this standard see § 97-91E3c below.
a. Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
(1) The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
(2) A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven (7.0) square
inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest
dimension.
§ 97-91 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-91
1:410
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer
bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces
include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways,
parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields,
open channels, and stormwater basin floors.
b. Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven (7.0) square inches, or be no
greater than two (2.0) inches across the smallest dimension.
c. This standard does not apply:
(1) Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
(2) Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 97-91G1 are conveyed through any device
(e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
(a) A rectangular space four and five-eighths inches long
and one and one-half inches wide (this option does not
apply for outfall netting facilities); or
(b) A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
(3) Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch (1") spacing between the bars,
to the elevation of the water quality design storm as
specified in § 97-91G1; or
(4) Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
4. Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in Sections 97-91F
and 97-91G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected
to a conservation restriction filed with the Bergen County Clerk's
office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
§ 97-91 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-91
1:411
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity.
5. Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 97-94A, or found on the Department's
website at www.njstormwater.org.
F. Erosion Control, Groundwater Recharge and Runoff Quantity
Standards.
1. This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
a. The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and
implementing rules.
b. The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
c. The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors
for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations
at § 97-92, either:
(a) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that the site and its stormwater management measures
maintain 100 percent of the average annual preconstruction
groundwater recharge volume for the site; or
(b) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that the increase of stormwater runoff volume from preconstruction
to post-construction for the 2-year storm is
infiltrated.
2. This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projects
within the "urban redevelopment area," or to projects subject to (3)
below.
3. The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
a. Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and commercial
developments where solvents and/or petroleum products are
loaded/unloaded, stored, or applied, areas where pesticides
are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas where hazardous
materials are expected to be present in greater than
"reportable quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas
§ 97-91 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-91
1:412
where recharge would be inconsistent with Department
approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan and
areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials, such as gas
stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and
b. Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material."
4. The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the
groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid adverse
hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic impacts include, but
are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high
water table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements,
or interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage
disposal systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
a. In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 97-92, complete one of the
following:
(1) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction
runoff hydrographs for the two, 10, and 100-year storm
events do not exceed, at any point in time, the preconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
(2) Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction
condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two, 10, and 100-year
storm events and that the increased volume or change in
timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage
at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the
analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected
land uses assuming full development under existing zoning
and land use ordinances in the drainage area;
(3) Design stormwater management measures so that the
post-construction peak runoff rates for the 2, 10 and 100
year storm events are 50, 75 and 80 percent, respectively,
of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The percentages
apply only to the post-construction stormwater runoff that
is attributable to the portion of the site on which the
proposed development or project is to be constructed. The
percentages shall not be applied to post-construction
stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard areas if the
increased volume of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damages below the point of discharge; or
§ 97-91 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-91
1:413
(4) In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with (1), (2) and (3) above shall only
be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff
could increase flood damages below the point of
discharge.
(5) Any application for a new "agricultural development" that
meets the definition of major development at § 97-89 shall
be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District
for review and approval in accordance with the
requirements of this section and any applicable Soil
Conservation District guidelines for stormwater runoff
quantity and erosion control.
G. Stormwater Runoff Quality Standards. Stormwater management
measures shall be designed to reduce the post-construction load of total
suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff by 80 percent of the
anticipated load from the developed site, expressed as an annual
average. Stormwater management measures shall only be required for
water quality control if an additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is
being proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS
does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under
a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey
Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A,
or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in
two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into account the
distribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as reflected in
Table
1. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into account the
implementation of non-structural and structural stormwater
management measures.

2. For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 97-94, or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 97-94. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
3. If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
80 percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the
following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B  (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs,
and
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff
from the subareas converge on site in which case the removal rate
can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted
average.
5. Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in Sections 97-91F and
97-91G.
6. Additional information and examples of stormwater quality BMPs
are contained in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual, which may be obtained from the address
identified in § 97-94.
7. In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4,
stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent
any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1.
8. Special water resource protection areas shall be established along
all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial
or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category
One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the
County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area.
These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality,
aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional
recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance,
and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category
One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as
follows:
§ 97-91 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-91
1:416
a. The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
(1) A 300-foot special water resource protection area shall be
provided on each side of the waterway, measured
perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank
outwards or from the centerline of the waterway where the
bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or
vegetation allowed to follow natural succession is
provided. (2) Encroachment within the designated special
water resource protection area under Subsection (1)
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or
centerline of the waterway where the bank is undefined.
All encroachments proposed under this subparagraph
shall be subject to review and approval by the Department.
b. All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through
the special water resource protection area and shall comply
with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards For
Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq.
c. If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the
special water resource protection area cannot comply with the
Standard For Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil
Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established
under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A.
4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance
with the requirements of the above standards may be placed
within the special water resource protection area, provided
that:
(1) Stabilization measures shall not be placed within 150 feet
of the Category One waterway;
(2) Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this
section shall achieve a 95 percent TSS post-construction
removal rate;
§ 97-91 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-91
1:417
§ 97-92. Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater
recharge.
(3) Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on
the receiving waterway;
(4) The encroachment shall only be allowed where the
applicant demonstrates that the functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection
area will be maintained to the maximum extent
practicable;
(5) A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the
appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation
District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures;
and
(6) All encroachments proposed under this section shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.
d. A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 97-91G8 has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to § 97-91G8
shall maintain or enhance the current functional value and
overall condition of the special water resource protection area
as defined in § 97-91G8a(1) above. In no case shall a stream
corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the Special
Water Resource Protection Area to less than 150 feet as
measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
e. Section 97-91G8 does not apply to the construction of one
individual single family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
1. The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
a. The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
§ 97-91 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-92
1:418
National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and
Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds
or superseding document; or
b. The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
2. For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction
condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at Section 5A1a and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at Section 5A1b. A runoff coefficient or
a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn,
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
3. In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or
culverts, that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
4. In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
5. If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
B. Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the
following:
1. The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method for
Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey,

A. Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as
follows:
1. Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
2. Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel
bars with one-inch (1") spacing between the bars to the elevation of
the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the
water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure
shall be spaced no greater than one-third (1/3) the width of the
diameter of the orifice or one-third (1/3) the width of the weir, with
a minimum spacing between bars of one-inch and a maximum
spacing between bars of six inches. In addition, the design of trash
racks must comply with the requirements of § 97-95.
3. Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion
resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
4. At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in
diameter.
5. Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the
minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at §
97-95.
6. Where tailwater will affect the hydraulic performance of a
stormwater management measure, the design engineer shall
include such effects in the measure's design.

that directs all marketing activities toward Housing Region 2 and
covers the period of deed restriction.
(3) The affirmative marketing plan shall provide a regional preference

period as the Borough of Waldwick elects to release the unit from
such requirements.
(2) The affordability control period for a restricted ownership unit shall
commence on the date the initial certified household takes title to
the unit.
(3) Prior to the issuance of the initial certificate of occupancy for a
restricted ownership unit and upon each successive sale during the
period of restricted ownership, the administrative agent shall
determine the restricted price for the unit and shall also determine
the nonrestricted, fair market value of the unit based on either an
appraisal or the unit's equalized assessed value without the
restrictions in place.

execute and deliver to the administrative agent a recapture note
obligating the purchaser (as well as the purchaser's heirs,

successors and assigns) to repay, upon the first nonexempt sale
after the unit's release from the requirements of this section, an

fair market value and its restricted price, and the recapture note
shall be secured by a recapture lien evidenced by a duly recorded
mortgage on the unit.

moderate-income purchasers and those paid by market
purchasers.

administrative agent to increase the maximum sales price for
the unit on the basis of capital improvements. Eligible capital
improvements shall be those that render the unit suitable for a
larger household or the addition of a bathroom.

purchasers to permit prompt occupancy of the units. All
such low-income units to be sold to moderate-income households
shall retain the required pricing and pricing restrictions for lowincome
units.

application and a showing of hardship, to lease the restricted unit
to another certified household for a period not to exceed one year.

restricted ownership unit when the household is a low-income
household or a moderate-income household, as applicable to the
unit, and the estimated monthly housing cost for the particular unit
(including principal, interest, taxes, homeowner and private
mortgage insurance and condominium or homeowner association
fees, as applicable) does not exceed 33% of the household's
certified monthly income.

during a control period neither an owner nor a lender shall at any
time cause or permit the total indebtedness secured by a restricted
ownership unit to exceed 95% of the maximum allowable resale
price of that unit, as such price is determined by the administrative
agent in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.6(b).
O. Capital improvements to ownership units.

§ 97-120 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-120

that are permanently affixed to the unit or were included when the

in the maximum allowable resale price. Other items may be sold to
the purchaser at a reasonable price that has been approved by the
administrative agent at the time of the signing of the agreement to
purchase. The purchase of central air conditioning installed
subsequent to the initial sale of the unit and not included in the
base price may be made a condition of the unit resale provided the
price, which shall be subject to ten-year, straight-line depreciation,
has been approved by the administrative agent. Unless otherwise
approved by the administrative agent, the purchase of any property
other than central air conditioning shall not be made a condition of
the unit resale. The owner and the purchaser must personally
certify at the time of closing that no unapproved transfer of funds
for the purpose of selling and receiving property has taken place at
the time of or as a condition of resale.

the requirements of N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.1, as may be amended and
supplemented, except that, for any units approved after October
13, 2016, such controls shall be for at least 50 years, or until such
time after the initial fifty-year period as the Borough of Waldwick
elects to release the unit from such requirements. For new projects
receiving nine-percent low-income housing tax credits, a control
period of not less than a thirty-year compliance period plus a
fifteen-year extended use period shall be required.
(2) Deeds of all real property that include restricted rental units shall
contain deed restriction language. The deed restriction shall have
priority over all mortgages on the property, and the deed
restriction shall be filed by the developer or seller with the records
office of the County of Bergen. The deed shall also identify each
affordable unit by apartment number and/or address and whether
that unit is designated as a very low, low or moderate income unit.
Neither the unit nor its affordability designation shall change
throughout the term of the deed restriction. A copy of the filed
document shall be provided to the administrative agent within 30
days of the receipt of a certificate of occupancy.

(except, in the case of units in an assisted living residence, to cover
the customary charges for food and services) without the express
written approval of the administrative agent.
(3) Application fees (including the charge for any credit check) shall
not exceed 5% of the monthly rent of the applicable restricted unit
and shall be payable to the administrative agent to be applied to
the costs of administering the controls applicable to the unit as set
forth in this section.
(4) No rent control ordinance or other pricing restriction shall be
applicable to either the market units or the affordable units in any
development in which at least 15% of the total number of dwelling
units are restricted rental units in compliance with this section.
R. Tenant income eligibility.

5:80-26.13, as may be amended and supplemented, and shall be

including but not limited to foreclosure, tenant eviction, municipal

all sums due under a mortgage, recoupment of any funds from a
sale in the violation of the regulations, injunctive relief to prevent
further violation of the regulations, entry on the premises, and
specific performance.
(2) After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer
or tenant of a low- or moderate-income unit and advising the owner,
developer or tenant of the penalties for such violations, the
municipality may take the following action against the owner,
developer or tenant for any violation that remains uncured for a
period of 60 days after service of the written notice:
(a) The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A.
2A:58-11 alleging a violation, or violations, of the regulations
§ 97-120 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-120
1:495
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer
or tenant is found by the court to have violated any provision of
the regulations governing affordable housing units the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the
following penalties, at the discretion of the court:
[1] A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both. Each and every day
that the violation continues or exists shall be considered a
separate and specific violation of these provisions and not
as a continuing offense;
[2] In the case of an owner who has rented his/her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units, payment into the
Borough of Waldwick Affordable Housing Trust Fund of
the gross amount of rent illegally the collected;
[3] In the case of an owner who has rented his/her low- or
moderate-income unit in violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units, payment of an
innocent tenant's reasonable relocation costs, as
determined by the court.
(b) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment, which would result in the termination of
the owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of
a mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be enforceable as
if the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase
money mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the lowand
moderate-income unit.
(3) Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at which
time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating owner shall
be sold at a sale price which is not less than the amount necessary
to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase money mortgage and
prior liens and the costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred
by the municipality, including attorney's fees. The violating owner
shall have the right to possession terminated as well as the title
conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(4) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the
first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior liens upon the
low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if any, shall be applied
to reimburse the municipality for any and all costs and expenses
incurred in connection with either the court action resulting in the
judgment of violation or the Sheriff's sale. In the event that the
proceeds from the Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the
municipality in full as aforesaid, the violating owner shall be
personally responsible for and to the extent of such deficiency, in
§ 97-120 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-120
1:496
addition to any and all costs incurred by the municipality in
connection with collecting such deficiency. In the event that a
surplus remains after satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if
any, shall be placed in escrow by the municipality for the owner and
shall be held in such escrow for a maximum period of two years
or until such earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such balance
within the two-year period shall automatically result in a forfeiture
of such balance to the municipality. Any interest accrued or earned
on such balance while being held in escrow shall belong to and
shall be paid to the municipality, whether such balance shall be
paid to the owner or forfeited to the municipality.
(5) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations
governing affordable housing units shall not extinguish the
restrictions of the regulations governing affordable housing units
as the same apply to the low- and moderate-income unit. Title shall
be conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the
restrictions and provisions of the regulations governing the
affordable housing unit. The owner determined to be in violation of
the provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession were
taken by means of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any
right of redemption.
(6) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage and
any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the low- and
moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase money
mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating owner with
an amount equal to the difference between the first purchase
money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the enforcement
proceedings, including legal fees and the maximum resale price for
which the low- and moderate-income unit could have been sold
under the terms of the regulations governing affordable housing
units. This excess shall be treated in the same manner as the excess
which would have been realized from an actual sale as previously
described.
(7) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold at
the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall obligate the
owner to accept an offer to purchase from any qualified purchaser
which may be referred to the owner by the municipality, with such
offer to purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the
low- and moderate-income unit as permitted by the regulations
governing affordable housing units.
(8) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for
complying with the terms and restrictions of governing affordable
housing units until such time as title is conveyed from the owner.

movements will intersect the public streets at an angle as near
to ninety degrees (90º) as the site conditions will permit and in
no case shall be less than sixty degrees (60º).
(5) Fire zones. Parking areas shall be so arranged as to provide
adequate access to all buildings in case of fire or other
emergencies. No parking shall be allowed within thirty (30) feet of
the outer walls of the structure or within such other adequate
distances as the Planning Board in consultation with the Borough
Fire Officials may approve. The owner of the site shall post
adequate signs and provide pavement marking, approved by the
Planning Board, prohibiting parking in areas designated as fire
zones.
(6) Interior traffic islands. All parking areas for thirty (30) or more
vehicles shall contain grassed or landscaped island areas of at least
eight (8) feet in width separating rows of proposed head-on parking
spaces. Such interior traffic islands shall be spread throughout the
parking area to control traffic movement in accordance with a site
§ 97-123.7 WALDWICK BOROUGH CODE § 97-123.7
1:534
plan approved by the Planning Board. Interior traffic islands shall
occupy a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the area, formed by
the outer perimeter of the paved parking lot. Interior traffic islands
shall be landscaped and contain shade trees as required under
Subsection C(7).
(7) Landscaping. All portions of the property not used for off-street
parking shall be attractively landscaped with grass lawns, trees
and shrubs as approved by the Planning Board. Off-street parking
areas providing parking for twenty (20) or more vehicles shall be

commercial, industrial and multifamily uses shall provide an
average lighting level of two-tenths (0.2) horizontal footcandles of
illumination during the hours between sunset and sunrise when the
use is in operation. Adequate shielding shall be provided by
commercial and industrial uses to protect adjacent residential
zones from the glare from such illumination and from that of
automobile headlights.
(9) Location of parking. Parking areas may be located in any yard
space for commercial uses and in any yard but the front yard for
other uses, but shall not be closer than five (5) feet to any street or
property line.
(10) Pavement markings. All parking and loading spaces shall be
appropriately marked with painted lines. Parking spaces shall be
delineated by hairpin or double-line markings. Parking stalls
delineated by hairpin markings shall be measured from the
centerline of each side to determine width. Traffic flow indicators
shall also be marked on the pavement as specified in the approved
site plan. All pavement markings shall be adequately maintained.
(11) Screening. All off-street parking areas shall be effectively screened
on any side which adjoins or faces any residential use or zone, by a
fence, wall or landscaped buffer area. Commercial areas shall be
required to be screened from a residential use or zone by a fence
for the purpose of protecting the residential property from litter,
debris, light and glare and other such nuisances that would disturb
peaceful possession. A fence or wall six (6) feet in height,
containing no advertising, shall be maintained in good condition by
the owner and tenant of the property. Fencing used shall be of
closed post picket solid fence containing no more than twenty-five
§ 97-123.7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-123.7
1:535
percent (25%) open space. The Planning Board may substitute
a hedge or other natural landscaping for the required fence or
wall. The fence as required by this section may be waived by the
Planning Board if, in the Board's judgment, because of topographic
or other unusual conditions, said fence is not necessary to screen
adjoining residential property. Where parking is located in the front
yard, the Planning Board may require construction of a landscaped
berm up to a height of five (5) feet with slopes at a ratio of not less
than two to one (2:1).
(12) Setbacks. Off-street parking areas shall be separated from the
street right-of-way or other property lines by a minimum setback of
five (5) feet to prevent any part of a vehicle from overhanging
street or property lines.

5. If a premise contains walls facing more than street or other
property usages, the sign area(s) for each building wall will be
computed separately for each building wall facing a different
street. The sign area(s) thus calculated may then be applied to

6. Every sign permitted by this ordinance must be kept in good
condition and repair. When any sign become insecure, in danger of
falling, or is otherwise deemed unsafe by the Municipal Building
Sub-Code Official responsible for the maintenance of public safety,
or if any sign shall be unlawfully installed, erected, or maintained
in violation of any of the provisions of this ordinance, the owner
thereof or the person or firm using same shall, upon written notice
by the Building Sub-Code Official forthwith in the case of
immediate danger and in any case within not more than ten (10)
days, make such sign conform to the provisions of this ordinance,
or shall remove it. If within ten (10) days, the order is not complied

to the extreme limits of the sign frame or backdrop. Sign area
shall also include the ground structure or any decoration which
is an integral part of the sign, but excluding supports.

1. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish general guidelines
for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas. The
goals of this section is to: (1) protect residential areas and land uses
from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; (2) encourage
the location of towers in non-residential areas; (3) minimize the total
number of towers throughout the community; (4) strongly encourage
the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather
than construction of additional single-use towers; (5) encourage users
of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas
where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; (6) encourage
users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes
the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful
design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging
techniques; (7) enhance the ability of the providers of
telecommunications services to provide such services to the community
quickly, effectively, and efficiently; (8) consider the public health and
safety of communication towers; and (9) avoid potential damage to
adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful
siting of tower structures. In furtherance of these goals, the Borough of
Waldwick shall give due consideration to the Borough of Waldwick's
master plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally
sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and
antennas.

by this ordinance shall bring such towers and antennas into
compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six
(6) months of the effective date of such standards and regulations,
unless a different compliance schedule is mandated by the
controlling state or federal agency. Failure to bring towers and
antennas into compliance with such revised standards and
regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or
antenna at the owner's expense.
(g) Building Codes; Safety Standards. To ensure the structural
integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is
maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable
state or local building codes and the applicable standards for
towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association,
as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Borough of
Waldwick concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes
and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property,
then upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the
owner shall have thirty (30) days to bring such tower into
compliance with such standards. Failure to bring such tower into
compliance within said thirty (30) days shall constitute grounds for
the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense.

(2) Factors Considered in Granting Conditional Use Permits for
Towers. In addition to any standards for consideration of
conditional use permit applications pursuant to § 97-124 of this
chapter, the Planning Board shall consider the following
factors in determining whether to issue a conditional use
permit, although the Planning Board may waive or reduce the
burden on the applicant of one or more of these criteria if the
Planning Board concludes that the goals of this ordinance are
better served thereby:
(i) Height of the proposed tower;
(ii) Proximity of the tower to residential structures and
residential district boundaries;
(iii) Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties;
(iv) Surrounding topography;
(v) Surrounding tree coverage and foliage;
(vi) Design of the tower, with particular reference to design
characteristics that have the effect of reducing or
eliminating visual obtrusiveness;

(viii) Availability of suitable existing towers, other structures,
or alternative technologies not requiring the use of towers
or structures, as discussed in Section 7(b)(3) of this
ordinance.
(3) Availability of Suitable Existing Towers, Other Structures, or
Alternative Technology. No new tower shall be permitted
unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable
satisfaction of the Planning Board that no existing tower,
structure or alternative technology that does not require the
use of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's
proposed antenna. An applicant shall submit information
requested by the Planning Board related to the availability of
suitable existing towers, other structures or alternative
technology. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no
existing tower, structure or alternative technology can
accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may consist of
any of the following (although nothing should be construed to
§ 97-123.12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 97-123.12
1:573
infer that meeting one, some, or all of the following shall entitle
the applicant to approval):
(i) No existing towers or structures are located within the
geographic area which meet applicant's engineering
requirements.
(ii) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to
meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(iii) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient
structural strength to support applicants proposed
antenna and related equipment.
(iv) The applicants proposed antenna would cause
electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the
existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the
existing towers or structures would cause interference
with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(v) The fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the
owner in order to share an existing tower or structure or to
adapt an existing tower or structure for sharing are
unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development
are presumed to be unreasonable.
(vi) The applicant demonstrates that there are other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures
unsuitable.
(vii) The applicant demonstrates that an alternative technology
that does not require the use of towers or structures, such
as a cable micro-cell network using multiple low-powered
transmitters/receivers attached to a wire line system, is
unsuitable. Costs of alternative technology that exceed
new tower or antenna development shall not be presumed
to render the technology unsuitable.
(4) Setbacks. The following setback requirements shall apply to all
towers for which a conditional use permit is required;
provided, however, that the Planning Board may reduce the
standard setback requirements if the goals of this ordinance
would be better served thereby:
