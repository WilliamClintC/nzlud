DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION
§ 14-1. Legislative intent. [Amended 11-17-1997 by L.L. No. 9-1997]
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection for
those individuals serving the Village of Suffern from losses which may be
brought against them in their individual capacity for actions taken while
in the performance of their official duties and responsibilities. In enacting
this chapter, the Board of Trustees finds that the State of New York has
enacted similar provisions for the legal and financial security of its officers
and employees and further finds that such security is also required for local
personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Board of Trustees does not
intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right or responsibility of
the Village or its employees with regard to indemnification or legal defense.
This chapter is intended to implement and supplement the provisions of § 18
of the Public Officers Law.
§ 14-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, unless the context otherwise requires, the following
terms shall have the meanings indicated:
EMPLOYEE  Any person holding a position by election, appointment
or employment in the service of the Village of Suffern, whether or not
compensated, or a volunteer expressly authorized to participate in a
municipally sponsored volunteer program, but shall not include an
independent contractor. The term "employee" shall include a former
employee or his estate or judicially appointed personal representative.
§ 14-3. Right to legal counsel.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 14-5 of this
chapter, the Village shall provide for the defense of the employee in any
civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any
alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting within the scope of his
public employment or duties or which is brought to enforce a provision
of 42 U.S.C. § 1981 or 42 U.S.C. § 1983. This duty to provide for a
defense shall not arise where such civil action or proceeding is brought
by or on behalf of the Village of Suffern.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in Subsection A of this section, the
employee shall be entitled to be represented by the Village Attorney;
provided, however, that the employee shall be entitled to
representation by private counsel of his choice in any civil judicial
proceeding whenever the Village Attorney determines, based upon his
investigation and review of the facts and circumstances of the case, that
representation by the Village Attorney would be inappropriate or
whenever a court of competent jurisdiction, upon appropriate motion or
§ 10-2 SUFFERN CODE § 14-3
1:12
§ 14-4. Settlement of claim.
by a special proceeding, determines that a conflict of interest exists and
that the employee is entitled to be represented by private counsel of
his choice. The Village Attorney shall notify the employee, in writing,
of such determination that the employee is entitled to be represented
by private counsel of his choice. The Village Attorney may require, as a
condition to payment of the fees and expenses of such representation,
that appropriate groups of such employees be represented by the same
counsel. If the employee or group of employees is entitled to
representation by private counsel under the provisions of this section,
the Village Attorney shall so certify to the Board of Trustees.
Reasonable attorneys' fees and litigation expenses shall be paid by the
Village to such private counsel from time to time during the pendency
of the civil action or proceeding, subject to certification that the
employee is entitled to representation under the terms and conditions
of this section by the head of the department, commission, division,
office or agency in which such employee is employed and upon the
audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer. Any dispute with respect to
representation of multiple employees by a single counsel or the amount
of litigation expenses or the reasonableness of attorneys' fees shall be
resolved by the court upon motion or by way of a special proceeding.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Village Attorney as required by § 14-5 of this chapter, the Attorney shall
take the necessary steps, including the retention of private counsel
under the terms and conditions provided in Subsection B of this section,
on behalf of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment pending
resolution of any question pertaining to the obligation to provide for a
defense.
A. The Village shall indemnify and save harmless its employees in the
amount of any judgment obtained against such employees in any state
or federal court or in the amount of any settlement of a claim, including
punitive or exemplary damages, provided that the act or omission from
which such judgment or settlement arose occurred while the employee
was acting within the scope of his public employment or duties. The
duty to indemnify and save harmless prescribed by this section shall not
arise where the injury or damage resulted from intentional wrongdoing
or recklessness on the part of the employee. [Amended 11-17-1997
by L.L. No. 9-1997]
B. An employee represented by private counsel shall cause to be
submitted to the Board of Trustees any proposed settlement which may
be subject to indemnification by the Village, and, if not inconsistent
with the provisions of this section, the Mayor shall certify such
settlement and submit such settlement and certification to the Village
Attorney. The Attorney shall review such proposed settlement as to
form and amount and shall give his approval if, in his judgment, the
settlement is in the best interest of the Village. Nothing in this
§ 14-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 14-4
1:13
§ 14-5. Conditions.
The duty to defend or indemnify and save harmless provided by this chapter
shall be conditioned upon delivery to the Village Attorney or his assistant,
at his office, by the employee of the original or a copy of any summons,
complaint, process, notice, demand or pleading within five days after he
is served with such document and the full cooperation of the employee in
the defense of such action or proceeding and in defense of any action or
proceeding against the Village based upon the same act or omission and
in the prosecution of any appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request
by the employee that the Village provide for his defense pursuant to this
chapter.
§ 14-6. Effect on other parties and state law.
The benefits of this chapter shall inure only to employees as defined herein
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall any
provision of this chapter be construed to affect, alter or repeal any provision
of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 14-7. Rights of insurers.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
§ 14-8. Applicability.
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all actions and proceedings
pending upon the effective date thereof or thereafter instituted.
§ 14-9. Effect on other immunity or right to defense and
indemnification.
Except as otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the provisions of
this chapter shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify,
abrogate or restrict any immunity available to or conferred upon any unit,
entity, officer or employee of the Village or any right to defense and/or
subsection shall be construed to authorize the Village to indemnify
or save harmless an employee with respect to a settlement not so
reviewed and approved by the Village Attorney.
C. Upon entry of a final judgment against the employee or upon the
settlement of the claim, the employee shall cause to be served a copy of
such judgment or settlement, personally or by certified or registered
mail, within 30 days of the date of entry or settlement, upon the Mayor;
and if not inconsistent with the provisions of this section, such
judgment or settlement shall be certified for payment by such Mayor. If
the Attorney concurs in such certification, the judgment or settlement
shall be paid upon the audit and warrant of the Village Treasurer.

ELECTIONS
§ 18-1. Runoff election.
In the event that more eligible candidates than the number to be elected to
the same Village office receive an equal number of votes, which number of
votes would be sufficient to elect a candidate to the Village office in question
had candidates not received an equal number of votes, a runoff election
shall be held to determine which of such persons shall be elected.
§ 18-2. Waiver; election by lot.
Such runoff may be waived and the selection of the persons elected shall be
made by lot if each person who shall have received an equal number of votes
shall file with the Village Clerk within two days after the final certification
of such tie result a written and signed notice of consent that such selection
be made by lot.

§ 22-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Ethics in Government Law of
the Village of Suffern" (repealing and replacing the former Chapter 22 of
the Code of Ethics of the Village of Suffern originally adopted February 8,
1971).
§ 14-9 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 22-2
1:15
§ 22-2. Legislative intent.
In a democracy, government should be open, accessible, equitable and
efficient. Democratic government requires that elected officials be
independent, impartial and responsible to the people. Government
decisions and policy must be made through the appropriate channels of
government structure. Public office must not be used or be perceived
for personal gain. The public must have confidence in the integrity of
its government. In order to strengthen the democratic operation of the
Village of Suffern and to enhance public trust in that government, this code
requires disclosure of financial interests that may influence or be perceived
to influence the actions of elected officials, covered employees or Village
employees. Elected officials, covered employees or Village employees hold
office for the benefit of the public, and their conduct must be of the highest
standard. It is of the utmost importance that all individuals covered by that
law must be seen to be acting solely in the public interest. Therefore, it is
the intent of this legislation to:
§ 22-3. Scope and applicability.
A. Establish high standards of ethical conduct for elected officials, covered
employees and Village employees.
B. Afford elected officials, covered employees and Village employees clear
guidance to such standards.
C. Promote public confidence in the integrity of Village government.
D. Require disclosure of financial interests that may influence or be
perceived to influence the actions of elected officials, candidates for
elected office and covered employees.
E. Facilitate consideration of potential problems before they arise,
minimize unwarranted suspicion and enhance the accountability of
government to the people.
A. Nothing contained in this chapter shall be deemed to supersede the
provisions of §§ 800, 801, 802, 803 and 809 of the General Municipal
Law, but rather this chapter is deemed supplementary thereto.
However, should a higher standard of disclosure of conflict of interest
be required by this chapter, then the provisions of this chapter shall
govern.
B. All other legal requirements pertaining to the conduct of elected
officials, covered employees and Village employees shall not be deemed
to have been superseded by this chapter, including but not limited to
rules of any state or county agency relating to licensing and discipline
and any other applicable disciplinary codes.

cause or undue hardship. Such rules or regulations shall provide for a
date beyond which, in all cases of justifiable cause or undue hardship,
no further extension of time will be granted.

financial disclosure to request an exemption from any requirement to
report one or more items of information which pertain to such person's

of members of the Board without vacancy that the reporting individual's
spouse, on his or her own behalf or on behalf of an unemancipated
child, objects to providing the information necessary to make such
disclosure, and that the information which would otherwise be required
to be reported will have no material bearing on the discharge of the
reporting person's official duties.
N. Upon written request from any person who is subject to the jurisdiction
of the Board, the Board shall render advisory opinions on the
requirements of the provisions of this chapter. An opinion rendered by
the Board, until and unless amended or revoked, shall be binding on the
Board in any subsequent proceeding concerning the person who
requested the opinion and who acted in good faith unless material facts
were omitted or misstated by the person in the request for an opinion.
Such opinion may also be relied upon by such person and may be
introduced and shall be a defense in any criminal or civil action. Such
request and any such opinions shall be confidential.
O. If a person required to file a financial disclosure statement with the
Board has failed to file a disclosure statement or has filed a deficient
statement, the Board shall notify the reporting person, in writing, state
the failure to file or detail the deficiency, provide the person with a
fifteen-day period to cure the deficiency and advise the person of the
penalties for failure to comply with the reporting requirements. Such
notice shall be confidential. If the person fails to make such filing or
fails to cure the deficiency within the specified time period, the Board
shall send a notice of delinquency to the reporting person and, in the
case of a covered employee, to the appointing authority for such
person. Such notice shall be available for public inspection.
P. If a reporting person has filed a statement which reveals a possible
violation of the Code of Ethics of this chapter or the Board receives a
sworn complaint alleging such a violation or if the Board determines on

1:23
§ 22-8. Penalties for offenses; enforcement.
its own initiative to investigate a possible or alleged violation, the Board
shall notify the reporting person, in writing, describe the possible or
alleged violation of such Code of Ethics and provide the person with a
fifteen-day period in which to submit a written response setting forth
information relating to the activities cited as a possible or alleged
violation of law. If the Board thereafter makes a determination that
further inquiry is justified, it shall give the reporting person an
opportunity to be heard. The Board shall also inform the reporting
person of its rules regarding the conduct of adjudicatory proceedings
and the due process procedural mechanisms available to such
individual. If the Board determines at any stage of the proceeding that
there is no violation or that any potential conflict of interest violation
has been rectified, it shall so advise the reporting person and the
complainant, if any. All the foregoing proceedings shall be confidential.
If the Board determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that
a violation has occurred, it shall send notice of reasonable cause to
the reporting person, to the complainant, if any, and, in the case of a
covered employee, to the appointing authority for such person. Such
notice shall be available for public inspection.
Q. The Board shall adopt rules governing the conduct of adjudicatory
proceedings relating to the assessment of civil penalties herein
authorized. Such rules shall provide for due process procedural
mechanisms substantially similar to those set forth in Article 3 of the
State Administrative Procedure Act, but such mechanisms need not be
identical in terms or scope. Assessment of a civil penalty shall be final
unless modified, suspended or vacated within 30 days of imposition
and, upon becoming final, shall be subject to review at the instance of
the affected reporting individual in a proceeding commenced against
the appropriate body pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules.
R. The Board shall conduct any investigation necessary to carry out the
provisions of this chapter. Pursuant to this power and duty, the Board
may administer oaths or affirmations, subpoena witnesses, compel their
attendance and require the production of any books or records which it
may deem relevant or material.
S. All decisions of the Board not otherwise required to be kept confidential
shall be printed and made public within 30 days after their decision and
shall be filed with the Village Clerk and shall be available for public
inspection during regular business hours.

1:24

of this chapter shall be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor as that term is
defined in the New York State Penal Law.
C. An elected official, covered employee or candidate for elected office
who knowingly and willfully fails to file an annual statement of financial
disclosure or who knowingly and willfully, with intent to deceive, makes
a false statement or gives information which such individual knows to
be false on such statement of financial disclosure filed pursuant to
§ 22-6 of this chapter shall be assessed a civil penalty in an amount not
to exceed $10,000. The Board may, in lieu of a civil penalty, refer a
violation to the appropriate prosecutor and, upon such conviction, but
only after such referral, such violation shall be punishable as a Class A
misdemeanor. A civil penalty for false filing may not be imposed
hereunder in the event that a category of value or amount reported
hereunder is incorrect, unless such reported information is falsely
understated. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the
contrary, no other penalty, civil or criminal, may be imposed for a failure
to file or for a false filing of such statement, except that the Board may
impose disciplinary action as otherwise provided by law.
D. In the event that a civil penalty assessed by the Board shall become
final and shall not be reviewed pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil
Practice Law and Rules or, if so reviewed such civil penalty shall be
sustained or modified and, as so modified, sustained in part or, if after
referral to the appropriate prosecutor by the Board the reporting
person shall be convicted, the Board is hereby directed to review the
facts and, if appropriate, to file appropriate disciplinary charges and to
impose disciplinary action as provided by law.

ALARM SYSTEMS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Noise  See Ch. 175.
§ 69-1. Legislative intent.
There have been reported to the Board of Trustees by the Volunteer Fire
Department and Police Department extraordinary numbers of false alarms
emanating from automated devices. These false alarms unnecessarily
require that our police and firemen respond in an emergency fashion to
signals which should not have been created in the first place, depriving the
citizens of this Village from the sorely needed services of our emergency
forces and exposing the emergency volunteers to unnecessary hazards and
risks. Therefore, it is the intent of this chapter to provide a mechanism
whereby those responsible for the creation of these false alarms are dealt
with in an appropriate fashion. It is not the intent to discourage the use
of automated equipment, but rather to encourage the use of automated
equipment that fulfills its intended function.
(b) Placed on the porch or covered entranceway of a house or
building on said property, provided that it shall be wrapped,
bound, lockfolded or enclosed so as to prevent the same from
being blown, scattered or fragmented by the action of the

(c) Placed within the outer door to the premises or in the door
jamb or door handle.
B. No person shall place or cause to be placed any unsolicited newspaper,
advertising matter, newspaper or campaign material on any motor
vehicle. This subsection shall not apply to the issuance of any traffic
ticket or other notice permitted or required by law.

For the purpose of this chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
ALARM DEVICE  A mechanical, electrical or electronic device which,
when activated, will transmit a signal which is intended to create a response
from either a fire department or police department or other emergency
service, whether or not the signal generated is audible, visible or electronic
and whether such signal is automatic or otherwise.
ALARM USER  Any person, firm, corporation or business entity upon
whose premises an alarm device is installed or operating.
FALSE ALARM  A signal transmitted to either the Fire or Police
Department indicating that a fire or criminal act or emergency is occurring
when, in fact, neither a criminal act nor fire nor emergency is occurring.
§ 69-3. False alarms. [Amended 6-5-2006 by L.L. No. 5-2006]
It shall be unlawful for any alarm user to permit or allow, whether
intentionally or unintentionally or whether due to malefaction or otherwise,
an alarm device to signal a false alarm. The Fire Inspector, the Code
Enforcement Officer or the Police Department of the Village of Suffern is
authorized to issue a warning or an appearance ticket upon the occurence
of a false alarm.
§ 69-4. Penalties for offenses.
Any person convicted of a violation of this chapter within one year after the

Registration of Vacant Buildings
§ 101-1. Legislative findings and purpose.
It is the finding of the Board of Trustees that buildings which remain vacant
are unsightly and unsafe and have a negative effect on their surroundings.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish a program for identifying and
registering vacant buildings; to determine the responsibilities of owners
of vacant buildings and structures; and to speed the rehabilitation of the
vacant properties.
§ 101-2. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, the following terms shall, for the
purpose of this article, have the meanings indicated in this section:
EMERGENCY SITUATION  Where the condition of a building, structure,
or any part thereof is an imminent, immediate, and substantial danger to the
health or safety of occupants, emergency responders, and/or the general
public. Such conditions include, but are not limited to, fire hazards, falling
or dilapidated buildings, structures, or any part thereof, loss of significant
water, heat, ventilation, or a lack of sanitary conditions.
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER  A duly authorized representative of the
Building Department, including the Building Inspector, Code Enforcement
Officer and their assistants or designees.

annual vacant building fee in accordance with the rates established

diminish the owner's right to insist upon the procurement of a search
warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction by the Building Department
in order to enable such inspection, and the Enforcement Officer shall be
required to obtain a search warrant whenever an owner refuses to permit
a warrantless inspection of the premises after having been advised of his

emergency, this section will not apply.

shall also provide the fees collected, penalties assessed and an enumeration
of buildings/properties known not to be in current compliance.
(5) If the owner of a vacant building fails to register and pay the fees in
a timely manner, then the owner will be subject to the penalty set
forth in § 101-7.

as set forth in § 101-3H are to be delivered, by mail or in person, to

ARTICLE I
Statutory Authorization and Purpose
§ 141-1. Findings.
The Board of Trustees of the Village of Suffern finds that the potential
and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the
residents of the Village of Suffern and that such damages may include:
destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities,
both publicly and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.

§ 141-4. Definitions and word usage.
A. Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.
B. As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
APPEAL  A request for a review of the local administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a
variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percentor-
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one
to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain
within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A,
AE, AH, AO, A1-A30, A99, V, VO, VE, or VI-V30. It is also commonly
referred to as the "base floodplain" or "one-hundred-year floodplain."
For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special
flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING  See "structure."
CELLAR  Has the same meaning as "basement."
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor,
18 inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside
of the lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed
area, which may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must
be equal to or above the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed
crawl space area shall be properly vented to allow for the equalization
of hydrostatic forces which would be experienced during periods of
flooding.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
§ 141-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 141-4
1:115
ELEVATED BUILDING  A nonbasement building i) built, in the case
of a building in Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, to
have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones
V1-30, VE, or V, to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure
member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means
of pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the
flow of the water and ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the
structural integrity of the building during a flood of up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In the case of Zones A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C,
X, or D, "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means
of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to
facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. In the case of Zones
V1-V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building otherwise
meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower
area is enclosed by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal
standards.
FEDERAL EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AGENCY  The federal
agency that administers the National Flood Insurance Program.
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM)  An official map

Agency as part of a riverine community's Flood Insurance Study. The
FBFM delineates a regulatory floodway along watercourses studied in
detail in the Flood Insurance Study.
FLOOD ELEVATION STUDY  An examination, evaluation and
determination of the flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding
water surface elevations, or an examination, evaluation and
determination of flood-related erosion hazards.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP (FHBM)  An official map of a
community, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
where the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard have been
designated as Zone A but no flood elevations are provided.

in this community for the purpose of protecting its citizens from increased
flood hazards and insuring that new development is constructed in a
manner that minimizes its exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to
undertake any development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown
on the Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 141-6, without a valid
floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall be made on
forms furnished by the local administrator and may include, but not be
limited to, plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature,
location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or
proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, and drainage facilities; and
the location of the foregoing.
§ 141-13. Floodplain development permit: fees.
All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be accompanied
by an application fee of $50. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible
for reimbursing the Village of Suffern for any additional costs necessary for
review, inspection and approval of this project. The local administrator may
require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional costs.
§ 141-14. Application for permit.
The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permitee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any new
or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be floodproofed.
Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the structure, the
permitee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer or surveyor.
§ 141-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 141-14
1:123
§ 141-15. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the
following:
C. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 141-17C, Utilities.
D. A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that any
nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the floodproofing
criteria in § 141-17E, Nonresidential structures.
E. A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or
relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by a
licensed professional engineer must be submitted that demonstrate
that the altered or relocated segment will provide equal or greater
conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 141-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
F. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
G. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 141-14, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction Standards, and, in
particular, § 141-16A, Subdivision proposals.
§ 141-14 SUFFERN CODE § 141-15
1:124
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination.
(a) If the proposed development may result in physical damage to
any other property or fails to meet the requirements of Article
V, Construction Standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the

ARTICLE VI
Variance Procedure
§ 141-18. Appeals Board.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals, as established by the Village of Suffern,
shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
B. The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals when it is
alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination
made by the local administrator in the enforcement or administration of
this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals may
appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the
Civil Practice Law and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards
specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
§ 141-18 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 141-18
1:135
§ 141-19. Conditions for variances.
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of § 141-18D and the purposes of this
chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of
this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood level, providing the items in
§ 141-18D(1) through (12) have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification required for
issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
§ 141-18 SUFFERN CODE § 141-19
1:136
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Notice.
(1) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written
notice over the signature of a community official that:
(a) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the
base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage; and
(b) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property.
(2) Such notification shall be maintained with the record of all variance
actions as required in § 141-15H.

Container Districts
[Adopted 7-18-1988 by L.L. No. 3-1988]
§ 150-10. Intent; classification of districts. [Amended 5-17-1993 by
L.L. No. 3-1993]
It is the intention of the Village of Suffern by the adoption of this article
to provide for a fair and equitable method of providing for the removal of
residential garbage and refuse and the apportionment of the costs thereof.
Accordingly, the Village of Suffern herein establishes two districts so as to
classify together those units with similar garbage and refuse requirements.
In order to accomplish this purpose, it is the intention of this article to
establish a district for residential condominiums and cooperatives, which
generally utilize garbage containers or dumpsters for the removal of
garbage and refuse, and to establish a separate district for residential
dwellings not exceeding six on a lot which generally utilize standard-size
garbage cans for curbside pickup.
§ 150-11. Charging of removal costs.
In order to equitably apportion the cost of such garbage and refuse removal,
the Village of Suffern also intends to remove the expenses of such garbage
removal from the general Village budget and to charge the cost of garbage
and refuse removal to those units in such district receiving such service.
As a consequence, any property owner who does not receive garbage and
refuse removal service from or through the Village of Suffern will not be
charged for the same in either the general Village real property tax or the
district tax. Those units receiving such service will be charged on a unit
basis.
§ 150-12. Statutory authority.
In order to effectuate the formation of such districts, the Board of Trustees
herein exercises the authority delegated to it by the Statute of Local
Governments § 10, Subdivision 5, and Municipal Home Rule Law § 10,
Subdivision 1(ii)a(9-a) and e(3), so as to establish such districts and the
means to charge and collect the charges, rates and fees therefor from the
uses of such service and to amend and supplement the application of the
provisions of the Village Law sections.

community collection container or designated collection area at any
time. Authorized persons in curbside districts are the employees of the

of recyclables on behalf of the Village, or designees of the Village,
engaged for that purpose. Authorized persons in the container districts
shall be the employees of the Village, or Village designees, if collection

larceny. A charge under § 150-19C shall not preclude prosecution under
the larceny provisions of the Penal Law of the State of New York for the
same offense. A violation of § 150-19C of this article may also involve
the violation of § 168-3 of the Code of the Village of Suffern as a
separate offense if the facts so warrant.
C. Appearance tickets for violations of this article may be issued by any
police officer of the Village of Suffern or by the Code Enforcement

demonstrated, the Board may permit a variance from the
applicable section, provided that the dwelling will vary only a
reasonable minimum from the literal provision of this chapter and
will comply generally with the spirit and intent of the regulations as

on the premises on a permanent basis. This information shall be
conspicuously posted in the lobby or entrance area of each such
dwelling. In addition, the owner must furnish to the Village Clerk before
January 1 of each year a telephone number at which the owner or an
agent may be reached 24 hours per day.
B. Notification to owner. Whenever the Police Department, Fire
Department, ambulance service or other emergency service is required
to respond to property described in § 162-14A of this chapter, the Police
Department shall notify the owner by telephone of such incidents as
soon as is practicable, at the telephone number provided by the owner
pursuant to § 162-14A of this chapter. The Police Department shall
subsequently provide written notification to the owner of the incident at
the address specified pursuant to § 162-14A of this chapter. The
provisions of this subsection are not intended to create a duty on the
part of the Village to any property owner, tenant or resident.

§ 165-1. Legislative intent.
Numerous multifamily tax-exempt residential developments exist in the
Village of Suffern. Statistically these developments have produced an
extraordinary demand on the Village's emergency services. It is the intent of
the Board of Trustees in enacting this chapter that an annual life and safety
fee be established in order to permit the Village to continue to provide the
same excellent level of service to these developments. Recognizing that it
would be inequitable to impose such a fee on established developments,
the annual fee will be applicable only to new developments that have
not received a building permit as of the effective date of this chapter.
In adopting this chapter, the Board of Trustees utilizes the provisions of
§ 10(ii)(a)(9-a), 10(ii)(a)(12) and 10(ii)(e)(3) of the Municipal Home Rule
Law.
§ 165-2. Annual life and safety fee.
A. Any person failing to comply with a lawful order pursuant to this
chapter or committing an offense against any provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000,
or by community service in an amount deemed appropriate by the
court, or by imprisonment for a term not exceeding 15 days, or by any
combination of the same.
B. The continuation of an offense against the provisions of this chapter
shall constitute, for each week the offense is continued, a separate and
distinct offense hereunder.

The Rockland County Legislature has authorized the installation of an "E
911" system within the County, which is intended to reduce the response
time for emergency services in every Town and Village throughout the
County, thereby resulting in a benefit to the health, safety and welfare of
all residents. In order to accomplish this purpose, the Board of Trustees
of the Village of Suffern recognizes the need to require that all parcels of
real property within the Village be numbered and that the numbers must be
conspicuously placed on said parcels so as to be identifiable for response by
emergency services.

The Building Inspector of the Village of Suffern shall have authority to
assign numbers to every parcel of real property within the Village. Such
numbers shall be sequential, with odd numbers on one side of a street

property is legally able to be subdivided, such parcel shall be allocated as
many numbers as may be anticipated to be necessary to accomplish the
purpose of this chapter. All property owners assigned a new number shall
be notified in writing of the number assigned to the property owned.

Within 30 days after notification that a number has been assigned to a
parcel of real property, the owner of said real property or the agent of
such owner shall place or cause to be placed on such real property the
number or numbers assigned to such real property. Such owner or agent
shall be required to maintain the placement of such number or numbers in
accordance with such section.
A. The number or numbers assigned to a parcel of real property as set
forth in § 177-2 of this chapter shall be conspicuously shown by
placement on the principal building situated on the lot. Such numbers
shall be placed on the side of the building facing the street upon which
the property is situated. In the event the principal building on a lot is
set back more than 50 feet from the street line, the number or numbers
shall be placed upon a mailbox, gate post, fence or other appropriate
place so that it shall be visible from the street.
B. Numbers on residential buildings shall be not less than three inches in
height. Numbers on nonresidential buildings shall be not less than four
inches in height. All numbers shall be clearly visible and shall be in a
contrasting color to the building or place upon which it is affixed.

ARTICLE I
Infiltration Inflow Management Program
[Adopted 5-8-2006 by L.L. No. 3-200655]
§ 220-1. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this article is to reduce wet-weather peak inflow to the
sewage treatment plant to avoid violation of the Village's SPDES permit and
to reserve plant capacity for Village development requirements. In order to
avoid a moratorium or delay construction until the Village's sanitary sewer
infiltration and inflow work is complete, developers may contribute to offset
their new flow contribution and thereby accelerate the Village's ability to
make the required infiltration and inflow improvements.
§ 220-2. I/I contribution.
In order to create a fund sufficient to fund the required infiltration and
inflow work and improvements, an "I/I fee" in an amount set forth in the
Village of Suffern Standard Schedule of Fees shall be paid as a condition of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy or issuance of a wastewater discharge
permit or amendment thereto, except for one- and two-family homes, by any
person, corporation, or entity who:
§ 220-3. Application form; computation of fee; disposition of fees.
An applicant for site plan approval or subdivision approval and any
significant industrial user who proposes to increase wastewater flow above
existing permit limits shall complete an application regarding sewage
system flow on a form provided by the Village. Based on the fee set forth
in the Standard Schedule of Fees, the Superintendent of the Department
of Public Works shall compute the I/I fee, which shall be paid prior to
the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. The fees so received shall be
maintained in a dedicated trust account to be used only for the purposes set
forth herein, including studies, engineering and construction to eliminate or
minimize infiltration and inflow.
A. Increases wastewater flow above the permit limits established for
significant industrial users; or
B. Is required to obtain site plan approval and is determined during the
review to have a substantial increase in wastewater flow as compared
to the existing use; that is, an increase of more than 2,000 gallons per
day.

ARTICLE III
Sewer Rents
[Adopted 4-12-1982 by L.L. No. 4-1982]
§ 220-38. Legislative intent.
It is the intention of the Village of Suffern to provide, by the adoption of this
article, for the establishment and imposition of sewer rents for the Village
of Suffern as authorized by Article 14-F of the General Municipal Law, to
ensure a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance costs to
each user and to utilize the sewer rents as the principal source of revenue
for the operation and maintenance of the sewer system and treatment plant
and for payment of principal and interest for all obligations in connection
with capital expenditures for the sewer system and treatment plant.
§ 220-39. Sewer Rent Fund.
Revenues derived from collection of sewer rents, including penalties and
interest shall be credited to a separate fund to be denominated as the
"Sewer Rent Fund," and moneys contained in such fund shall be used
and expended in accordance with the provisions of § 453 of the General
Municipal Law of the State of New York and in accordance with the
following priorities set forth in § 453 of the General Municipal Law:
§ 220-40. Sewer rent based on water usage.
A. For the payment of the costs of operation, maintenance and repairs of
the sewer system and treatment plant.
B. For the payment of the interest on and amortization of or payment of
indebtedness which has been or shall be incurred for the construction
of the sewer system and treatment plant.
C. For the construction of sewage treatment and disposal works with
necessary appurtenances, including pumping stations, or for the
extension, enlargement or replacement of or additions to such sewer
systems or part or parts thereof.
A. The Board of Trustees shall impose a scale of charges for the use of the
sewer system and treatment plant on or prior to May 1 and November 1
of each year. The amount of the sewer rents shall be based on the
consumption of water and shall apply to all users of the Village of
Suffern sewer system and treatment plant. [Amended 10-28-1997 by
L.L. No. 8-1997]
B. The Board of Trustees may semiannually determine by amendment to
this article to change the amount of the sewer rent applicable to the
Village of Suffern. Said change, if any, shall be determined prior to May
1 and November 1 and shall be billed to users of the sewer system and
treatment plant at the same time, or as close to the same time as is
practical, as the Village water bills are rendered. [Amended
§ 220-38 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 220-40
1:249
§ 220-41. Surcharges.
6-13-1983 by L.L. No. 4-1983; 7-18-1994 by L.L. No. 8-1994;
12-20-1995 by L.L. No. 8-1995; 10-28-1997 by L.L. No. 8-1997]
C. The sewer rent shall be based upon the amount of water consumed by a
user, as determined in the last water consumption meter reading made
in or about April of each year. [Amended 4-9-1984 by L.L. No.
3-1984; 7-18-1994 by L.L. No. 8-1994; 12-20-1995 by L.L. No.
8-1995; 10-28-1997 by L.L. No. 8-1997]
D. The Board of Trustees shall determine the annual sewer rent by
application of the following formula: the total anticipated cost for
operation and maintenance of the sewer system and treatment plant
and the payment for principal and interest for payment of indebtedness
incurred for the construction of the sewer system and treatment plant
less miscellaneous revenues divided by the total water consumed in the
Village as shown by the water consumption readings which form the
basis of the previous May water bills. The quotient so determined shall
be the annual sewer rent rate for the year, and the annual sewer rent
due from each user shall be determined by multiplying the quotient by
the water consumed by each user during the six-month period, as
shown on the previous May water bills. The semiannual sewer rent due
from each user shall be determined by dividing the annual sewer rent
due from each user by two. [Amended 7-18-1994 by L.L. No.
8-1994; 12-20-1995 by L.L. No. 8-1995]
E. A minimum yearly sewer rent shall be established by the Board of
Trustees and may be revised, from time to time, by amendment of this
article. Said minimum rate shall be utilized only in cases of new
construction for which a full six-month history of water consumption as
shown on an August water bill is not available.
F. Whenever a user conveys property which is subject to a sewer use
charge and the vendor so notifies the Village, the Village shall prorate
the charge to the owner of the premises based upon the previous
August water reading and the portion of the billing period for which the
user owned the premises.
G. If no water reading can be made because the user or owner refuses to
admit representatives of the Village to read the water meter, or if no
reading can be made or if the reading is erroneous because the water
meter was broken or malfunctioned, the bill of the uses shall be
estimated, such estimate being based upon the history of usage at said
premises.
A. In order to ensure a proportional distribution of the operation and
maintenance cost to each user, any user who shall discharge or cause to
be discharged any wastewater which contains a five-day biochemical
oxygen demand, as defined in § 220-4 of the Code of the Village of
§ 220-40 SUFFERN CODE § 220-41
1:250
§ 220-42. Sewer Rent Appeal Board.
§ 220-43. Collection.
Suffern, greater than 400 parts per million by weight shall be
surcharged in accordance with Subsection B herein.
B. Any user who violates the standard set forth in Subsection A herein
shall, in addition to its sewer rent, pay a surcharge computed as
follows:
surcharge = sewer rent x (average daily BOD - 400)/400 x 0.20
C. The surcharge shall be collected and enforced in the same manner as
the sewer rent. The methodology for establishment of the surcharge is
shown in Appendix A (§ 220-48).
A. An appeal board to be known as the "Sewer Rent Appeal Board" and to
be composed of three members, to be appointed by the Mayor and
confirmed by the Board of Trustees, is hereby created. The terms of the
first three members shall be staggered such that the term of a member
will expire at the end of each official year for three years, the first such
term expiring on April 4, 1983. Upon the expiration of the term of each
of the three persons first appointed, the term of appointment shall be
for three years.
B. Any individual or legal entity may appeal to the Sewer Rent Appeal
Board if he or it believes that a substantial portion of the water
delivered to its premises, upon which the current bill has been
rendered, has been utilized or diverted on a regular or continuing basis
such that it has not flowed into the sewer system or if he or it can
demonstrate a significant change in water usage since the water meter
reading upon which the sewer rent is based. The burden of proof shall
be upon the appellant to demonstrate that a substantial portion of the
water delivered was utilized or diverted on a regular or continuing
basis such that it has not flowed into the sewer system or that there has
been a significant change in water usage since the water meter reading
upon which the sewer rent is based. Based upon the evidence presented
to the Sewer Rent Appeal Board, it may determine that only a
percentage of the volume of water delivered shall be used in
determining the user's sewer rent. All such appeals must be filed in the
office of the Village Clerk by August 15. A decision of the Sewer Rent
Appeal Board becomes final when filed in the office of the Village Clerk.
The decision of the Appeal Board shall be sent to the appellant.
A. Bills shall be rendered semiannually on or about May 15 and November
15 of each year and are due and payable within 30 days from such
billing date. [Amended 7-18-1994 by L.L. No. 8-1994; 12-20-1995

§ 220-45. Toxic pollutants.
Any user who discharges a toxic pollutant which causes an increase in the
cost of managing the effluent or the sludge at the wastewater treatment
plant shall pay for such increased costs.
§ 220-46. Inconsistent agreements.
The sewer rental charge established herein shall take precedence over any
terms or conditions between the Village and users which are inconsistent
with the requirements of the article.
B. All sewer rent bills not paid within 30 days from the billing date shall be
assessed a late charge of 10% of the gross amount of the bill and an
additional penalty of 2% of the sewer rent due and late charges if not
paid within 90 days of the date due. [Amended 4-11-2005 by L.L. No.

C. The sewer rents shall constitute a lien upon the real property served,
and the lien shall be prior and superior to every other lien or claim,
except the lien of an existing tax, assessment or other lawful charge
imposed by or for the State of New York or a political subdivision
thereof, and may be enforced as provided in § 452, Subdivision 4, of the
General Municipal Law.
A. The sewer rent shall be established and may be changed by local law
following a public hearing thereon. The sewer rate shall be $7.93 per
100 cubic feet of water consumed for properties located in the Village
of Suffern.
B. The minimum sewer rent shall be $25 per billing period.
C. The Board of Trustees may allow properties located outside the
corporate limits of the Village of Suffern to access and utilize the Village
sewage system if it is determined that all aspects of the system possess
sufficient excess capacity. If it is subsequently determined that any
aspect of the system is insufficient, the Village may terminate such
outside the Village access upon such notice as the Board of Trustees
deems to be reasonable. Such outside users shall be charged at the rate
of $8.61 per 100 cubic feet of water used as reflected on the bill
provided by their water supplier. Such user shall provide copies of such
water bills to the Village Clerk within five days of receipt of the same in
order for the Village to calculate the applicable sewer rent. If the
outside user fails to do so, the Village will render an estimated sewer
rent. If such outside user fails to provide such water bill upon demand,
the Village may terminate service upon 30 days' written notice. In any
event, the minimum bill chargeable to an outside user shall be $25 per
billing period.

special permit uses shall be determined as follows:
(a) Except for window signs, the total area of all signs shall not
exceed 1 1/2 square feet for each horizontal linear foot of the
front facade of the establishment. The area of each sign shall
be computed as follows:
[1] For individual signs, the area of a sign shall be computed
by delineating the smallest square, circle, rectangle,
triangle or combination thereof that will encompass the
extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem or
other display, together with any material or color forming
§ 228-26 SUFFERN CODE § 228-26
1:296
an integral part of the background of the display or used
to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed, but not including any
supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall
when such fence or wall otherwise meets the Zoning
Law102 and is clearly incidental to the display itself. In the
case of a facade or freestanding sign, the entire face shall
be measured in computing the sign area.
[2] For multifaced signs, the sign area shall be computed by
adding together the area of all sign faces visible from any
one point. When two identical sign faces are placed back
to back, so that both faces cannot be viewed from any one
point at the same time, and when such sign faces are part
of the same sign structure, the sign area shall be computed
by the measurement of one of the faces.
(b) If an establishment fronts on a public parking lot, an additional
sign area equal to 50% of the sign area that would be
permitted for a facade sign shall be allowed, provided that the
additional sign area appears on that side of the building visible
from the parking lot. The sign shall be a facade sign meeting all
other dimensional requirements for said type of sign; provided,
however, that no sign shall exceed a maximum dimension of 10
feet in length and two feet in height.
(c) All signs shall comply with the accompanying Schedule of Sign
Requirements.103
(2) Except as may be specifically referred to herein, "establishment"
may refer to a tenant in a multitenant building or to an entire
building if it is owned by or leasable to one tenant.
E. Prohibited sign types. The use, erection or installation of the following
sign types is prohibited:
(1) Billboards.
(2) Roof signs.
(3) Signs attached to buildings that extend above the roofline.
(4) Flashing or intermittently illuminated signs. A sign which exhibits
changing light or color effects, even though the intensity of light
may be relatively constant, shall be deemed a flashing sign.
(5) Signs where the source of illumination is visible, including neontype
electric signs, except as may be permitted for window signs as
outlined in the Schedule of Sign Requirements.104
102. Editor's Note: See Ch. 266, Zoning.

(11) Portable signs, with or without wheels, easel type, A-frame or other
or any sign not permanently affixed to a building or the ground.
(12) Inflatable signs and tethered balloons.
F. General regulations. The following regulations apply to all types of
signs in all districts:
(1) Illumination. Signs in nonresidential districts may be illuminated,
provided that the source of illumination shall be shielded so that it
is not visible beyond the boundaries of the lot on which it is located.
(2) Relationship to a permitted use. All signs must pertain to a use
conducted on the same property on which they are located, except
signs of service groups and religious institutions.
G. Design standards. The Planning Board, in promulgating site plan
regulations, shall provide for a limitation on the size of the signs, type
and characteristics of illumination, number and location, taking into
consideration the uses on the site and the reasonable requirement for
communicating information to the vehicular or pedestrian traffic. The
Planning Board shall consider the following in granting sign approval:
(1) Signs must be clearly accessory to the use or uses on the lot on
which they are located, and such signs and lighting must be shown
to be essential to the principal use upon the lot.
(2) Signs should be a subordinate part of the streetscape.
(3) The size and content of the sign shall be the minimum essential for
legibility and for the provision of information to patrons or invitees
seeking the particular use described on such sign.
(4) The sign content shall not hawk or peddle and must clearly provide
only information necessary to identify the use upon the lot.
(5) Garish colors and materials should be avoided. Signs which have
dark background colors and light letters are preferred in order to
minimize the apparent size of letters within the streetscape.
104. Editor's Note: The Schedule of Sign Requirements is located at the end of this chapter.
§ 228-26 SUFFERN CODE § 228-26

(6) The sign shall not be such as to be confused with any traffic signal
or other safety device nor be composed of elements depicting in
exaggerated size or grotesque style the use upon the lot.
(7) All signs, together with their supporting braces, guys, anchors,
etc., shall be kept in repair and in proper state of preservation. The
display surfaces of all signs shall be kept neatly painted or
maintained at all times.
(8) Awnings and canopies existing prior to the adoption of this chapter

I. Enforcement. The erection of a sign not conforming to an approved sign
plan shall be deemed a violation of these regulations. No sign plan shall
hereafter be approved or sign permit issued, except pursuant to the
requirements of this chapter and the Zoning Law.105 No permit shall be
§ 228-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-26
1:299
issued for any sign which does not conform to an approved sign plan or
site development plan.
(1) The Building Inspector or the Code Enforcement Officer shall notify
a property owner by written notice of a sign which has been
erected in contravention of an approved sign plan and any
conditions which have been attached thereto. Said notice shall be
sent by certified mail to the owner of the sign.
(2) The sign owner shall take down or obtain sign plan approval
immediately in accordance with the procedures contained in these
regulations. If the owner of the nonconforming sign has not met the
requirements of the notice, the Building Inspector, the Code
Enforcement Officer or any authorized agent of the Village shall be
authorized to issue a violation against said owner.
J. Removal of certain signs. Any sign, including structural supports or
frame, now or hereafter existing, which no longer identifies a use on the
subject premises or which is not being maintained shall be taken down
and removed by the owner, agent or person having the beneficial use of
the building or structure upon which such sign is found within 10 days
after written notification from the Building Inspector. Upon failure to
comply with such notice within the time specified in such order, the
Building Inspector shall issue a violation to said owner.
K. Unsafe signs. Should a sign be or become insecure or in danger of
falling or otherwise unsafe in the opinion of the Building Inspector, the
owner thereof or person maintaining the same shall, upon receipt of
written notice from the Building Inspector and, in any case, within five
days thereafter, secure the same in a manner to be approved by the
Building Inspector. If such order is not complied with, the Building
Inspector is hereby authorized to cause removal of the unsafe sign, and
any expense incident thereto shall be paid by the owner of the building,
structure or premises on which such sign is located. When any sign is in
such dangerous condition as to be immediately dangerous to the safety
of the public, the Building Inspector is hereby authorized to take such
action as in his opinion shall be necessary to protect the public or
property. The cost of the removal shall be borne by the owner of the
property on which such sign was erected and shall become a lien upon
such property until paid.
L. Conformance to Village plan. Signs shall conform to any Village Design
Plan for signs, which plan may be adopted by the Planning Board as an
overall guide to signs in a specific area or district, including a facade
design study.
M. Adjustment of sign regulation. The Planning Board may adjust the
requirements for a particular sign, including prohibited signs, where it
finds that they may be impractical due to existing conditions, such as

ARTICLE VI
Site Planning Design Criteria
§ 228-27. Purpose; findings.
§ 228-28. Applicability.
A. It is the purpose of this Article to promote the health, safety, comfort
and general welfare of the community and to eliminate blight and
promote the character and appearances and to conserve and improve
the property values of the Village, the attractiveness of whose
residential and business areas is the mainstay of the community, by
providing procedures for an architectural review of those business,
commercial, industrial and residential structures henceforth erected,
reconstructed, altered or remodeled in the Village of Suffern, and
thereby:
(1) To encourage good qualities of exterior building design and good
appearances to the sites and surroundings.
(2) To permit originality and resourcefulness in building design and
good appearances which are appropriate to the sites and
surroundings.
(3) To prevent such design and appearances as are offensive to the
visual sensibilities even when the design conforms to existing
design of surrounding structures.
B. The Village Board hereby finds that structures which are visually
offensive or inappropriate by reason of poor qualities or exterior design,
monotonous similarity or striking visual discord in relation to their sites
and surroundings mar the appearances of their areas, impair their use,
enjoyment and desirability and reduce the values of properties, are
detrimental to the characters of neighborhoods, prevent the most
appropriate development and utilization of land and therefore
adversely affect the functioning, economic stability, prosperity, health,
safety and general welfare of the entire community.
A. This article shall not apply to single-family or two-family detached
residential structures or additions or alterations thereto.
B. The requirements of this article shall apply to a building permit for the
construction of a new building or other structure or an alteration or
addition to any building or other structure affecting the exterior of said
building or structure where the cost of such a new building or structure
or alteration or addition to a building or structure is estimated to be
$5,000 or more by the Building Inspector. The requirements shall also
apply to solar energy collectors and microwave dishes, regardless of
cost. The Building Inspector may, in his discretion, refer to the Planning
Board any other application for a building permit.
§ 228-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-29
1:303
§ 228-29. Standards.
A. Relationship of buildings to the site.
(1) The site shall be planned to accomplish a desirable transition with
the streetscape and to provide for adequate planting, safe
pedestrian movement and parking areas.
(2) Site planning in which setbacks and yards are in excess of zoning
restrictions is encouraged to provide an interesting relationship
between buildings.
(3) Parking areas shall be treated with decorative elements, building
wall extensions, plantings, berms or other innovative means so as
to screen parking areas from view of public ways.
(4) Without restricting the permissible limits of the applicable zoning
district, the height and scale of each building shall be compatible
with its site and existing or anticipated adjoining buildings.
(5) Newly installed utility services and service revisions necessitated
by exterior alterations shall be underground.
(6) All structures in the PO-15 and PO-40, MR-50 and PLI Zoning
Districts shall be oriented in a manner which minimizes visibility of
the structure from the street or highway in order to avoid long
continuous frontages visible from the street or highway. [Added
10-20-1997 by L.L. No. 7-1997]
B. Relationship of buildings and site to adjoining area.
(1) Adjacent buildings of different architectural styles shall be made
compatible by such means as screens, screen breaks and materials.
(2) Attractive landscape transition to adjoining properties shall be
provided.
(3) Harmony in texture, lines and masses is required. Monotony shall
be avoided.
C. Landscape and site treatment. Landscape elements included in these
criteria consist of all forms of plantings and vegetation, ground forms,
rock groupings, water patterns and all visible construction except
buildings and utilitarian structures.
(1) Where natural or existing topographic patterns contribute to the
beauty and utility of a development, they shall be preserved and
developed. Modifications to topography will be permitted where
they contribute to good appearance.
(2) Grades of walks, parking spaces, terraces and other paved areas
shall provide an inviting and stable appearance for walking and, if
seating is provided, for sitting.
§ 228-29 SUFFERN CODE § 228-29
1:304
(3) Landscape treatment shall be provided to enhance architectural
features, strengthen vistas and provide shade. Spectacular effects
shall be reserved for special locations only.
(4) Unity of design shall be achieved by repetition of certain plant
varieties and other materials and by correlation with adjacent
developments.
(5) Plant material shall be selected for interest in its structure, texture
and color and for its ultimate growth. Plants that are indigenous to
the area and others that will be hardy, harmonious to the design
and of good appearance shall be used.
(6) In locations where plants will be susceptible to injury by pedestrian
or motor traffic, they shall be protected by appropriate curbs, tree
guards or other devices.
(7) Parking areas and traffic ways shall be enhanced with landscaped
spaces containing trees or tree groupings.
(8) Where building sites limit planting, the placement of trees in
parkways or paved areas is encouraged.
(9) Screening of service yards, dumpster locations and other places
that tend to be unsightly shall be accomplished by use of walls,
fencing, planting or combinations of these. Screening shall be
equally effective in winter and summer.
(10) In areas where general planting will not prosper, other materials,
such as fences, walls and pavings of wood, brick, stone, gravel and
cobbles, shall be used. Carefully selected plants shall be combined
with such materials where possible.
(11) Exterior lighting, when used, shall enhance the building design and
the adjoining landscape. Lighting standards and building fixtures
shall be of a design and size compatible with the building and
adjacent areas. Lighting shall be restrained in design and excessive
brightness avoided.

with permanent neighboring development.
(a) Materials shall have a good architectural character and shall
be selected for harmony of the building with its components
and with adjoining buildings.
§ 228-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 228-29
1:305
(b) Materials shall be selected for suitability to the type of
buildings and the design in which they are used. Buildings
shall have the same materials, or those that are architecturally
harmonious, used for all building walls and other exterior
building components wholly or partly visible from public
facilities and ways.
(c) Materials shall be of durable quality.
(d) In any design in which the structural frame is exposed to view,
the structural materials shall be compatible with themselves
and harmonious with their surroundings.
(3) Building components, such as windows, doors, eaves and parapets,
shall have good proportions and relationships to one another.
(4) Colors shall be harmonious and shall use only compatible accents.

buildings shall be screened from public view with materials
harmonious to the building or they shall be located as not to be
visible from any public ways.
(6) Exterior lighting shall be part of the architectural concept.
Fixtures, standards and all exposed accessories shall be
harmonious with building design.
(7) Refuse and waste removal areas, service yards, storage yards and
exterior work areas shall be screened from view of public ways,
using materials harmonious to the building.
(8) Monotony of design in single or multiple building projects shall be
avoided. Variation of detail, form and siting shall be used to provide
visual interest. In multiple building projects, variable siting or
individual buildings may be used to prevent a monotonous
appearance.
E. Miscellaneous structures and street hardware.
(1) Miscellaneous structures and street hardware shall be designed to
be part of the architectural concept of design and landscape.
Materials shall be compatible with buildings, scale shall be in
harmony with buildings and surroundings and proportions shall be
attractive.
(2) Lighting in connection with miscellaneous structures and street
hardware shall meet the criteria applicable to site, landscape and
buildings.

maintenance. The choice of materials and their use, together with
§ 228-29 SUFFERN CODE § 228-29
1:306
§ 228-30. Planning Board limitations.
the types of finishes and other protective measures, must be
conducive to easy maintenance and upkeep.
(2) Materials and finishes shall be selected for their durability and
wear as well as for their beauty. Proper measures and devices shall
be incorporated for protection against the elements, neglect,
damage and abuse.
(3) Provision for washing and cleaning of buildings and structures and
control of dirt and refuse shall be included in the design.
Configurations that tend to catch and accumulate debris, leaves,
trash, dirt and rubbish shall be avoided.
A. The Planning Board shall restrict its considerations to a reasonable and
professional review of the proposal and plans, leaving full responsibility
for the design and development to the applicant. Such Board shall not
design or assist in the design of any buildings or structures submitted
for approval.
B. The Planning Board shall not unduly restrict new or innovative building

ARTICLE I
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
[Adopted 6-6-2005 by L.L. No. 4-2005112]
§ 233-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition.
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species.
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat.
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation.
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow.
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality.
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities.
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and

§ 233-22. Discharge prohibitions; connection prohibitions.
A. Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to
be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters
containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of
applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. The
commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the
storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:
(1) The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this article: water line flushing or other potable
water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted
stream flows, rising groundwater, groundwater infiltration to storm
drains, uncontaminated pumped groundwater, foundation or
footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering
systems), crawl space pumps, air-conditioning condensation,
springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian
habitat of wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated,
typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire-fighting activities, and
any other water source not containing pollutants.
(2) Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
(3) Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time
of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any nonstormwater discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge
order issued to the discharger and administered under the
authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency,
provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable
laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been
grantee for any discharge to the storm drain system.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection

§ 233-23. Suspension of MS4 access.
§ 233-24. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Stormwater Control Officer prior to the allowing of
discharges to the MS4.
§ 233-25. Monitoring of discharges.
was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at
the time of connection.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a
connection to continue.
A. Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The
Stormwater Control Officer may, without prior notice, suspend MS4
discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop
an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present
imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps as deemed
necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this article may have his or her
MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an
illicit discharge. The authorized enforcement agency will notify a
violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may
petition the authorized enforcement agency for a reconsideration and
hearing.
C. A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior
approval of the authorized enforcement agency.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater
discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction
activity.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The Stormwater Control Officer shall be permitted to enter and
inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as
may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a
discharger has security measures in force which require proper
§ 233-22 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 233-25
1:337
identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the
discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access
to representatives of the authorized enforcement agency.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the Stormwater Control Officer ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept
under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater,
and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state
and federal law.
(3) The Stormwater Control Officer shall have the right to set up on
any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/
or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.
(4) The Stormwater Control Officer has the right to require the
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained
at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the
discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure
stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
(5) Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the
Stormwater Control Officer and shall not be replaced. The costs of
clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
(6) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Stormwater Control Officer
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater
discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of
a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated
with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the
authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted
facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(7) If the Stormwater Control Officer has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/
she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may
be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and
welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
§ 233-25 SUFFERN CODE § 233-26
1:338
§ 233-26. Requirement to use of best management practices.
The Stormwater Control Officer will adopt requirements identifying best
management practices for any activity, operation, or facility which may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm
drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial
or industrial establishment shall provide, at his or her own expense,
reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials
or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any
person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the
source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's
expense, additional structural and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the
further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer
system, Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity,
to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of
this section. These BMPs shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention
plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES
permit.
§ 233-27. Watercourse protection.
Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such
person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within
the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse,
so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.
§ 233-28. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain
system, or water of the U.S., said person shall take all necessary steps to
ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event
of such a release of hazardous materials, said person shall immediately
notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency
dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous materials,
said person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or
by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in
person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and
mailed to the Stormwater Control Officer within three business days of
the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from
a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such
§ 233-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 233-28
1:339
establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge
and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be
retained for at least three years.
§ 233-29. Notice of violation.
§ 233-30. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the Stormwater Control Officer. The notice of appeal must be personally
served on the Village Clerk within 14 days from the date of the notice
of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the Board of Trustees or its
designee shall take place within 15 days from the date of receipt of the
notice of appeal.
§ 233-31. Enforcement measures after appeal.
If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within 14
days of the decision of the Board of Trustees upholding the decision of
the Stormwater Control Officer, then representatives of the authorized
enforcement agency shall enter upon the subject private property and are
A. Whenever the Stormwater Control Officer finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the
Stormwater Control Officer may order compliance by written notice of
violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without
limitation:
(1) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(2) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(3) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(4) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property; and
(5) Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
B. If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further
advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore within the
established deadline, the work will be done by a designated
governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be
charged to the violator.
§ 233-28 SUFFERN CODE § 233-31
1:340
authorized to take any and all measures necessary to abate the violation
and/or restore the property. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner,
agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to allow the
government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the premises for
the purposes set forth above.
§ 233-32. Cost of abatement.
Within 30 days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property
will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The
property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the
assessment by filing a detailed protest with the Village Clerk within 14 days.
If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the
decision or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the
charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall
constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment and shall
be levied on the next Village real property tax bill. Any person violating any
of the provisions of this article shall become liable to the Village by reason
of such violation. Interest at the rate of 18% per annum shall be assessed on
the balance beginning on the 31st day following discovery of the violation.
§ 233-33. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the Board of Trustees may
institute an action for a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the
person from activities which would create further violations or compelling
the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 233-34. Alternative compensatory action.
In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties, and remedies authorized
by this article, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a
violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling,
attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
§ 233-35. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions of

reconstruction of curbs or sidewalks located in the right-of-way, the
Board of Trustees may, in its discretion, determine that the owners of
real property adjoining such sidewalks and/or curbs shall be
responsible for all or a proportion of the cost for such construction or
reconstruction and shall determine the percent or proportion for which
each property owner shall be responsible. In determining whether the
Village will assume all or any portion of the cost of the same, the Village
may consider: whether the sidewalks or curbing to be constructed or
reconstructed are standard materials for construction or are an
§ 235-7 SUFFERN CODE § 235-10.1
1:352
upgrade as compared to the Village standard; the entity that originally

reconstruction; the frontage and physical relationship of each affected
property; and any other relevant factor.
B. The Board of Trustees may pass a resolution allocating the cost of any
such construction or reconstruction between the Village and adjoining
property owners and the percentage responsibility of each prior to the
commencement of any such construction and setting forth the
approximate anticipated charge to each property owner. The resolution
shall also determine whether the sun due by each property owner shall
be paid in one or more installments and the frequency of periodic
payments if any. A copy of a notice summarizing the same shall be
mailed to each record property owner prior to the commencement of
construction at the address indicated on the tax roll.
C. Within 30 days after completion of construction, the Village Clerk shall
send a statement to each adjoining property owner of the amount due,
and a calculation showing the method of computation and a statement
that the amount is due within 30 days thereafter. Said statement shall
also provide that amounts remaining unpaid after such date shall incur
interest calculated monthly at 9% per annum. If said sum remains
unpaid at the time the next succeeding Village real property tax bill is
rendered, such amount shall be relevied on said tax bill and shall be
collected in the same manner as real property taxes.
D. The provisions of this section shall not change, alter, or modify the
obligations and liability of adjoining property owners set forth in
§ 235-7 of the Village Code.

openings or any work related thereto and to also defend on behalf of the
Village any such suits, actions or proceedings which may be instituted

good condition until the permanent surfacing is placed.

any excavation work shall not relieve the permittee of its

said applicant, his agents, servants or employees in connection with said
A. If the permittee shall have failed to restore the surface of the street to
its original and proper condition upon the expiration of the time fixed by
such permit or shall otherwise have failed to complete the excavation
work covered by such permit, the Superintendent of Public Works, if he
deems it advisable, shall have the right to do all work and things
necessary to restore the street and to complete the excavation work.
The permittee shall be liable for the actual cost thereof and 25% of such
cost in addition for general overhead and administrative expenses. The

paid out and due it for such work and shall apply, in payment of the
amount due it, any funds of the permittee deposited as herein provided.
The Village shall also enforce its rights under the permittee's bond
provided pursuant to this article.

Superintendent of Public Works is authorized to require security, in the
form of a bond, letter of credit or cash deposit, in an amount and form

§ 235-29. Exemptions. [Added 5-27-1975 by L.L. No. 8-1975]
This article shall not be construed to apply to the installation or
replacement of utility service over, under or through public areas by the
adjoining property owner or to the construction and repair of sidewalks,
whether done voluntarily or by direction of the Village, provided that the
limit of the work area does not encroach upon or disturb paved, surfaced
or traveled rights-of-way. This exemption shall apply solely to the adjoining
property owner, and in the event that the work to be performed shall be
performed in whole or in part by a contractor or subcontractor for the
benefit of the adjoining property owner, that contractor shall be required
to post insurances in accordance with the provisions of § 235-26 of this
article to cover the period of time during which service is to be performed.
If the work is performed by the adjoining property owner, said property
owner shall execute a letter of indemnification holding the Village free and
harmless from any and all liabilities. It is the intention of this exemption to
permit the adjoining property owner to install or replace utility service in
the areas set forth without the requirements of fees and deposits. However,
if, in the discretion of the Superintendent of Public Works, the homeowner
makes application for the purpose of assisting a contractor in avoiding the
provisions of this article, said Superintendent of Public Works shall have the
A. This article shall not be construed as imposing upon the Village or any
official or employee any liability or responsibility for damages to any
person injured by the performance of any excavation work for which an
excavation permit is issued hereunder, nor shall the Village or any
official or employee thereof be deemed to have assumed any such
liability or responsibility by reason of inspections authorized hereunder,
the issuance of any permit or the approval of any excavation work.
B. The permittee agrees in accepting a permit to save harmless the Village
of Suffern, its officers and servants from and against any injury, loss,
damage or legal action resulting from any negligence or fault of the

Every return shall have annexed thereto an affidavit of the head of the utility
making the same or of the owner or of a copartner thereof or of a principal
officer of the corporation, if such business is conducted by a corporation, to
the effect that the statements contained therein are true.
§ 244-5. Payment of tax.
At the time of filing a return as required by this Article, each utility shall
pay to the Village Treasurer the tax imposed by this Article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 244-6. Failure to submit acceptable return.
A. In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from him or if no return is made for any period, the Village Treasurer
shall determine the amount of tax due from such information as he is
able to obtain and, if necessary, may estimate the tax on the basis of
external indices or otherwise. He shall give notice of such
determination to the person liable for such tax. Such determination
shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax, unless the persons against
whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving of notice of
such determination, apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing or
unless the Village Treasurer, of his own motion, shall reduce the same.
After such hearing, the Village Treasurer shall give notice of his
decision to the person liable for the tax. Such decision may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York if application therefor is made within 90 days
after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such
decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be
reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first
deposited with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him,
in such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme
Court shall approve, to the effect that, if such proceeding is dismissed
or the tax confirmed, the applicant will pay all costs and charges which
may accrue in the prosecution of such proceeding; or, at the option of
the applicant, such undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the
tax, interest, penalties, costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the
applicant shall not be required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as
a condition precedent to the granting of such order.
B. Except in the case of a willfully false or fraudulent return with intent to
evade the tax, no assessment of additional tax shall be made after the
expiration of more than three years from the date of the filing of a

§ 244-7. Manner of giving notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this Article or, if no return has been
filed, to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this Article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 244-8. Penalties for failure to file or pay tax.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this Article shall be subject
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, except the first month, after such return
was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Village Treasurer,
for cause shown, may extend the time for filing any return and, if satisfied
that the delay was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty
fixed by the foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 244-9. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village Treasurer or
the; court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof
was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer shall refund
the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a
refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer. However,
no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Village Treasurer, as hereinbefore provided, unless the Village
Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established
in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal.
All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this Article. An
application for a refund made as hereinbefore provided shall be deemed
an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of, and
the Village Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect thereto.
After making his determination, the Village Treasurer shall give notice
thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to any order to
review such determination under said Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules, subject to the provisions hereinbefore contained relative to the
granting of such order.

utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
cost of such utility.
§ 244-11. Action to enforce payment.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
Article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.
§ 244-12. Powers of Village Treasurer.
In the administration of this Article, the Village Treasurer shall have power
to make such reasonable rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law,
as may be necessary for the exercise of his powers and the performance of

Suffern in an action or proceeding under the provisions of this Article or
on behalf of the State Tax Commission in an action or proceeding under
the provisions of the Tax Law of the State of New York or on behalf of
any party to any action or proceeding under the provisions of this
Article when the returns or facts shown thereby are directly involved in
such action or proceeding, in either of which events the court may
require the production of and may admit in evidence so much of said
returns or of the facts shown thereby as are pertinent to the action or
proceeding and no more. Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit

B. Notwithstanding any provisions of this Article, the Village Treasurer
may exchange with the chief fiscal officer of any City or any other
Village in the State of New York information contained in returns filed
under this Article, provided that such City or other Village grants
similar privileges to the Village of Suffern, and provided that such

in the Village of Suffern, from real property taxes imposed by the Village of
Suffern.
§ 244-16. Amount of exemption; conditions.
An eligible business facility as defined by the New York State Job Incentive
Board, pursuant to §§ 115 and 120 of the Commerce Law of the State of
New York, shall be granted an eighty-five-percent exemption from taxes
imposed by the Village of Suffern for any increase in the value thereof which
is attributable to expenditures certified by the Job Incentive Board to have
been paid or incurred by the owner or operator for capital improvements
commenced on or after the effective date of this Article, consisting of the
construction, reconstruction, erection or improvement of depreciable real
property included in such facility, and such exemptions shall be continued
from year to year during the specified period if the certificate of eligibility
with respect to such business facility is not revoked or modified and is
renewed or extended as provided by § 120 of the Commerce Law.
§ 244-17. Application.
Such exemption shall be granted upon an application by the owner or
operator of such facility on a form prescribed by the New York State Job
Incentive Board, to which there shall be attached a copy of the certificate
of eligibility issued by the New York State Job Incentive Board. Such
application shall be filed with the Assessor on or before January 1 of each
year. Copies of such application shall be filed simultaneously with the New
York State Job Incentive Board and the State Board of Equalization and

If an exemption has once been granted for a business facility under this
Article and the Assessor receives notice that a certificate of eligibility
of such facility has been revoked or modified, he shall redetermine the
assessed value of any such exemption in accordance with such revocation
or modification. If, upon such redetermination, it appears for a year for
which an exemption has been granted that such facility has been ineligible
or that the assessed value of such exemption as redetermined is less than
the assessed value of such exemption as shown on the assessment rolls
for such year, then a tax shall be levied at the rate of tax for such year
upon so much of the assessed valuation of such exemption, as shown on
such assessment rolls, as may be ineligible or excessive. Such tax shall be
levied as an omitted assessment in the manner provided in § 550 of the
Real Property Tax Law for each such year. Any such redetermination shall
be made no later than three years after the applicant for exemption last
received benefit of any exemption under said § 485 of the Real Property Tax
Law.121

The real property tax exemption provided herein on real property owned by
husband and wife, one of whom is 65 years of age or over, once granted,
shall not be rescinded solely because of the death of the older spouse so
long as the surviving spouse is at least 62 years of age.

A. If the income of the owner or combined income of the owners of the
property for the income tax year immediately preceding the date of

the United States Code, provided that the governing board of such
municipality, after public hearing, adopts a local law, ordinance or
resolution providing therefor. In computing net rental income and net
income from self-employment, no depreciation deduction shall be
allowed for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal property
held for the production of income. [Amended 12-2-1991 by L.L. No.

B. Unless the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner or
one of the owners of the property for at least 24 consecutive months
prior to the date of making application for exemption; provided,
however, that in the event of the death of either a husband or wife in
whose name the title of the property shall have been vested at the time
of death which then becomes vested solely in the survivor by virtue of
devise by or descent from the deceased husband or wife, the time of
ownership of the property by the deceased husband or wife shall be
deemed also a time of ownership by the survivor, and such ownership
shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing such period
of 24 consecutive months. In the event of a transfer by either a husband
or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the property, the
time of ownership of the property by the transferor spouse shall be
deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee spouse, and such
ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of computing
such period of 24 consecutive months. Where property of the owner or
owners has been acquired to replace property formerly owned by such
owner or owners and taken by eminent domain or other involuntary
proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership of the former
property shall be combined with the period of ownership of the
property for which application is made for exemption, and such periods
of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for purposes of this
section. Where a residence is sold and replaced with another within one
year and is in the same assessing unit or municipality, the period of
ownership of the former property shall be combined with the period of
ownership of the replacement residence and deemed consecutive for
exemption from taxation by each such assessing unit or municipality.
Where a residence is sold and replaced with another within one year
and both residences are within the state, the period of ownership of
both properties shall be deemed consecutive for the purposes of the
exemption from taxation by a municipality within the state granting
such exemption.
C. Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes.
D. Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied in
whole or in part by the owner or by all of the owners of the property.

owners of the property on forms to be furnished by the Assessor's office
and shall furnish the information and be executed in the manner required
or prescribed in such forms and shall be filed in such Assessor's office on or
before January 1 of each year.

person who was granted exemption pursuant to this Article on the latest
completed assessment roll an application or a notice that such application
must be filed on or before the first day of January and be approved in order

days of the completion and filing of the tentative assessment roll, notify by
mail any applicant who has included with his application at least one selfaddressed,
prepaid envelope of the approval or denial of the application;
provided, however, that the assessing authority shall, upon the receipt and
filing of the application, send by mail notification of receipt to any applicant
who has included two of such envelopes with the application. Where a
applicant is entitled to a notice of denial pursuant to this section, such
notice shall be on a form prescribed by the State Board of Equalization and
Assessment and shall state the reason for such denial and shall further state
that the applicant may have such determination reviewed in the manner
provided by law. Failure to mail any such application form or notice or
failure of such person to receive any of the same shall not prevent the levy,
collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property owned
by such person.
§ 244-26. Penalties for offenses.
Any person convicted of having made a willful false statement in an
application for such exemption shall be subject to a fine of not more than
$100 and shall be disqualified from any farther exemption for a period of
five years.
§ 244-27. Collection of tax erroneously exempted.

QUALIFIED RESIDENTIAL REAL PROPERTY  Property owned by a
qualified owner which is used exclusively for residential purposes; provided,

of the assessed value of such property, multiplied by 50% of the Cold
War veteran disability rating; provided, however, that such exemption
shall not exceed $40,000 or the product of $40,000 multiplied by the
latest state equalization rate for the assessing unit.
C. If a Cold War veteran received the exemption under §§ 458 or 458-a of
the Real Property Tax Law, the Cold War veteran shall not be eligible to
receive the exemption under this section.
D. The exemption provided by Subsection A of this section shall be granted
for a period of 10 years. The commencement of such ten-year period
shall be governed pursuant to this subsection. Where a qualified owner
owns qualifying residential real property on the effective date of this
article, such ten-year period shall be measured from the assessment
roll prepared pursuant to the first taxable status date occurring on or
after the effective date of this article. Where a qualified owner does not
own qualifying residential real property on the effective date of this
article, such ten-year period shall be measured from the assessment

of residential real property, such ten-year period shall be measured
from the first assessment roll in which the exemption occurs. If, before

ten-year exemption period.

date a certificate of no probable cause, copies of which shall be given
to the possessor of the vehicle and the Police Department. Upon receipt

mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and
prudence to believe that there was violation of this article.
B. The hearing officer shall conduct a hearing in an informal manner and
shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person
demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such
person has the right to possession of the vehicle. The Police Department
shall carry the burden of establishing that there was probable cause to
impound the vehicle in question. At the conclusion of the hearing, the
hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. A copy of such a
decision shall be provided to the person demanding the hearing and the
registered owner of the vehicle (if not the person requesting the
hearing). The hearing officer's decision in no way affects any criminal
proceeding in connection with the impound in question and any
criminal charges involved in such proceeding may only be challenged in
the appropriate court. The decision of the hearing officer is final.
Failure of the registered or legal owner or his agent to request or attend
a scheduled post-seizure hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right
to such hearing.

Water Service
[Adopted 2-8-1971 as Ch. 52 of the 1971 Code]
§ 261-1. Application for introduction of water.
§ 261-2. Metering required; exception.
A. It shall be unlawful for any property owner to obtain water for any
purpose from any source other than water supplied by the Village of
Suffern Water Department, hereinafter called the "Water Department."
It is forbidden for any property owner to dig any wells within the Village
for any purpose except where written application is made to the Suffern
Board of Trustees and permission for such well is given by said Board of
Trustees.
B. All applications for the introduction of water into any premises or for
the extension of any pipes for the conveyance of such water must be
made by the owner or authorized agent of the owner of the premises in
writing upon forms furnished by the Water Department. Every applicant
must agree to abide by the rules and regulations covering water usage.
A. All water except such water as is used for municipal purposes must be
metered.
B. Meters shall be supplied by the Water Department and paid for by
property owners.
C. All meters on or before the first day of October 1992 must be equipped
with a meter interface unit to enable the meter to be read by automatic
(remote) meter reading equipment. Such equipment will be installed at
Village Water Department expense if access is provided for such
installations on or before the 30th day of September 1992. [Added
7-20-1992 by L.L. No. 4-1992]
D. A surcharge of $25 per dwelling unit will be charged for each meter
reading if the owner or person in charge of property has failed,
neglected or refused to allow the installation of approved automatic
(remote) meter reading equipment and the existing meter must be
manually read by Village personnel. In the event that a scheduled
reading is canceled or Village personnel cannot obtain access to read a
meter, an additional surcharge of $25 will be charged for each such
subsequent reading. [Added 2-8-1993 by L.L. No. 1-1993]
E. Notification of telephone number changes; manual reading service
charge. [Added 6-21-1999 by L.L. No. 5-1999]

the current telephone number for that circuit on file with the Water
Department. When a telephone number used for accessing a water
§ 261-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 261-2
1:473
§ 261-3. Service lines.
meter is changed, the Water Department must be notified of the
new phone number within 10 days.
(2) If a telephone number for a circuit accessing a water meter is
changed and the Water Department is not notified of the new
number within 10 days, a manual reading service charge of $25 will
be levied against the owner of the building for each living unit
served by that water meter on the occasion of each manual
reading, not to exceed $100 per occurrence.
A. Ground clamps may not be attached to the service pipe closer than two
feet to the house and on the street side of the meter.
B. All service lines from the main line to the curbline shall be installed by
the Water Department up to a maximum of one inch, which installation
shall be paid in advance by the property owner at the rate as set by
resolution of the Board of Trustees in the Standard Schedule of Fees of
the Village of Suffern, for each line, in addition to the price of any
meter.135 [Amended 3-12-1990 by L.L. No. 3-1990]
C. All service lines from the main line to the curb in excess of one inch
shall be installed and paid for by the property owner after application to
the Water Department and the acquisition of a street opening permit
from the Village. All work for the installation of such service lines shall
be performed by a contractor possessing a current plumbing license
issued by the County of Rockland. [Amended 7-11-2011 by L.L. No.
11-2011; 6-10-2013 by L.L. No. 6-2013]
D. All service lines from the curb to the building shall be installed and paid
for by the property owner.
E. All service lines on state roads and federal roads shall be installed and
paid for by the property owner after application to the Water
Department and the acquisition of a road-opening permit from the
appropriate state or federal agency. Installation from the main to the
meter and proper tests before filling in the ditch shall be made under
the supervision of Department of Public Works or Water Department.
F. When a water meter is enclosed or boxed in or installed in underground
pits by the property owners, there must be an opening or access to such
pit of not less than three square feet in order to permit the Water
Department to make readings or repairs. All meters installed in
underground pits must have the location approval of the Department of
Public Works and must be maintained in waterproof condition.
G. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any building except the
Municipal Buildings, unless said building has had a water meter
installed in accordance with this chapter.

1:474
§ 261-4. Separate service for each building required.
Each residence or building shall have its separate service connection direct
to the main.
§ 261-5. Branches.
No branch will be allowed to be inserted in any service pipe without a
written permit from the Water Department. Where branches already exist
not provided with stopcocks, in case of default in payment of water rent by
anyone, the main service may be cut off until the back charges are paid, and
the Department shall not be liable for damages from any other consumer
who may thus be deprived of water.
§ 261-6. Laying of pipes; change of grade.
Service pipes must be laid at least four feet below the surface of the ground.
If at any time it shall become necessary for the Water Department to change
the grade of their mains, the property owner or water user shall lower the
grade of the service pipe and fixtures to conform to such change.
§ 261-7. Inspections; shutoff.
Employees of the Water Department may enter and must be permitted
entrance to any premises where a meter is being supplied, or upon any
premises for which application is made for service, for the purpose of
inspecting all pipes and connections with such water service. Water may be
shut off by the Water Department from any service or main for the purpose
of constructing new work, additions or making repairs to the water system.
Whenever possible, due notice will be given, but in case of emergency,
the water may be shut off without notice, and the Village or the Water
Department shall not be responsible for any damage resulting therefrom.
§ 261-8. Restriction on street openings.
No street openings will be made or permitted between November 1 and
April 1 for the purpose of laying new waterlines, except in the case of
emergency repairs.
§ 261-9. Water service outside Village. [Amended 7-18-1977 by L.L.
No. 5-1977]
No water service shall be supplied to any user outside the corporate limits
of the Village of Suffern except by permission of the Board of Trustees. The
Board of Trustees shall not sell nor permit the use of water pursuant to this
section if thereby the supply for the Village or its inhabitants will not be
sufficient. If the Board of Trustees permits connection with the mains of the
Village for the purpose of drawing water therefrom, it shall fix the prices
and conditions therefor and shall require the applicant to install all pipes,
mains and connections at his own cost and to restore all roads, sidewalks
and other property to their original condition. Said provisions shall not
§ 261-4 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 261-9
1:475
apply to those water users who are presently being supplied water upon the
date of enactment of this section, and they may continue to receive such
water from the Village of Suffern as long as such users comply with the
other provisions of this article.
§ 261-10. Maintenance by owners.
The owner of property into which water is introduced by a service pipe
will be required to maintain at his own cost and expense said service pipe
from the curb box and the curb box and curb stop and fixtures provided for
delivering or supplying water for any purpose. The curb box must be kept in
view and the top thereof even with the sidewalk or street grade at all times
and in a serviceable condition. In the event that service and fixtures are not
kept in good repair, the Village and the Water Department reserve the right
to terminate water service or to make necessary repairs and charge the
costs to the property owner. The service pipes from the water main must be
laid at the proper depth, as indicated in this article. The Water Department
shall not be responsible for the freezing of any service lines.
§ 261-11. Installation, size and type of meters. [Amended 3-12-1990
by L.L. No. 3-1990; 7-20-1992 by L.L. No. 4-1992]
§ 261-12. Rules and charges. [Amended 7-20-1992 by L.L. No.
4-1992]
A. All water meters must be of a type that registers water use in cubic feet
and must be of a type and kind approved by the Department of Public
Works. Plumbers installing house or other plumbing shall leave
sufficient horizontal space between the meter ball valves, the space
being as follows:
Meter

B. On and after the first day of October 1992, all new installations must be
equipped with a Village-approved meter interface unit.
A. The Water Department may refuse to allow the water for such services
to be turned on until this article is complied with. Allowance will not be
made for any water bill where the charges result from failure on the
part of the owner or consumer to properly repair any broken, frozen or
defective fixtures or service. All water passing through a meter will be
charged for, whether used or wasted. If a meter gets out of order and
fails to register, the consumer will be charged at the average
consumption as shown by the meter when in order. All rates are based
§ 261-9 SUFFERN CODE § 261-12
1:476
§ 261-13. Testing of meters; charge; repairs. [Amended 3-12-1990
by L.L. No. 3-1990]
Persons making complaints as to the correctness of water bills and claiming
to be overcharged can, by applying to the Water Department, have the
meter examined and the dial reread or, by deposit of an amount set by
resolution of the Board of Trustees in the Standard Schedule of Fees of
the Village of Suffern136 at the office of the Village Clerk, may have the
meter taken out and tested. If the meter is found to be correct within
3%, the deposit will be retained as payment of the time used in testing
the meter. Should the meter be found to overregister more than 3%, the
deposit will be returned and the proper adjustment made on the bill. The
Water Department will repair all meters size 5/8 inch and 3/4 inch. All
meters larger than 3/4 inch must be repaired by an authorized repair
company under Water Department supervision and paid for by the property
owner. All repairs to meters damaged by negligence, vandalism or freezing
shall be paid for by the property owner. If the meters need attention, the
Water Department should be notified at once. Plumbers are not allowed to
remove meters for repairs or any other purpose. All persons are forbidden
to break meter seals, disconnect or in any way tamper with meters without
permission from the Water Department.
§ 261-14. Issuance of bills. [Amended 12-11-1972; 3-21-1994 by L.L.

§ 261-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 261-15
1:477
§ 261-16. Change of ownership of property.
Water furnished to any property for any purpose stands charged against
such property regardless of change of ownership, and the Water
Department reserves the right to discontinue the service from such
premises for any unpaid bill or bills accumulated by the former owner
or owners and to refuse to turn the same on again until all arrears and
penalties are paid. In the case of a transfer of a property, the Water
Department should be immediately notified so that proper adjustment may
be made of any charges or repair bills against such property. In case the
water is turned off by any agent of the Water Department for proper cause,
no person shall turn water on again without permission from the Water
Department.
§ 261-17. Notice for discontinuance of service.
Persons wishing to discontinue the use of water must give written notice
thereof to the Village Clerk previous to the billing for the current period;
otherwise they will be liable for rent for the ensuing six months.
§ 261-18. Cause for discontinuance of service.
The Superintendent of Public Works may discontinue water service and shut
off the supply from any premises, the owner or occupant of which has failed
to comply with the provisions of any ordinance relating to the character and
construction and maintenance of pipes and connection and the use of the
water or the percentage of waste of water. Such service will not be resumed
until the cause for such discontinuance is removed and the expense of
shutting off and turning on the water, if any, is paid.

Cross-Connection Controls
[Adopted 3-7-2011 by L.L. No. 4-2011]
§ 261-32. Purpose; state regulations; interpretation.
§ 261-33. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
AIR GAP SEPARATION  A physical break between a supply pipe and a
receiving vessel. The air gap shall be at least double the diameter of the
supply pipe, measured vertically above the top rim of the vessel, in no case
less than one inch.
APPROVED CHECK VALVE  A check valve that seats readily and
completely. It must be carefully machined to have free moving parts and
assured watertightness. The face of the closure element and valve seat
must be bronze composition or other noncorrodible material which will seat
tightly under all prevailing conditions of field use. Pins and bushing shall be
of bronze or other noncorrodible, nonsticking material, machined for easy,
dependable operation. The closure element, e.g., clapper, shall be internally
weighted or otherwise internally equipped to promote rapid and positive
closure in all sizes where this feature is obtainable.
APPROVED DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY  An assembly of at least
two independently acting check valves, including tightly closing shutoff
valves on each side of the check valve assembly, and suitable leak detector
drains plus connections available for testing the water tightness of each
check valve. This device must be approved as a complete assembly.
APPROVED REDUCED-PRESSURE-PRINCIPLE BACKFLOW PREVENTION
DEVICE  A device incorporating two or more check valves and an
automatically operating differential relief valve located between the two
checks, two shutoff valves, and equipped with necessary appurtenances
for testing. The device shall operate to maintain the pressure in the zone
A. The purpose of these regulations is to safeguard potable water supplies
by preventing backflow into public water systems.
B. Regulations of the State of New York, Part 5.1-31(a)(2), require that
when a supplier of water instructs the user of a public water supply to
protect his water service connection by the installation of a protective
device, plans for the installation of the protective device must be
submitted to the supplier of water and to the state for approval.
C. The regulations are to be reasonably interpreted. It is the intent of
these regulations to recognize that there are varying degrees of hazard
and to apply the principle that the degree of protection should be
commensurate with the degree of hazard.
§ 261-32 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 261-33
1:483
between the two check valves less than the pressure on the public water
supply side of the device.
APPROVED WATER SUPPLY  Any water supply approved by the New York
State Department of Health.
AUXILIARY SUPPLY  Any water supply on or available to the premises
other than the approved public water supply.
BAROMETRIC LOOP  A loop of pipe rising approximately 35 feet, at its
topmost point, above the highest fixture it supplies.
CERTIFIED BACKFLOW PREVENTION DEVICE TESTER  A person who
has a certificate issued by the State of New York Department of Health for
a backflow prevention device tester. He or she shall be provided with an
appropriate identification card which must be renewed every three years.
Failure to perform his or her duties competently and conscientiously will
result in prompt withdrawal of his or her authority.
CROSS-CONNECTION  Any unprotected connection between any part of
a water system used or intended to supply water for drinking purposes and
any source or system containing water or substance that is not or cannot be
approved as equally safe, wholesome, and potable for human consumption.
VACUUM BREAKER, NON-PRESSURE TYPE  A vacuum breaker which is
designed so as not to be subjected to static line pressure.
VACUUM BREAKER, PRESSURE-TYPE  A vacuum breaker designed to
operate under conditions of static line pressure.
WATER SUPERVISOR  The consumer or a person on the premises charged
with the responsibility of complete knowledge and understanding of the
water supply piping within the premises and for maintaining the consumer's
water system free from cross-connection and other sanitary defects, as
required by regulations and laws.
§ 261-34. Protection of public water system at service connection.
At cessation of normal flow, the pressure between check valves shall
be less than the supply pressure. In case of leakage of either check
valve, the differential relief valve shall operate to maintain this reduced
pressure by discharging to the atmosphere. When the inlet pressure is
two pounds per square inch or less, the relief valve shall open to the
atmosphere, thereby providing an air gap in the device. To be approved,
these devices must be readily accessible for maintenance and testing
and installed in a location where no part of the valve will be submerged.
The enclosure must be self-draining, so that the large amount of water
which the relief valve may vent will be disposed of reliably without
submergence of the relief valve.
A.
B. This device must also be approved as a complete assembly.
A. Where protection is required.
§ 261-33 SUFFERN CODE § 261-34
1:484
(1) Each service connection from a public water system for supplying
water to premises having an auxiliary water supply shall be
protected against backflow of water from the premises into the
public water system, unless the auxiliary water supply is approved
as an additional source by the water purveyor and is satisfactory to
the public health agency having jurisdiction with regard to quality
and safety. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly
prohibited and illegal to allow any well water not under the control
of the Village within the Village of Suffern.
(2) Each service connection from a public water system for supplying
water to premises on which any substance is handled under
pressure in such fashion as to permit entry into the water system
shall be protected against backflow of the water from the premises
into the public waters and waters originating from the public water
supply system which may have been subject to deterioration in
sanitary or chemical quality.
(3) Each service connection from a public water system for supplying
water to premises on which a substance of unusually toxic
concentration or danger to health is handled in liquid form, even
though it is not under pressure, shall be protected against backflow
of the water from premises into the public system. Examples are
hospitals and plating factories using cyanide. This is not intended
to apply to normal household installations.
(4) Backflow prevention devices shall be installed on the service
connection to any premises that have internal cross-connections,
unless such cross-connections are abated to the satisfaction of the
water purveyor. It shall be the responsibility of the water user to
provide and maintain these protective devices, and each one must
be of a type acceptable to the State Health Department.
B. Type of protection. The protective device required shall depend on the
degree of hazard as tabulated below.
(1) At the service connection to any premises where there is an
auxiliary water supply handled in a separate piping system with no
known cross-connection, the public water supply shall be protected
by an approved double-check valve assembly.
(2) At the service connection on any premises on which there is an
auxiliary water supply where cross-connections are known to exist
which cannot be presently eliminated, the public water supply
system shall be protected by an air gap separation or an approved
reduced-pressure-principle backflow prevention device.
(3) At the service connection to any premises on which a substance
that would be objectionable but not necessarily hazardous to health
if introduced into the public water supply is handled so as to
constitute a cross-connection, the public water supply shall be
protected by an approved double-check valve assembly.
§ 261-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 261-34
1:485
§ 261-35. Protection of potable water system within premises.
(4) At the service connection to any premises on which a substance of
unusual toxic concentration or danger to health is or may be
handled, but not under pressure, the public water supply shall be
protected by an air gap separation or an approved reducedpressure-
principle backflow prevention device. This device shall be
located as close as practicable to the water meter, and all piping
between the water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely
visible.
(5) At the service connection to any premises on which any material
dangerous to health, or toxic substance in toxic concentration, is or
may be handled under pressure, the public water supply shall be
protected by an air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as
close as practicable to the water meter, and all piping between the
water meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible. If these
conditions cannot reasonably be met, the public water supply shall
be protected with an approved reduced-pressure-principle
backflow prevention device, providing the alternative is acceptable
to the water purveyor.
(6) At the service connection to any sewage treatment plant or sewage
pumping station, the public water supply shall be protected by an
air gap separation. The air gap shall be located as close as
practicable to the water meter, and all piping between the water
meter and receiving tanks shall be entirely visible. If these
conditions cannot be reasonably met, the public water supply shall
be protected with an approved reduced-pressure-principle
backflow prevention device.
C. Frequency of inspection of protective devices.
(1) It shall be the duty of the water user on any premises on account of
which backflow protective devices are installed to have competent
inspections made at least once a year, or more often in those
instances where successive inspections indicate repeated failure.
These devices shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced at the
expense of the water user whenever they are found to be defective.
These tests shall be performed by a qualified backflow prevention
tester, and all test results will be provided to the water purveyor
within 72 hours after the test is made.
(2) Records of such tests, repairs, and overhaul shall also be kept and
made available to the water purveyor and the local Health
Department upon request.
A. Separate drinking water systems. Whenever the Chief Operator of
Water Distribution or Director of Public Works determines that it is not
practical to protect drinking water systems on premises against entry of
water from a source or piping system or equipment that cannot be
§ 261-34 SUFFERN CODE § 261-35
1:486
approved as safe or potable for human use, an entirely separate
drinking water system shall be installed to supply water at points
convenient for consumers.
B. Fire systems. Water systems for fighting fire, derived from a supply that
cannot be approved as safe or potable for human use, shall, wherever
practicable, be kept wholly separate from drinking water pipelines and
equipment. In cases where the domestic water system is used for both
drinking and fire-fighting purposes, approved backflow prevention
devices shall be installed to protect such individual drinking water lines
as are not used for fire-fighting purposes. Any auxiliary fire-fighting
water supply which is not approved for potable purposes but which is so
connected that it may be introduced into potable water piping during an
emergency shall be equipped with an approved automatic chlorination
machine. It is hereby declared that it is the responsibility of the person
or persons causing the introduction of said unapproved or unsafe water
into the pipelines to see that a procedure is developed and carried out
to notify and protect users of this piping system during the emergency
and that special precautions are taken to disinfect thoroughly and flush
out all pipelines which may become contaminated before they are again
used to furnish drinking water. In the event the means of protection of
water consumers is by disinfection of the auxiliary fire-fighting supply,
the installation and its use shall be thoroughly reliable. The public
water supply must be protected against backflow from such dual
domestic fire systems, as detailed in Article II of this chapter.
C. Process waters.
(1) Potable water pipelines connected to equipment for industrial
processes or operations shall be protected by a suitable backflow
prevention device located beyond the last point from which
drinking water may be taken, which device shall be provided on the
feed line to process piping or equipment.
(2) In the event the particular process liquid is especially corrosive or
apt to prevent reliable action of the backflow prevention device, air
gap separation shall be provided. These devices shall be tested by
the water user at least once a year or more often in those instances
where successive inspections indicate repeated failure. The devices
shall be repaired, overhauled or replaced whenever they are found
to be defective. These tests must be performed by a qualified
backflow prevention device tester, and records of tests, repairs,
and replacement shall be kept and made available to the water
purveyor and the Health Department upon request.
D. Sewage treatment plants and pumping stations. Sewage pumps shall
not have priming connections directly off any drinking water systems.
No connections shall exist between the drinking water system and any
other piping, equipment, or tank in any sewage treatment plant or
sewage pumping station.
§ 261-35 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 261-35
1:487
E. Plumbing connections.
(1) Where the circumstances are such that there is special danger to
health by the backflow of sewage, as from sewers, toilets, hospital
bedpans and the like, into a drinking water system, a dependable
device or devices shall be installed to prevent such backflow.
(2) The purpose of these regulations is not to transcend local plumbing
regulations but only to deal with those extraordinary situations
where sewage may be forced or drawn into the drinking water
piping. These regulations do not attempt to eliminate at this time
the hazards of back siphonage through Flushometer valves on all
toilets but deal with those situations where the likelihood of
vacuum conditions in the drinking water system is definite and
there is special danger to health. Devices suited to the purpose of
avoiding back siphonage from plumbing fixtures are roof tanks,
barometric loops or separate pressure systems separately piped to
supply such fixtures, recognized approved vacuum or siphon
breakers and other backflow protection devices which have been
proved by appropriate tests to be dependable for destroying the
vacuum.
(3) Inasmuch as many serious hazards of this kind are due to water
supply piping which is too small, thereby causing vacuum
conditions when fixtures are flushed or water is drawn from the
system in other ways, it is recommended that water supply piping
that is too small be enlarged whenever possible.
F. Marking safe and unsafe waterlines.
(1) Where the premises contain dual or multiple water systems and
piping, the exposed portions of pipelines shall be painted, banded
or marked at sufficient intervals to distinguish clearly which water
is safe and which is not safe. All outlets from secondary or other
potentially contaminated systems shall be posted as being
contaminated and unsafe for drinking purposes. All outlets
intended for drinking purposes shall be plainly marked to indicate
that fact.
(2) Water supervisor. The local Health Department and the water
purveyor shall be kept informed of the identity of the person
responsible for the water piping on all premises concerned with
these regulations. At each premises where it is necessary in the
opinion of the water purveyor, a water supervisor shall be
designated. This water supervisor shall be responsible for the
installation and use of pipelines and equipment and for the
avoidance of cross-connections.
(3) In the event of contamination or pollution of the drinking water
system due to a cross-connection on the premises, the local health
officer and water purveyor shall be promptly advised by the person
§ 261-35 SUFFERN CODE § 261-35
1:488
§ 261-36. Recourse for noncompliance.
§ 261-37. Contents of application.
All applications must be accompanied by plans, specifications and an
engineer's or architect's report describing the project in detail. The
application must be signed by a New-York-State-registered professional
engineer or architect. The project must first be submitted to the water
supplier, who will forward it to the local public health engineer. This form
must be prepared in quadruplicate with four copies of all plans,
specifications and descriptive literature. Electronic versions of this
information may be submitted.
§ 261-38. Examples of cross-connection hazards.

of such person, setting forth specifically that water service may be
terminated if the violation is not corrected. If the violation is not
rectified within the time provided in said notice, the
Superintendent of Public Works may cause a notification of
termination of water service to be served on the property owner
and occupants in the same manner setting forth the date of
termination, at least 20 days hence.
(2) The notice of termination shall state that the owner or occupant of
the affected premises shall be entitled to a due process fair
hearing, prior to the termination of service. The owner or occupant
of the premises which will be affected by the termination of service
shall notify the Village Clerk that they request a fair hearing prior
to the termination of service. Said notification of the Village Clerk
shall be in writing and shall be delivered to the Village Clerk within
10 days of the receipt of the notice that the water services will be
terminated. The Board of Trustees shall hear said appeal or may
designate a hearing officer. Said hearing and decision must be
finalized prior to the termination of any water service by the Village
Water Department.

Statement of Purposes
§ 266-1. Purpose.
Under the authority granted by § 7-700 of the Village Law as amended,
§§ 10, Subdivision 1(ii)e, of the Municipal Home Rule Law and § 10,
Subdivision 6, of the Statute of Local Governments, the Board of Trustees of
the Village of Suffern hereby adopts this chapter, hereinafter referred to as
the "Zoning Law," to promote the purposes set forth in § 7-704 of the Village
Law, including the following:
A. To guide the future growth and development of the Village of Suffern in
accordance with a well considered plan, which plan is embodied in this
Zoning Law.
B. To regulate and limit the height, bulk and location of buildings
hereafter erected, to regulate and determine the area of yards, courts
and other open space and to regulate the density of population in any
given area and, for said purposes, to divide the Village into zoning
districts. These regulations are uniform for each class of buildings
throughout any district, but the regulations in each district differ from
those in other districts. These regulations are designed to secure safety
from fire, flood and other dangers and to promote the public health and
welfare, including, so far as conditions permit, provision for adequate

reconstruction is commenced within one year of the date of such
damage, and further provided that it shall be reconstructed in
accordance with a plan approved by the Planning Board, where the
Planning Board has original jurisdiction, so as to result, where
reasonable, in greater conformity with this Zoning Law.
E. Change to other nonconforming use. On application, any
nonconforming use of land, buildings or structures may be changed to
another nonconforming use, upon approval by the Board of Appeals,
based upon a finding that the proposed use is more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such
change, the Board of Appeals may impose whatever conditions and
safeguards it may deem necessary or appropriate, including site plan
approval by the Planning Board to further the purposes of this Zoning
Law.
F. Improvement of nonconforming uses. In order that nonconforming uses
may gradually be brought into greater conformity with this Zoning Law
and the adverse external effects of such nonconforming uses may be
§ 266-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-14
1:519
reduced, the owner of the land, building or structure so used may be
permitted to make limited changes to such building, structure or use
in conjunction with a site plan approval whereby, through landscaped
screening and buffer areas, control of noise, smoke, odors, lighting,
architectural changes, location and layout of parking areas and access
drives or by any other appropriate means, these purposes may be
achieved. An application for approval for such plan shall be made to
the Planning Board which may then grant approval or approval with
modifications, provided that they find that the purposes of this section
shall be met.
G. Residential uses in the PO-15 District.
(1) As-of-right residential uses lawfully existing at the date of adoption
of this section of the Zoning Law in the PO-15 District are deemed
to be permitted as-of-right.

deemed to be nonresidential uses for the purposes of this section.
§ 266-15 SUFFERN CODE § 266-16
1:528
B. Purposes. Consistent with the general purposes of this Zoning Law,
performance standards shall set specific controls on potentially
objectionable external aspects of nonresidential uses so as to:
(1) Reduce to a reasonable minimum the dissemination of smoke, gas,
dust, odor or other atmospheric pollutants outside the building in
which the use is conducted.
(2) Prevent the discharge of untreated or insufficiently treated wastes
into any watercourse.
(3) Prevent the dissemination of vibration, heat, noise or
electromagnetic interference beyond the immediate site on which
the use is located.
(4) Prevent physical hazard by reason of fire, explosion, radiation or
any similar cause.
C. Standards for noise.
(1) Method of measurement. For the purpose of measuring the
intensity and frequencies of sound, sound level meters and octave
band filters shall be employed. Octave band analyzers calibrated
with pre-1960 octave bands (American Standards Association
Z24.10-1953, Octave Band Filter Set) shall be used. Sounds of
short duration, which cannot be measured accurately with the
sound level meter, shall be measured with an impact noise filter in
order to determine the peak value of the impact.
(2) Maximum permitted sound pressure level. The decibels resulting
from any activity, whether open or enclosed, shall not exceed at any
point, on or beyond any lot line, the maximum decibel level for the
designated octave band as set forth in the following table, except
that where the lot lies within 200 feet of a residence district,
whether within or without the Village, the maximum permitted
decibel level at any point on or beyond the district boundary shall
be reduced by six decibels from the maximum permitted level set
forth in the table, and further, except that such reduction shall also
apply to any sound emitted between the hours of 6:00 p.m. and
8:00 a.m., and between 6:00 p.m. and 10:00 a.m. on weekends and
holidays.

the noise level regulations:
(a) Noises not directly under the control of the property user.
(b) Noises emanating from construction and maintenance
activities between 8:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays.
(c) The noises of safety signals, warning devices, emergency
pressure relief valves or other emergency warning signals.
(d) Transient noises of moving sources, such as automobiles,
trucks, airplanes and railroads.
D. Standards for vibration.
(1) Method of measurement. For the purpose of measuring vibration, a
two-component measuring system approved by the Village
Engineer shall be employed.
(2) Maximum permitted steady state and impact vibration
displacement. No activity shall cause or create a steady state or
impact vibration on any lot line with a vibration displacement by
frequency bands in excess of that indicated in the following table:
Vibration Displacement
(in inches)

40 and over 0.0001 0.0002
E. Standards for smoke, dust and other atmospheric pollutants.
(1) General control. The emission of smoke and other particulate
matter shall not be permitted, regardless of quantity, if it will be in
§ 266-16 SUFFERN CODE § 266-16
1:530
any way detrimental to the public health, safety, welfare or comfort
or a source of damage to property.
(2) Method of measurement of smoke. For the purpose of grading the
density of smoke, the Ringelmann Smoke Chart shall be used to
determine the total smoke units emitted. A reading shall be taken
every minute for an hour. Each reading shall be multiplied by the
number of minutes during which it was observed and the product
added.
(3) Maximum permitted emission of smoke. There shall be no
measurable emission of smoke, gas or other atmospheric pollutant.
The emission of one smoke unit per hour and smoke with
discernible density of Number 1 on the Ringelmann Smoke Chart
shall be prohibited.
(4) Maximum permitted emission of dust. No emission of fly ash, dust,
fumes, vapors, gases and other forms of air pollution shall be
permitted which can cause any damage to health, to animals or
vegetation or to other forms of property or which can cause any
excessive soiling of any paint; and in no event shall any emission of
any solid or liquid particles in concentrations exceeding 0.3 grain
per cubic foot of the conveying gas or air at any point be permitted.
For measurement of the amount of gases resulting from
combustion, standard corrections shall be applied to a stack
temperature of 500° F. and 50% excess air.
F. Standards for odorous matter. No land use shall be permitted which
results in the creation of odors discernible beyond the lot line which are
of such intensity and character as to be detrimental to the health and
safety of the public or which interfere unreasonably with the comfort of
the public.
G. Standards for toxic matter. No use shall be permitted which will cause
any dissemination whatsoever of toxic or noxious matter beyond the lot
on which the use is conducted or impregnate the soil to a depth of more
than three inches. For the purpose of this section, "toxic or noxious
matter" is defined as any solid, liquid or gaseous matter, including, but
not limited to, gases, vapors, dusts, fumes and mists containing
properties which by chemical means are:
(1) Inherently harmful and likely to destroy life or impair health; or
(2) Likely to cause injury to the well-being of persons or damage to
property.
H. Standards for radiation and electromagnetic interference.
(1) Radiation. The handling, storage or disposal of radioactive

§ 266-17. Floodplain District.
A. Purposes. The unmanageable use, alteration of topography, excessive
filling, channel encroachment or other acts affect the natural discharge
of water through floodplains and constitute a threat to the health,
safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the Village of Suffern and to the
economic vitality of the community. The purpose of the Floodplain
District is to protect the health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of
the Village of Suffern from hazards due to periodic flooding. This shall
include the protection of persons and property, the preservation of
water quality and the minimizing of expenditures for personal loss,
property damage, insurance and flood control projects.
B. Restrictions. No structure (temporary or permanent), fill for any
purpose, deposit, obstruction, storage of materials or equipment or
other uses shall be permitted which, acting alone or in combination
with existing or future uses, will adversely affect the efficiency or the
capacity of the floodway or increase flood heights, cause increased
velocities or obstruct or otherwise catch or collect debris which will
obstruct flow under flood conditions.
C. Application to the Planning Board. All uses in the Floodplain District
require the issuance of a special permit by the Planning Board pursuant
to the requirements of Article VI of this Zoning Law. The Planning
Board shall require that the applicant submit a plan certified by a
registered professional engineer that the floodproofing measures are
consistent with the flood protection elevation and associated flood
factors for the particular area. Floodproofing measures may be
required for all buildings and structures, other than those which have a
low flood damage potential. Such measures may include the following
where appropriate:
(1) Anchorage to resist flotation and lateral movement.
(2) Reinforcement of walls to resist water pressure.
(3) Installation of watertight doors, bulkheads and shutters.
(4) Use of paints, membranes or mortars to reduce seepage of water
through walls.
(5) Addition of mass or weight to resist flotation.
(6) Installation of pumps to lower water levels in structures.
(7) Construction of water supply and waste treatment systems so as to
prevent the entrance of floodwaters.
(8) Pumping facilities to relieve hydrostatic water pressure on external
walls and basement floors.
(9) Elimination of gravity flow drains.
§ 266-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-17
1:533
(10) Construction to resist rupture or collapse caused by water pressure
or floating debris.
(11)Raising of structures to or above the necessary flood protection
elevation.
D. Flood fringe development standards. If the Planning Board finds, by
virtue of engineering data supplied to it by the applicant, that the area
lies in the fringe of the floodway, otherwise known as the "flood fringe
area," the Planning Board shall not grant such special permit for any
use permitted in such an area unless it meets the following
requirements in addition to those otherwise applicable to it under this
Zoning Law.
(1) New or replacement water supply systems shall be so designed as
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system
and discharges from the systems into floodwaters.
(2) Sanitary waste disposal systems shall be located so as to avoid
impairment of or contamination from the systems during flooding.
(3) Any structure built on pilings shall be constructed with the lowest
floor elevated to at least one foot above the base flood level; or
(4) Any structure built on fill shall be constructed so that the first floor
and basement floor are one foot above the base flood elevation. The
fill shall be at a point no lower than one foot below the regulatory
flood-protection elevation at least 15 feet beyond the limits of any
structure or building erected thereon. However, no use shall be
constructed which will adversely affect the capacity of channels or
floodways of any tributary to the main stream, drainage ditch or
any other drainage facility or system.
E. Floodway development standards. If the Planning Board finds, by virtue
of the engineering data supplied to it by the applicant, that the area lies
in the floodway, the Planning Board shall not grant such special permit
for any use permitted in such an area unless it meets the following
requirements in addition to those in § 266-17D of this Zoning Law and
those otherwise applicable to it under this Zoning Law.
(1) Structures shall not be used for human habitation.
(2) All structures shall have a low flood damage potential, shall be
constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the
minimum obstruction to the flow of floodwater (i.e., longitudinal
axis parallel to the direction of flood flow and approximately on the
same flow lines as those adjoining structures).
(3) Structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation,
particularly where damage may result to other structures, or
restrictions created at bridge openings and other narrowing of
streams or rivers.

§ 266-18. Critical Environmental Area Overlay District. [Added
11-10-2005 by L.L. No. 8-2005]
(4) Service facilities, such as electrical or heating equipment, shall be
constructed at or above the flood protection elevation for the
particular area or shall be floodproofed. Absolute measures will be
required to prevent explosion potential (boilers) or contamination
of floodwaters by toxic chemicals.
F. Authorization to grant or deny special uses. The special permit uses
listed for this district may be permitted, enlarged or otherwise altered
upon authorization by the Planning Board in accordance with the
standards and protections set forth in this section and such additional
standards as may be set forth for such special uses elsewhere in this
Zoning Law. In permitting a special use or the modification of a special
use, the Planning Board may impose, in addition to those standards and
requirements expressly specified by the Zoning Law, any additional
conditions which the Planning Board considers necessary to protect the
best interests of the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the
Village as a whole. These conditions may include controlling the
location and number of vehicle access points, limiting the number, size
and location of signs and requiring diking, fencing, screening,
landscaping or other facilities to protect adjacent or nearby property.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Critical Environmental Area Overlay
District is to provide an additional measure of review of development
proposals on those remaining undeveloped and underdeveloped lands
with sensitive environmental features, and to encourage flexibility in
layout to best protect sensitive environmental features and to minimize
adverse environmental impacts on neighboring properties or the
Village as a whole.
B. Objectives.
(1) To retain areas adjacent to locations subject to frequent flooding
and floodplains in their natural state to the maximum extent
possible, to preserve water quality, to protect water retention
capabilities, and to facilitate recharge of the water table.
(2) To protect areas generally recognized for vegetative features or
ecological communities, including natural vegetation along lakes,
rivers, floodplains, wetlands and streams, woodlands and stands of
trees.
(3) To protect and enhance scenic resources, including landscapes,
woodlands, meadows, and other environmental features that have a
special scenic character or an historic or aesthetic interest or
value.
§ 266-17 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-18
1:535
(4) To connect open spaces with each other to the greatest extent
possible to allow for the preservation of habitat and other
environmental features.
(5) To help protect uses that may be dissimilar from one another by
providing wooded buffers to reduce visual and sound impacts and
to allow for increased levels of privacy, particularly for residences
adjacent to public or nonresidential uses.
C. Application to the Board of Trustees. All uses in the Critical
Environmental Area Overlay District require the issuance of a special
permit by the Board of Trustees pursuant to the requirements of Article
VI of this Zoning Law. The Board of Trustees shall consider the
following standards in reviewing applications, but shall not be limited
to these standards, and may consider any factor related to the health,
safety or general welfare of the residents of the Village of Suffern and, if
appropriate, neighboring communities.
(1) The cluster technique shall be considered for all properties shown
on the Critical Environmental Area Map adopted as part of the
Zoning Law.
(2) The Planning Board must obtain authorization from the Board of
Trustees for each application for development in the Critical
Environmental Area Overlay District if cluster zoning is to be
employed.
(3) The Planning Board or Board of Trustees may require the use of the
cluster technique for a particular application based on a statement
of the objectives sought to be achieved.
(4) Areas of utility rights-of-way and designated streets, land under
water, steep slopes, wetlands and any required control areas,
streams, and rock outcrops shall be excluded from the land areas
used for development in the calculation of permitted densities for
construction notwithstanding the fifty-percent provision in
§ 266-15N of the Village Code.

characteristic, represents an established and familiar visual
feature of the neighborhood.
(2) A group of properties may be designated as an historic district if:
(a) It contains properties which meet one or more of the criteria
for designation of a landmark; or
(b) By reason of possessing such qualities, it constitutes a distinct
section of the Village of Suffern.
E. Regulated activities.
(1) Upon receipt of notice that the Planning Board is considering a
property or building for designation as a landmark or as part of an
historic district, the Building Inspector shall not issue any permit
for the demolition, alteration or improvement of said property or
building for a period of 60 days, commencing upon said notice,
unless, prior to the expiration of said time period, there is a final
determination by the Planning Board that said property or building
has not qualified as a landmark or historic district. If, within said
period, the Planning Board has made a recommendation to the
Village Board to designate the property in question as a landmark
or historic district, no building or demolition permit shall be issued
except pursuant to § 266-19G of this Zoning Law.

1:539
(3) No person shall carry out any exterior alteration, restoration,
reconstruction, demolition, new construction or moving of a
landmark or property within an historic district, nor shall any
person make any material change in the appearance of such
property, its light fixtures, signs, sidewalks, fences, steps, paving or
other exterior elements visible from a public street or alley which
affect the appearance and cohesiveness of the historic district,
without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness from the
Planning Board.
(4) The Planning Board shall review all plans for the moving, exterior
construction, alterations or repair, landscaping or demolition of a
property or building designated as a landmark or located wholly or
partially within an historic district. It shall be the duty of the
Planning Board to review and approve such plans before the
proposed activity is granted a building permit by the Building
Inspector.
F. Standards for decision.
(1) In passing upon an application for a certificate of appropriateness,
the Planning Board shall not consider changes to interior spaces,
unless they are open to the public, or to architectural features that
are not visible from a public street or alley. The Planning Board's
decision shall be based on the following principles:
(a) Properties which contribute to the character of the historic
district shall be retained, with their historic district features
altered as little as possible.
(b) Any alteration of existing properties shall be compatible with
their historic character, as well as with the surrounding
district.
(c) New construction shall be compatible with the district in which
it is located.
(2) In applying the principle of compatibility, the Planning Board shall
consider the following factors:
(a) The general design, character and appropriateness to the
property of the proposed alteration or new construction.
(b) The scale of the proposed alteration or new construction in
relation to the property itself, surrounding properties and the
neighborhood.
(c) Texture, materials and color and their relation to similar
features of other properties in the neighborhood.
(d) Visual compatibility with surrounding properties, including
proportion of the property's front facade, proportion and
arrangement of windows and other openings within the facade,
§ 266-19 SUFFERN CODE § 266-19
1:540
roof shape and the rhythm of spacing of properties on streets,
including setback.
(e) The importance of historic, architectural or other features to
the significance of the property.
G. Certificate of appropriateness application procedure.
(1) Prior to the commencement of any work requiring a certificate of
appropriateness, the owner shall file an application for such a
certificate with the Planning Board. The application shall contain
the following, unless waived by the Planning Board on the basis of
its nonapplicability to the proposed action:
(a) The name, address, location and telephone number of the
applicant.
(b) Location and photographs of the property.
(c) Elevation drawings of proposed changes.
(d) Perspective drawings, including relationship to adjacent
properties.
(e) Samples of colors or materials to be used.
(f) Where the proposal includes signs or lettering, a scale drawing
showing the type of lettering to be used, all dimensions and
colors, a description of the materials to be used, method of
illumination and a plan showing the sign's location on the
property.
(g) Any other information which the Planning Board may deem
necessary in order to visualize the proposed work.
(2) No building permit shall be issued for such proposed work until a
certificate of appropriateness has first been issued by the Planning
Board. The certificate of appropriateness required by this Zoning
Law shall be in addition to and not in lieu of any building permit
that may be required by any other zoning law of the Village of
Suffern.
(3) The Planning Board shall review the application in accordance with
the provisions of this section. In reviewing the plans, the Planning
Board may confer with the applicant or his authorized
representative concerning the application.

considering any such application, the Board shall bear in mind the
purpose of this section and shall give consideration to any report of
local historical societies and advice of the Village Historian relating
to the general design, arrangement, architectural style, texture,
material and colors of the building or structures in question, the
location on the plot of ground and the relation of such features
to other buildings, structures, trees or other forms of growth,
landmarks, public or private roads and all other such factors
pertaining to the renovation, installation or conservation of any
building or improvement which would be obviously incongruous
with the historic aspects of the surrounding area.
(6) The Board shall approve, modify and approve or disapprove such
plans within 60 days after receipt of a complete application. The
decision of the Planning Board shall be in writing. A copy shall be
sent to the applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the
Village Clerk.
(7) The determination of the Planning Board shall set forth the reasons
for such determination. The Planning Board shall give notice of any
such determination to the applicant. Such notice shall include a
copy of such determination. Any such determination may prescribe
conditions under which the proposed work shall be done, in order
to effectuate the purposes of this section, and shall include
recommendations by the Board as to the performance of such work.
The Planning Board shall promptly transmit notice of such
determination to the Building Inspector.
H. Hardship criteria.
(1) An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed
demolition has been denied may apply to the Planning Board for
relief on the ground of hardship. In order to prove the existence of
hardship, the applicant shall establish that:
(a) The property is incapable of earning a reasonable return,
regardless of whether that return represents the most
profitable return possible.
(b) The property cannot be adapted for any other use, whether by
the current owner or by a purchaser, which would result in a
reasonable return.
(c) Efforts to find a purchaser interested in acquiring the property
and preserving it have failed.
(2) An applicant whose certificate of appropriateness for a proposed
alteration has been denied may apply for relief on the ground of
hardship. In order to prove the existence of hardship, the applicant
shall establish that the property is incapable of earning a
§ 266-19 SUFFERN CODE § 266-19
1:542
reasonable return, regardless of whether that return represents
the most profitable return possible.
I. Hardship application procedure.
(1) After receiving notification from the Planning Board of the denial of
a certificate of appropriateness, an applicant may commence the
hardship process. No building permit or demolition permit shall be
issued unless the Planning Board makes a determination that a
hardship exists.
(2) The Planning Board may hold a public hearing on the hardship
application at which an opportunity will be provided for proponents
and opponents of the application to present their views.
(3) The applicant shall consult in good faith with the Planning Board,
local preservation groups and interested parties in a diligent effort
to seek an alternative that will result in the preservation of the
property.
(4) All decisions of the Planning Board shall be in writing. A copy shall
be sent to the applicant by registered mail and a copy filed with the
Village Clerk. The Planning Board's decision shall state the reasons
for granting or denying the hardship application.
J. Building permits issued and enforcement.
(1) The Building Inspector shall not grant a building permit until such
time that a certificate of appropriateness or certificate of hardship
has been granted by the Planning Board. In no case shall a permit
be issued prior to site plan approval by the Planning Board.
(2) All work performed pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness
issued under this Zoning Law shall conform to any conditions
included therein. It shall be the duty of the Building Inspector to
inspect periodically any such work to assure compliance. In the
event that work is found that is not being performed in accordance
with the certificate of appropriateness or upon notification of such
fact by the Planning Board, the Building Inspector shall issue a
stop-work order and all work shall immediately cease. No further
work shall be undertaken on the project as long as the stop-work
order is in effect.
K. Maintenance and repair of landmarks, landmarks sites or structures in
historic districts.
(1) Nothing in this Zoning Law shall be construed to prevent ordinary
maintenance or repair with like materials of similar quality and
color of any place, site, structure or building designated as a
landmark or landmark site or any property located wholly or partly
within the boundaries of an historic district.
§ 266-19 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-19
1:543
§ 266-20. Required front yards and maximum height.
(2) No owner or person with an interest in real property designated as
a landmark or included within an historic district shall permit the
property to fall into a serious state of disrepair so as to result in the
deterioration of an exterior architectural feature which would, in
the judgment of the Planning Board, produce a detrimental effect
upon the character of the historic district as a whole or the life and
character of the property itself.
L. Enforcement of directives against unsafe conditions. This section shall
not apply in any case where the Building Inspector or any authorized
Village enforcement agency orders or directs the construction, removal,
alteration or demolition of any improvement on a landmark site or in an
historic district for the purpose of remedying conditions determined to
be unsafe or dangerous to the life, health or property of any person.
M. Violations. Failure to comply with any provisions of this section shall be
deemed a violation and the violator shall be fined in accordance with
the regulations contained in § 266-51 of this Zoning Law.
N. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Planning Board
relating to hardship or a certificate of appropriateness may, within 30
days of filing the decision with the Village Clerk, commence an Article
78 proceeding.
A. All required front yard depths and all maximum heights based on front
lot lines contained in § 266-23 of this Zoning Law shall be measured
from a line hereby established as the designated street line, which shall
be parallel to the street center line and at the distance from such street
center line specified below for each street classification as established

B. This procedure shall be applicable only to lands zoned for residential
purposes, and its application shall result in a permitted number of
building lots or dwelling units which shall in no case exceed the number
which could be permitted, in the Planning Board's judgment, if the land
were subdivided into lots conforming to the minimum lot size and
density requirements of the Zoning Law applicable to the district or
districts in which such land is situated and conforming to all other
applicable requirements; provided, however, that where the plat falls
within two or more districts with differing density requirements, the
Planning Board may approve in any one such district a cluster
development representing the cumulative density as derived from the
summing of all units allowed in all such districts. The dwelling units
shall not be located in areas with impediments listed in § 266-15N of
this Zoning Law.
C. In the case of a residential plat or plats, the dwelling units may be, at
the discretion of the Planning Board and subject to the conditions set
forth by the Board of Trustees, in detached, semidetached, attached or
multistory structures.
D. In the event that the application of this procedure results in a plat
showing lands available for park, recreation, open space or other
municipal purposes directly related to the plat, then the Planning
Board, as a condition of plat approval, may establish such conditions on
the ownership, use and maintenance of such lands as it deems
necessary to assure the preservation of such lands for their intended
purposes. Any conditions relating to Village ownership of the lands shall
be approved by the Village Board prior to the Planning Board granting
final approval to the plat.

copy shall be filed with the Village Clerk, who shall make appropriate
notations and references thereto on the Village Zoning Map.155
G. The provisions of this section shall not be deemed to authorize a change
in the permissible use of such lands as provided in the Zoning Law
applicable to such lands.
H. The authorization herein shall apply to all lands within the incorporated
Village of Suffern.
A. On contiguous parcels of land under single ownership consisting of at

building shall be 110 feet, exclusive of permitted height exceptions as
set forth in § 266-15J herein. In the event that an application shall
propose a plan of development seeking approval of a building in excess
of 40 feet, the required building setbacks as set forth in § 266-23 shall
be subject to the following requirements:
(1) If the building height of the proposed building shall be greater than
40 feet, the required building setback shall be equal to 125% of the

§ 266-21.2. Scenic Overlay District. [Added 4-6-2009 by L.L. No.
3-2009]
No subdivision of property, construction or material alteration of any
principal or accessory use within the Scenic Overlay District is permitted
unless said use shall have obtained approval as set forth below. Exceptions
to this are as-of-right accessory improvements such as decks and pools.
A. If it is determined that the use is subject to site development plan
approval, such use shall receive plan approval from the Planning Board
together with the site development plan approval in conformity with the
regulations set forth below in § 266-21.2C and D.
B. All other uses shall be subject to review and approval by the Building
Inspector. The Building Inspector shall issue a building permit upon a
determination of compliance with the regulation set forth below in
§ 266-21.2C and D and other applicable zoning and Building Code
requirements.
C. Review standards. In order to grant approval, the Building Inspector or
Planning Board, whichever is applicable, must find that such structure
or alteration is architecturally compatible with surrounding structures
and that the important scenic and natural features of the site will be
substantially preserved. To the extent practicable, all structures to be
built on land within the Suffern Scenic Overlay District shall be sited
and clustered on the tract in such a way as to avoid or minimize the
obstructing of scenic overlays in this district.
D. Additional standards of review. The additional regulations set forth
below supplement, but do not replace, the use and bulk regulations
otherwise applicable to the underlying zoning districts.
(1) The minimum front yard requirement, as set forth for the
applicable underlying zoning district, may be increased for all
structures and parking areas located within the Suffern Scenic
Overlay District. The side and rear yard may also be increased by
the Planning Board if there are historic or scenic resources which
are to be protected. The intent is to maintain the existing yards as
to the maximum extent. The Planning Board may require the
applicant to document the yards of all properties on the block in
which the parcel is located to determine the appropriate yard
dimension.
(2) The Planning Board may require that the front yard shall be
managed by the property owner in a way that preserves significant
existing vegetation, plant specimens, landforms and water
features; nurtures tree planting and other natural landscaping
efforts; creates dense landscaping buffers; preserves stone walls,
existing fields and similar features; and/or ensures both the
protection of visual buffers and the prominence of key scenic vistas,
including views of historic properties and landscapes.
§ 266-21.2 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-21.2
1:547
(3) Any necessary intrusions within the front yard area shall be
reduced to the extent practicable by such measures as common
driveways and shared utility services for building sites that may
gain access from the roadways in the Suffern Scenic Overlay
District.
(4) Cluster subdivisions, where appropriate, in accordance with the
Village Law of the State of New York, shall be the preferred
residential land development technique for lands within, adjacent
to or affecting the overall character of a Suffern Scenic Overlay
District, provided that:
(a) All structures and/or parking areas are effectively screened on
a year-round basis by existing landform and/or vegetation or by
substantial new planting and berming as viewed from the
public right-of-way, provided that such treatment does not
diminish the prominence of key scenic vistas including views of
historic properties and landscapes.
(b) A conservation easement, satisfactory to the approving
authority, is granted by the landowner to the Village, a land
trust or similarly qualified entity to ensure that the screening
will be properly maintained and managed or a similarly binding
mechanism as acceptable to the Village Attorney shall be
provided.
(5) Existing vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible. Every attempt shall be made to limit cutting so as to
maintain native vegetation as a screen for structures as seen from
roads, parks and other public overlays within the Suffern Scenic
Overlay District.
(6) No cutting of trees exceeding six inches in diameter (measured at a
height of four feet off the ground) except in accordance with an
approved building permit, site plan, subdivision or timberharvesting
plan. Cutting of all trees in a single contiguous area
exceeding 5,000 square feet shall be prohibited.
(7) Throughout the Suffern Scenic Overlay District,
telecommunications towers shall be discouraged. In all cases, the
Village shall encourage shared use of towers rather than new
construction and reduced tower height to limit the need for
external lighting.

objectionable to nearby properties by reason of noise, traffic, fumes,
vibration or other characteristics than would be the operations of
permitted uses not requiring a special permit.
D. Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular special permit
use, properly located and suitably screened from adjoining residential
uses, and the entrance and exit drives shall be laid out so as to achieve
maximum convenience and safety.

1:572
(10) In determining whether to grant a special permit use for a hospital
heliport, the Board of Trustees may consider whatever additional
facts or consideration which it, in its sole discretion, deems to be
appropriate to protect and promote the interests of the residents of
the Village of Suffern and to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare.
(11) A special permit for a hospital heliport may be limited in duration.
A special permit to operate a heliport may be revoked by the Board
of Trustees upon notice for violation of this provision, the terms and
conditions of a special permit or site plan approval or if the use of
the same produces loud or disturbing noises or other disturbing
effects. If Board of Trustees deems it to be desirable to review the
terms, conditions or restrictions upon which a special permit has
been granted, it may do so upon due notice to the holder of a
special permit and the public.
W. Medical office building. [Added 2-12-2004 by L.L. No. 4-2004]
(1) A medical office building shall only be permitted where it is
associated with a public or private hospital. Except as noted below,
the medical office building shall be required to meet all special use
requirements set forth in § 266-33P, which regulates public and
private hospitals.
(2) All bulk requirements of § 266-23 of this Zoning Law shall be met,
except that the maximum permitted height of a medical office
building shall be a maximum of four stories and no higher than 55

hospital and medical office building shall be 60%. Off-street
parking and loading requirements shall be the same as those in
§ 266-22 for professional offices in the PO-40 District.
(3) Where a medical office building is proposed adjacent to a hospital
building, the Planning Board may provide for a waiver from the
requirements of § 266-15A relative to the minimum distance
between two buildings. In providing such waiver, the Planning
Board shall consider the extent to which separation between the
buildings is necessary to ensure access for public safety purposes.
(4) Where the Planning Board finds that the buffer requirements of this
section are sufficient to protect adjoining residential properties,
the Board may waive the requirement for a side yard for parking
areas and driveways.

parking and loading spaces to meet the needs of employees,
residents, visitors, clients, patrons and other persons at such structures or
uses, but not less than the minimum requirements of this Zoning Law. No
certificate of occupancy or certificate of use shall be issued until such offstreet
parking and loading spaces have been established or provided for in
accordance with the requirements of this Zoning Law.
§ 266-35. Location and access.
A. Required off-street parking spaces shall be provided on the same lot
with the structure or use they serve, except as provided § 266-36 of this
Zoning Law, and may be located within a building or in a side or rear
yard. Double-loaded spaces or stack parking shall not be permitted as a
means of satisfying the parking requirements. No off-street parking
spaces shall be located in a required front yard. In no event shall
parking and loading spaces for a use not permitted in a district be
located in that district. [Amended 6-15-1998 by L.L. No. 9-1998]
B. Unobstructed access to and from a street shall be provided for
nonresidential uses. Such access shall consist of at least one twelve-foot
lane for parking areas with 20 or fewer spaces and at least two twelvefoot
lanes for parking areas with over 20 spaces. Access to roads shall
include an adequate turnaround area to preclude the need for backing
out onto the road right-of-way. To the greatest extent practicable,
residential uses proposed along state roads shall be designed so as to
provide an adequate turnaround area and to preclude the need to back
out onto the road right-of-way.
C. No entrance or exit for any accessory off-street parking area with more
than four parking spaces or for any loading berth shall be located closer
than 75 feet from the intersection of any two designated street lines as
determined by the Official Map. This distance shall be 100 feet for any
signalized intersection or an intersection providing for a designated
left-turn storage lane on the same intersection leg as the proposed
access drive.
D. Off-street loading spaces may be located within any building, within a
side or rear yard or within a required off-street parking area, provided
that such spaces do not block access to such parking area or any
parking space. Unobstructed access, at least 12 feet wide, to and from a
street shall be provided to off-street loading berths. Such access may be
combined with access to parking areas. No off-street loading berth shall
be located between the street line and principal building. A loading
berth shall not be located in any required yard and shall be screened
where visible from any residential boundary.

2-5-2018 by L.L. No. 1-2018]
§ 266-37. Paving of nonresidential parking areas and driveways.
A. The total capacity of the common facility shall be the sum of the
requirements of each individual use, except that said total capacity may
be reduced by the Planning Board, provided that the applicant
demonstrates to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that the capacity
of such facility will meet the intent of the requirements by reason of the
provision of nonreserved parking spaces and variation in the probable
time of maximum use by residents, visitors, patrons and employees
among such uses.
B. As a condition of the approval of the joint use, the Planning Board shall
require a legal instrument satisfactory to the Planning Board and
Village Attorney assuring the continued existence and use of said
parking spaces in connection with the uses and structures that they
serve. Such instrument shall also guarantee that, upon termination of
such use, each individual participant will provide off-street parking and
loading spaces for its own use in accordance with all requirements of
this Zoning Law. Such instrument shall be recorded in the office of the
County Clerk of Rockland County.
A. Only one commercial vehicle not exceeding 22 feet in length, or eight
feet in height or seven feet in width, including all accessories and
equipment, may be parked on an occupied lot in any residential district.
Said vehicle may only be parked beyond the front line of the house on a
permitted driveway or parking area constructed and installed in
compliance with applicable laws, or within a private garage.
B. For purposes of this section, "commercial vehicle" shall mean any motor
vehicle used for commercial purposes, including but not limited to a
vehicle used for the transportation of goods, wares and merchandise, or
passengers for hire, or used for repair, service, installation, inspection,
landscaping or snowplowing purposes.
A. The paving of nonresidential parking areas and driveways shall require
site plan approval by the Planning Board. Prior to rendering a decision,
the Planning Board shall refer the site plan to the Superintendent of
Public Works for review and comment. The site plan shall include
specifications for the hardtop surface, subgrade, drainage and
landscaping, if required. The applicant must demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board that the base shall be properly

minor paving projects upon a finding that the paving will not have a
detrimental effect on the property or its surroundings.
A. Except for the following uses, no offstreet parking is required in the CB
District, unless a significant change in the characteristics of the use is
proposed, including but not limited to an increase in square footage of
the use of 50% or more; changes that would increase the number of
patrons or customers by more than 50%; redevelopment or
consolidation of lots with increased usage; any combination of the
foregoing; or new construction, in which case the Planning Board will
determine the appropriate required parking.

§ 266-38.1. Parking requirements in TDD District. [Added
5-18-2015 by L.L. No. 6-2015]
B. Fee in lieu. In the CB District, when any change or increase in the
intensity of use or any increase in the amount of gross floor area would
require the provision of additional off-street parking spaces in
accordance with the standards set forth in this section, the applicant for
such change or addition may request permission to make a cash
payment to the Village of Suffern Parking Improvement Fund in lieu of
providing some or all of such parking. The Board of Trustees, in its
discretion, may elect to accept such payment on behalf of the Village.
The amount of the cash payment per parking space required in such
cases shall be established, and may from time to time be amended, by
the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees shall submit any
application for a cash payment to the Planning Board for its review and
recommendation.
C. Dedication of land for parking purposes. When, in the CB District, any
change or increase in the intensity of use or any increase in the amount
of gross floor area would require the provision of additional off-street
parking spaces in accordance with the standards set forth in this
section, such standards may be waived or modified by the Planning
Board if the applicant conveys a permanent easement or dedication in
fee for the parking area shown on the adopted Parking Area Map. The
Planning Board may approve and the Board of Trustees may accept a
combination of an easement and a dedication in appropriate
circumstances.
D. Waiver of parking requirements. Upon consideration of the limited
nature of any particular application for increased intensity of use or
expansion, as well as the proximity of existing parking spaces, the
Planning Board may waive some or all of the off-street parking
requirements as set forth in § 266-41 of this chapter.
E. Appeals. The applicant may appeal the Planning Board's decision
regarding the dedication of land or parking requirements to the Board
of Trustees. In considering such an appeal, the Board of Trustees shall
review the Planning Board's recommendations.

§ 266-39. Existing structures and uses.
Structures and uses in existence or for which building permits have been
issued prior to the effective date of this Zoning Law shall not be subject
to the parking or loading requirements of this Zoning Law, provided that
any parking and loading facilities then existing to serve such structures
or uses shall not be reduced or redesignated to serve other structures or
uses, except to the extent they exceed such requirements. At the time of
any enlargement of such existing structures or uses, required parking and
loading facilities shall be provided as specified in this Zoning Law.
§ 266-40. Design standards.
The size, layout, access and landscaping of parking spaces and loading
spaces and the provision of handicapped parking spaces shall be as
required in the Site Plan Regulations of the Village of Suffern.165
§ 266-41. Parking and loading requirements.
The Schedule of General Use Requirements166 presents the minimum
parking space and loading space requirements of this Zoning Law. Where
a lot contains more than one use, the minimum requirements must be
satisfied for each and every such use. For uses that do not fall within the
categories listed or for which no requirement is listed, the Planning Board
shall set the minimum parking space and loading space requirements,
based on the specific nature of the facility and on expected parking demand.

be established, operated and maintained in conformance with § 6-c of
the General Municipal Law. The Fund shall be initially established with
an appropriation of $2,000, which is hereby transferred from the
unallocated surplus to create the Fund. Upon the effective date of this

Zoning Law, the Village Treasurer shall effect such transfer and thereby
create such Fund without further action of the Village Board.
B. The Fund shall be preserved, invested and reinvested in the same
manner as other Village liquid assets. There shall be no upper limit or
critical amount beyond which the Fund can grow. The money in the
Fund shall be listed as a Village asset but may not be counted as Village
surplus for Village budget purposes. Neither shall the Fund be counted
as an asset in any analysis of Village solvency or for rating purposes,
and its deposits shall not be available to secure Village obligations other
than obligations undertaken in pursuit of the purposes of the Fund.
C. The expenditure of the Fund assets shall be limited exclusively to
capital projects designed to permanently increase the supply of public
parking spaces available to serve properties within the district. Nothing
herein shall be interpreted to mandate that a parking facility must be
constructed within the limits of the CB District.
D. For so long as there shall be a Village of Suffern Parking Authority, no
expenditures from the Fund shall be made by the Village Board, except
by joint agreement of the Village Board and the Board of the Parking
Authority.
E. Projects for the use of the assets of the Fund may be initiated by the
Planning Board of the Village and be proposed to the Village Board, by
the Village Board on its own initiative or by the Parking Authority of the
Village of Suffern. The creation, enlargement, alteration or
rehabilitation of parking facilities, whether privately or publicly
sponsored, shall be subject to site plan review and approval by the
Planning Board. The Village Board shall have the authority to transfer
Fund assets to the credit of the Parking Authority for use on projects of
which the Village Board approves.
F. No use of the assets of the Fund and no withdrawals or assignments
from the Fund shall be effected directly or indirectly, unless there shall
have been a properly advertised public hearing conducted by the
Village Board setting forth in reasonable detail the purposes therefor.
G. The amount to be collected per parking space pursuant to § 266-38A
hereof shall be an amount which shall be specified in the Village of
Suffern Fee Schedule resolution as adopted and amended from time to
time.167

equipment, personnel or placement of materials which may hazard a
public street, way, easement or public property, prior to issuing such
building permit, the applicant shall present evidence of liability
insurance naming the Village as the insured and saving the Village
harmless, in an amount to be set on an individual basis by the Building

1:585
Inspector and dependent on the degree to which the proposed activity
may create a hazard, in a form acceptable to the Village Attorney.
Additionally, property damage insurance or other surety acceptable
to the Village Attorney may be required where such construction or
activity may damage public property, including sidewalks, paving, signs
or landscaping. In reviewing any application hereunder, the Building
Inspector shall determine whether such hazard may exist by virtue of
the nature of activity described in such application. Where, after a
building permit has been issued without such liability insurance, it shall
appear that such hazards are present, the Building Inspector may, on
due notice given, require such insurance and may suspend such activity
pending receipt of the required liability policy.
G. Fees. Every application for a building permit pursuant to this Zoning
Law and/or the Building Code shall be accompanied by a fee in
accordance with the Fee Schedule of the Village of Suffern.169
(1) Upon application by a property owner, the Board of Trustees may
refund a portion of a building permit fee paid if the Building
Department was not required to undertake substantial work or
inspections with respect to the work or construction for which the
permit was issued. In making a determination as to whether to
make such a partial refund and the amount thereof, the Board of
Trustees shall consider:
(a) The amount of work or inspection required to be made by the
Building Department;
(b) Whether all or substantially all of the work was inspected and
certified by a professional engineer or other professional
approved by and acceptable to the Building Inspector, thereby
eliminating the necessity of inspections by the Building
Department;
(c) Whether the fee charged in accordance with the Standard
Schedule of Fees in the particular instance is grossly and
severely unfair and inequitable under the circumstances;
(d) Whether the applicant has acted in good faith and equitably in
all matters relating to the application for a building permit,
construction and compliance with applicable laws, rules and
regulations;
(e) Whether it is in the best interests of the Village of Suffern to
refund a portion of the building permit fee paid.
(2) An application for such a refund shall be filed with the Village Clerk
within 60 days after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy and
shall set forth the basis for the request for a refund. No application

§ 266-48. Certificates of occupancy and/or use.
No building or structure for which a building permit has been issued shall
be occupied or used in whole or in part until a certificate of occupancy and/
or certificate of use shall have been issued by the Building Inspector. No
certificate of occupancy or certificate of use shall be issued until such offstreet
parking and loading spaces have been provided for in accordance
with the requirements of Article VII of this Zoning Law.

the property. The Village Clerk shall transmit such application
to the Building Inspector for his review and recommendations.
The Building Inspector shall render a recommendation on the
application to the Board of Trustees within 60 days after referral
to him and shall refer to the foregoing considerations therein and
provide to the Board of Trustees whatever documentation and
records as are relevant in considering the matter. Thereafter, the
Board of Trustees shall determine, based on the foregoing
considerations, whether to provide a refund and the amount
thereof. No refund of a building permit fee shall be made unless
it is determined, as a consequence of the facts and circumstances,
the building fee charged is grossly excessive and that no
substantial inspection or similar work was required to be
undertaken by the Building Department.

D. A certificate of use shall be required for an existing structure where an
individual or multiple tenants occupy a building and a change of use, as
defined in this Zoning Law, is proposed. A change of use of a building,
structure or lot is interpreted for purposes of this Zoning Law as:
(1) A change that results in a difference in the numerical listing or the
use column (permitted, accessory or special permit) for a use as
specified in § 266-22, Schedule of General Use Requirements.171

plans shall be signed and certified by a New York State registered
architect or licensed professional engineer.
(2) An affidavit of the registered architect or licensed professional
engineer who supervised the construction of the work. This
affidavit shall state that the deponent has examined the approved
plans of the structure for which a certificate of occupancy is
sought, that the structure has been erected in accordance with the
approved plans and, as erected, complies with this Zoning Law and
the law governing building construction, including all subdivision
regulations and the requirements of any approved subdivision plat
or site plan, except insofar as variations therefrom have been
legally authorized. Such variations shall be specified in the
affidavit.
B. Issuance of certificate. Before issuing a certificate of occupancy, the
Building Inspector shall examine or cause to be examined all buildings,
structures and lots for which an application has been filed. There shall

violations of the law.
C. Fees. Every application for a certificate of occupancy shall be
accompanied by a fee as set forth in the Fee Schedule of the Village of

D. Termination. A certificate of occupancy shall be deemed to authorize
and is required for both initial and continued occupancy of the building
or land to which it applies and shall continue in effect so long as such
building or land is used for the use authorized in the certificate. If the
terms of such certificate are violated by the holder thereof, the Building
Inspector or Code Enforcement Officer may, by service of notice of
violation, revoke such certificate, which order of revocation is, however,
subject to review by the Board of Appeals by the holder thereof taking

of termination.
E. Copies. Copies of every certificate of occupancy issued hereafter shall
be furnished to the Planning Board or Board of Appeals for those
applications they approve and, on the payment of the regular
application fee therefor, to any other person. The fees required from the
general public for copies of public documents shall be in accordance
with the Fee Schedule of the Village of Suffern.173
F. Temporary certificate of occupancy. Upon request, the Building
Inspector may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a period
not to exceed 90 days prior to the completion of any required
landscaping, concrete work or other improvements which may not be
installed due to seasonal constraints, provided that such portion or
portions as have been completed may be occupied safely without
endangering life or the public welfare. The Building Inspector shall
require surety from the owner or holder of the building permit, which
surety shall run to the benefit of the Village for a term not exceeding 90
days. The amount of said surety shall be sufficient to cover the cost to
complete the work and shall be set and held by the Village Board of
Trustees, upon the advice of the Building Inspector and the Department
of Public Works, with the approval of the Planning Board, and in such
form acceptable to the Village Attorney. Every application for a
temporary certificate of occupancy shall be accompanied by a fee in

Inspector shall examine or cause to be examined all buildings,
structures and sites for which an application has been filed for a
building permit to construct, enlarge, alter, repair, remove, demolish or
change the use; and he will conduct such inspections during and upon
completion of the work for which a building permit has been issued.
There shall be maintained by the Building Inspector a record of all such
examinations and inspections, together with a record of findings of
violations of the law. However, any certificate of use for the
establishment of any use of a building or land requiring a special permit
as listed in the Schedule of General Use Regulations,174 and any other
particular use requiring the approval of the Planning Board, shall be
issued only with the authorization of the Planning Board. Every
certificate of use for which a special permit or variance has been

variance and of the conditions to which the same is subject.
C. Fees. Every application for a certificate of use shall be accompanied by
a fee as set forth in the Fee Schedule of the Village of Suffern.175
D. Termination. A certificate of use shall be deemed to authorize and is
required for both initial and continued use of the building or lot to
which it applies and shall continue in effect so long as such building or
land is used for the use authorized in the certificate of use. If the terms
of such certificate of use are violated by the holder thereof, the Building
Inspector may, by service of notice of violation, terminate such
certificate of use, which order of termination is, however, subject to
review by the Board of Appeals by the holder thereof taking an appeal
to the Board of Appeals within 30 days of service of said order of
termination.
E. Copies. Copies of every certificate of use issued hereafter shall be

F. Temporary certificate of use. The Building Inspector may issue a
temporary certificate of use only when a temporary certificate of
occupancy has been approved in accordance with § 266-49F. The
certificate of use may be granted at any time during the ninety-day
period that the certificate of occupancy is in effect and shall expire at
the terminal date of the temporary certificate of occupancy. Every
application for a temporary certificate of use shall be accompanied by a
fee in accordance with the Fee Schedule of the Village of Suffern.
A. Penalties. Any person who shall violate any provision of this Zoning Law
or any other regulation made under authority conferred thereby, or who
shall build or alter any structure or use any land in violation of any
statement or plan submitted and approved thereunder, or who shall
knowingly assist therein, shall be liable to a fine of not more than
$5,000, or to community service in an amount deemed appropriate to
the court, or to imprisonment for a period not exceeding 10 days, or any
combination of the same. Each week's continued violation shall
constitute a separate and additional violation. In addition to the
foregoing provisions, the Village shall have such other remedies for any
violation or threatened violation of this Zoning Law as are now or may
hereafter be provided by law. The application of any above penalty shall
not be held to prevent any action under § 266-51B of this Zoning Law.

constructed, altered or maintained in violation of this Zoning Law, any
regulation made pursuant thereto or any detailed statement or plan
submitted and approved thereunder, in addition to other lawful
remedies, any appropriate action or proceedings may be instituted to
prevent such unlawful use, erection, construction, alteration or
maintenance, to restrain, correct or abate such violation, to prevent the
occupancy or use of such structure or land or to prevent any illegal act,
conduct, business or use in or about such premises. Whenever the
Building Inspector has reasonable grounds to believe that work on any
building, structure or lot is being performed in violation of the
provisions of this Zoning Law or not in conformity with any regulation
made pursuant thereto or not in compliance with any detailed
statement or plan submitted and approved thereunder or in an unsafe
and dangerous manner, he may issue a stop-work order pursuant to the
provisions of this Zoning Law.
C. Noncompliance with orders. Any person who shall violate any order of
the Building Inspector or Code Enforcement Officer, issued under this
Zoning Law shall be deemed to have violated this Zoning Law. Any
person failing to comply with an order within the time stated therein
shall be deemed guilty and fined. Each week of continuance of a
violation shall constitute a separate and distinct offense hereunder.

Board of Appeals
§ 266-52. Organization.
The Board of Appeals, containing five members, as heretofore established

The Mayor, subject to confirmation by the Board of Trustees, may appoint
two alternate members to the Zoning Board of Appeals to serve as provided
for in this section. Such alternate members shall be appointed for a twoyear
term of office. The Chairman of the Zoning Board of Appeals shall
assign such alternate member(s) as necessary when the absence of regular
members of said Board or the conflict of interest of regular members
of said Board would otherwise prevent five members of said Board from
considering any pending matter. Once designated to serve on a particular
matter before the Board, the alternate member(s) shall have the same
powers and duties as regular members of the Board until the matter is
concluded. Any determination of said Board consisting of an alternate
member shall have the same weight and be entitled to the same authority
as the act or deed of the regular Zoning Board of Appeals, and all laws,
statutes and regulations shall apply and be applied with equal force and
effect. Such alternate members appointed pursuant to this section shall be
paid for his or her respective services as fixed by resolution of the Board of
Trustees.
§ 266-53. Meetings and records.
Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairman and at such other times
as the Board of Appeals may determine. The Chairman may appoint a Vice
Chairman. The Board of Appeals may adopt rules and regulations governing
its procedures. The presence of three members of the Board of Appeals shall
be necessary for a quorum. The concurring vote of three members shall be
necessary to grant any variance of this Zoning Law, to reverse any order,
requirement, decision or determination appealed from or to decide in favor
of the applicant any matter before the Board of Appeals. The Board shall
keep minutes of its proceedings, showing the vote of each member on every
question or, if any member is absent or fails to vote, indicating that fact,
and shall also keep records of its examinations and other official actions.
Every rule, determination, regulation, amendment or appeal thereof and
every order, requirement and decision of the Board of Appeals shall be filed
in the office of the Village Clerk.
§ 266-52 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-54
1:593
§ 266-54. Powers and duties.
A. General. The Board of Appeals shall have all of the powers and duties
prescribed by the Village Law and by this Zoning Law, which powers
and duties are summarized and more particularly specified in the
following, provided that none of the following sections shall be deemed
to limit any of the powers of the Board of Appeals that are conferred by
the Village Law. In passing upon any matter before it, the Board of
Appeals shall take into specific consideration the goals of this Zoning
Law and the recommendations of the Village Comprehensive Plan.
B. Rules and regulations. The Board of Appeals may adopt such rules and
regulations as are necessary or proper to the performance of its powers
and duties hereunder and may amend or repeal the same.
C. Nonconforming uses. The Board of Appeals is authorized to extend the
permitted period for cessation of a nonconforming use in accordance
with the requirements of § 266-14B(5) of this Zoning Law; to review and
approve, approve with modifications or disapprove a plan for
reconstruction of a nonconforming building in accordance with the
requirements of § 266-14D(2) of this Zoning Law; to permit the change
of a nonconforming use to another nonconforming use in accordance
with § 266-14E of this Zoning Law; and to review and approve, approve
with modifications or disapprove a plan for the improvement of a
nonconforming use in accordance with § 266-14F of this Zoning Law.
D. Variances.
(1) On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or determination
made by an administrative official charged with the enforcement of
this Zoning Law or on referral of an applicant to the Board of
Appeals by an approving agency acting pursuant to this Zoning
Law, the Board of Appeals is authorized to vary or modify the strict
letter of this Zoning Law where its literal interpretation would
cause practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships in such
manner as to observe the spirit of the law, secure public safety and
welfare and do substantial justice.
(2) In adopting the provision of § 266-54D(3) which provides that the
Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant use variances
authorizing the use of land which would otherwise not be allowed
or would be prohibited by the terms of this Zoning Law except for
any prohibited use listed in § 266-14I, the Board of Trustees hereby
exercises its authority pursuant to §§ 10(1)(ii)(e), to amend the
application of the provisions of § 7-712-b, Subdivision 2, of the
Village Law to it in providing that the Zoning Board of Appeals does
not have the jurisdiction or authority to grant a use variance to
permit a use specifically prohibited by § 266-14I of this Zoning Law.
(3) Use variances.
§ 266-54 SUFFERN CODE § 266-54
1:594
(a) The Board of Appeals shall have the power to grant use
variances authorizing the use of land which would otherwise
not be allowed or would be prohibited by the terms of this
Zoning Law except for any prohibited use listed in § 266-14I.
No such use variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary
hardship. In order to prove unnecessary hardship, the
applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of Appeals that:
[1] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided
that the lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by
competent financial evidence. [Amended 9-25-1996 by
L.L. No. 6-1996]
[2] The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood in which it is located.
[3] The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood.
[4] The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(b) The Board of Appeals, in granting of such use variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proved by the
applicant and, at the same time, preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
(4) Area variances.
(a) Where, because of practical difficulty, an applicant requests a
variance of the lot area or other bulk requirements of this
Zoning Law, the Board of Appeals may grant a variance in the
application of the provisions of this Zoning Law in the specific
case, provided that as a condition to the grant of any such
variance, the Board of Appeals shall make a specific finding
that the application of the requirements of this Zoning Law to
the land in question creates such practical difficulty. In making
this determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into
consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety
and public welfare of the neighborhood or community by such
grant. In making such determination, the Board of Appeals
shall consider:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by the granting of the area
variance.
§ 266-54 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-54
1:595
§ 266-55. Procedure.
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method, feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance.
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial.
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district.
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting
of such variance.
(b) The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall
grant the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.
E. Interpretations. On appeal from an order, requirement, decision or
determination made by an administrative official charged with the
enforcement of this Zoning Law or on request from any official, agency
or Board of the Village, the Board of Appeals is authorized to decide any
question involving the interpretation of any provision of this Zoning
Law. Interpretations shall be made in accordance with the intent of the
particular provision being interpreted.
F. Conditions and safeguards. The Board of Appeals may prescribe such
conditions or restrictions applying to the grant of a variance as it may
deem necessary in each specific case, in order to minimize the adverse
effects of such variance upon other property in the neighborhood and to
protect the public health, safety and welfare. Such conditions or
restrictions shall be incorporated in the site or subdivision plan,
building permit, certificate of occupancy and certificate of use. Failure
to comply with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a
violation of this Zoning Law and may constitute the basis for denial or
revocation of a building permit, certificate of occupancy or certificate of
use and for all other applicable remedies. Where required, the Zoning
Board of Appeals may set a terminal date for such variance.
A. Appeal or application. An appeal shall be taken within 60 days of the
order or decision appealed from. A notice of appeal shall be filed with
the official or agency from whom the appeal is taken and with the Board
of Appeals and shall specify the grounds therefor. The official or agency
from whom the appeal is taken shall forthwith transmit to the Board of
Appeals all the papers constituting the record upon which the action
appealed from is taken. A referral to the Board of Appeals for a variance
§ 266-54 SUFFERN CODE § 266-55
1:596
or a request for an interpretation may be made at any time. All such
appeals and applications to the Board of Appeals shall be made by
the owner or agent duly authorized, in writing, and shall be on forms
prescribed by the Board of Appeals. Each appeal or application shall
fully set forth the circumstances of the case, shall refer to the specific
provision of the Zoning Law involved and shall exactly set forth, as
the case may be, the interpretation that is claimed, the details of the
adjustment that is applied for and the grounds for which it is claimed
that the same should be granted.
B. Review by other agencies.
(1) Upon receipt of a completed appeal or application, the Board of
Appeals shall forward copies for review and report to such officials
and agencies of the Village as it deems appropriate. All such
agencies shall have 30 days from the date of forwarding to submit a
report. The Board of Appeals shall not decide on the matter until it
has received the report of the agency or 30 days have passed since
such forwarding.
(2) The Board of Appeals shall refer to the Rockland County
Commissioner of Planning for its recommendation all matters
within the provisions of §§ 239-l and 239-m of the General
Municipal Law which includes real property lying within 500 feet
from the boundary of any City, Village or Town; or from the
boundary of any existing or proposed County or state park or other
recreation area; or from the right-of-way of any existing or
proposed County or state parkway, thruway, expressway, road or
highway; or from the existing or proposed right-of-way of any
stream or drainage channel owned by the County or for which the
County has established channel lines; or from the existing or
proposed boundary of any County or state owned land on which a
public building or institution is situated. The Rockland County
Commissioner of Planning shall render a decision within 30 days of
referral or within an extended period if agreed upon. If the
Rockland County Commissioner of Planning fails to report within
such period of 30 days or such longer period as has been agreed
upon, the Board of Appeals may act without such report. If the
Rockland County Commissioner of Planning disapproves the
proposal or recommends modifications thereof, the Board of
Appeals shall not act contrary to such disapproval or
recommendation except by a vote of a majority plus one of all
members thereof and after the adoption of a resolution fully setting
forth the reasons for such contrary action. Within seven days after
adoption of the minutes regarding such action by the Board of
Appeals, a report shall be filed with the Rockland County
Commissioner of Planning.
C. Public hearing. The Board of Appeals shall conduct a public hearing on
any appeal, application or request made pursuant to this Zoning Law.
§ 266-55 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-55
1:597

least 10 days prior to the date of such hearing. Notice shall also be
sent 10 days prior to the date of such hearing to all property
owners within 500 feet of the perimeter of the property by regular
mail. The applicant shall cause signs to be posted on such property
on each street frontage indicating the date and purpose of such
hearing and in a manner prescribed by the Board of Appeals. The
costs of all such notices shall be paid by the applicant. [Amended
8-15-1994 by L.L. No. 9-1994]

by a full statement of the matter under consideration.
E. Action. Every decision of the Board of Appeals shall be by resolution,

findings and the conclusions on which the decision was based. The
Board of Appeals shall decide on matters before it within 62 days after
the close of the public hearing and, unless such time limit is extended
by mutual agreement with the applicant, shall file its resolution in the
offices of the Board of Appeals and the Village Clerk within five
business days after the date a decision is rendered and shall thereafter
mail a copy of such resolution to the applicant.
F. Compliance with SEQRA. The Board of Appeals shall comply with the
provisions of the State Environmental Quality Review Act176 and its
implementing regulations.
A. In adopting the provisions of this section, the Board of Trustees hereby
exercises its authority pursuant to §§ 10(1)(ii)(e), to amend the

substantial construction, in accordance with the plans for which such
variance was granted, has not been completed within one year or such

Site Plan Approval
§ 266-59. Authority. [Amended 9-25-1996 by L.L. No. 6-1996]
Pursuant to § 7-725-a of the Village Law, the Board of Trustees hereby
delegates final authority to the Planning Board for approval of any site plan
required by this Zoning Law.
§ 266-60. Site plan approval required.
A. Approval of a site plan by the Planning Board is required for the
development or redevelopment of any property or structure for a new
use, the expansion or relocation of any existing use or a change of use.
A change of use of a building, structure or lot is interpreted for
purposes of this Zoning Law as:
(1) A change that results in a difference in the numerical listing or the
use column (permitted, accessory or special permit) for a use as
specified in § 266-22, Schedule of General Use Requirements.178
(2) A change in the off-street parking standards for a use as specified
in § 266-22, Schedule of General Use Requirements.
(3) A change in a building's facade.
B. Exception for certain nonresidential uses proposed in the CB District.
[Added 3-13-2003 by L.L. No. 2-2003179]
(1) Purpose. The purpose of this section is to support the revitalization
of the Village's Central Business (CB) District by encouraging the
continued use and re-use of buildings that are in existence on the
effective date of this subsection. To achieve this objective, the
Village seeks to expedite the development review process by
eliminating site plan review and approval, or limiting the site plan
application submission and review, for certain nonresidential uses,
provided said uses meet the conditions set forth in Subsection B(2)
below.
(2) Site plan approval exception. Upon a determination made by the
Building Inspector, site plan review and approval shall not be
required for proposed nonresidential uses that meet the following
standards:
(a) The use shall be located in a building in existence on the
effective date of this subsection.
178. Editor's Note: The Schedule of General Use Requirements is located at the end of this
chapter.
179. Editor's Note: This local law also redesignated former Subsection B as Subsection C.
§ 266-59 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 266-60
1:601
(b) The use is permitted as-of-right within the CB District at the
time of application. Site plan review and approval shall be
required for special uses.
(c) The use shall occupy not more than 2,500 square feet of gross
floor area of the building in which it is to be located.
(d) The use shall not result in a required amount of parking that
exceeds the amount of parking required for the prior use.
(e) The use will not result in any exterior change to the building
facade, except for signage. The Planning Board shall review
and approve any sign for the proposed use.
(3) Limited site plan review. Where a proposed application meets the
requirements of § 260-60B(2)(a) through (d) but proposes a
physical alteration to the building's facade, the site plan application
shall be limited to submission of the standard site plan application
form and a building elevation(s), architectural rendering or other
scaled architectural drawing. The Planning Board's review and
approval shall be limited to a determination of the proposal's
conformity to Chapter 228, Article VI, Site Planning Design
Criteria, of the Village of Suffern Site Plan Regulations, and any
design guidelines applicable to the CB district which the Board of
Trustees may adopt from time to time.
(4) Building Inspector determination. The Building Inspector shall
provide, in writing, the reasons supporting the determination and
said determination shall be filed in the office of the Building
Department. A copy of the determination shall be provided to the
Board of Trustees and Planning Board. Any building permit
application that does not meet the conditions listed in § 266-60B(2)
above shall require site plan review and approval by the Planning
Board.
C. The Planning Board shall make the final determination as to whether or
not a change of use requires submission and approval of a site plan.
One-family and two-family dwellings do not require site plan approval
as required in this article. Where site plan approval is required,
applications for the issuance of a building permit, certificate of
occupancy or certificate of use must be accompanied by a copy of the
approved site plan bearing the signature of the Planning Board
Chairman. The continued validity of any certificate of occupancy or
certificate of use shall be subject to continued conformance with such
approved site plan and conditions. Site plans are continuing obligations
for the life of the use for which they are approved. Unapproved
deviations from or neglect in maintenance of an approved site plan are
violations of this Zoning Law and may be prosecuted in the same
manner as any other violation. Revisions made to approved site plans
shall be subject to the same approval procedure as the initial
application.

extension(s).

years from the date of filing, within which time building permits shall be
obtained in accordance with Zoning Ordinance provisions in effect at
the time of application of building permit.

approval has lapsed, it may be reinstated, in the Board's sole discretion,

review required. A new public hearing may be required.

§ 267-1. Legislative intent.
A. It is the intention of the Board of Trustees in adopting this chapter to
provide a mechanism whereby the Village of Suffern is reimbursed for
the reasonable and customary cost of reasonably required professional
review and consultation services in the review of zoning and planning
applications pending before the Planning Board, Zoning Board of
Appeals and Board of Trustees. It is also the intention of the Board of
Trustees to ensure that such fees charged to an applicant are
reasonable in terms of the nature of the review services, necessity for
such services, the hourly rate charged, the amount of time expended on
such review and the total sum charged for professional review on an
application.
B. It is further intended to assess applicants only for the reasonable fees
for the utilization of outside consultants or professionals. It is not the
intention of the Board of Trustees to charge applicants for the review or
consultation of employees of the Village of Suffern. In particular, this
chapter is not intended to charge applicants for the ordinary review and
services of the Village Attorney or Village Engineer (Superintendent of
Public Works). This chapter is intended to charge applicants for the
reasonable and necessary fees for planning consultants, outside
engineers and other technical professionals.
C. In order to be assured that the fees charged an applicant are
reasonable in terms of the hourly rate charged, the amount of time
expended on review and the total sum charged for professional review
on a particular type of application, the Board of Trustees has caused a
survey of fees charged by various consultants, professionals and
municipalities to be conducted.
D. Lastly, by establishing a mandatory escrow account and other
mechanisms to assure collection of such review fees, the Board of
Trustees intends to guarantee that each applicant pays the reasonable
and fair cost of professional review of an application and that the cost of
such professional review is not borne by the taxpayers of the Village of
Suffern.
E. In adopting this chapter, the Board of Trustees utilizes the authority of
§§ 10, Subdivision 1(i), 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(9-a) and (14), of the
§ 266-77 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 267-1
1:611
§ 267-2. Definitions.
The following terms shall have the meanings set forth below for purposes of
this chapter:
APPLICATIONS  An application for approval of a site plan, subdivision,
special permit, variance, zone change or amendment of the text of the
Zoning Law,184 interpretation of the Zoning Law or appeal of a decision or
determination of the Building Inspector or other administrative official.
BOARD  The Planning Board, Zoning Board of Appeals or Board of
Trustees of the Village of Suffern.
CHAIRMAN  The Mayor of the Village of Suffern with respect to
applications pending before the Board of Trustees, the Chairman of the
Zoning Board of Appeals with respect to applications pending before the
Zoning Board of Appeals or the Chairman of the Planning Board with
respect to applications pending before the Planning Board.
CONSULTANT  Planning consultant, engineer, environmental consultant
or professional in any other substantive technical area of knowledge or
expertise which is necessary to adequately review an application consistent
with the jurisdiction of a board.
§ 267-3. Consultant fees.
Municipal Home Rule Law to adopt this chapter. In addition, in order to
amend the application of §§ 4-412(1), 7-706, 7-712-a, 7-725-a, 7-725-b,
7-728 and 7-730 of the Village Law, the Board of Trustees hereby
utilizes the provisions of § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)d(3), of the Municipal
Home Rule Law to amend the application of said sections to it.
A. In performing the review of any application, the Board may determine
that it is necessary to refer said application to one or more consultants
in order to adequately review such application, any concerns or issues
relevant to said application or compliance with the applicable
provisions of the Zoning Law,185 Site Plan Regulations,186 Subdivision
Regulations,187 Village Law, New York State Uniform Fire Prevention
and Building Code, State Environmental Quality Review Act188 or any
other applicable statute, law, rule, regulation or code.
B. Should a Board determine that it is necessary to refer an application to
one or more consultants, as set forth in § 267-3A, the Board shall obtain
a written estimate from one or more consultants who practice in the
relevant area of expertise and, based upon the estimates provided and
consultation with Village staff, determine a reasonable estimate for the

§ 267-1 SUFFERN CODE § 267-3
1:612
reasonable cost of such review and consultation services for each
necessary area of professional services. In determining the reasonable
cost of such necessary review and consultation services, the Board, in
consultation with Village staff, shall determine that the fees charged by
the consultant to be retained for such service are customarily charged
for such services in Rockland County and that the fees to be charged by
such consultant(s) are competitive with the fees charged by comparable
professionals and consultants in Rockland County in terms of an hourly
rate charged and in the fee for review of the entire project. In arriving
at an estimate for review of an application, the Board, to the extent
practicable, shall render an estimate for review of all aspects of the
project, including all reasonably anticipated reviews from inception to
completion of review of the proposal.
C. The Village shall not be confined to retaining consultants doing
business in the Rockland County market and shall not be limited to
retaining consultants whose fees are commensurate with those set
forth in § 267-3B. However, an applicant is only responsible to
reimburse the Village at an hourly rate or on a fee basis commensurate
with those fees determined to be charged for commensurate services by
comparable professionals in Rockland County in accordance with
§ 267-3B herein.
D. Once the Board shall have determined an estimate for fees necessary
for review of a proposal consistent with the provisions of this chapter, it
shall notify the applicant of the amount of such estimate, together with
a detailed analysis of the basis for such estimate. An applicant shall pay
the amount of such estimate to the Village Treasurer prior to further
review of such proposal by the Board. The Village Treasurer shall notify
the Secretary to such Board that the required sum has been paid to the
Village immediately upon receipt of payment. Said sum shall be
deposited and segregated in one or more trust accounts and shall only
be drawn upon in accordance with the provisions of § 267-3E herein.
E. Upon presentment with bills from consultants retained in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter, the Village Treasurer shall forward a
copy of such bills or invoices to the Chairman of such Board, who shall
examine the same and certify that the services set forth therein were
necessary for adequate review of an application and that, based upon
studies or reports performed for the Village of Suffern, such fees are
customarily charged for such services in Rockland County and that the
fees to be charged by such consultant(s) are competitive with the fees
charged by comparable professionals and consultants in Rockland
County in terms of an hourly rate charged and in terms of the fee for
review of the entire project. Simultaneously therewith, the Village
Treasurer shall forward a copy of said bill or invoice to the applicant.
F. Upon receipt of certification from the Chairman of such Board, the
Village Treasurer shall make payment of said amount approved by such
Chairman to the consultant from the funds deposited in the
aforementioned trust account by the applicant.
§ 267-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 267-3
1:613
G. Once an application has been withdrawn, denied or approved, the
Chairman shall so notify all consultants retained in accordance with the
provisions of this chapter that no further review is required and that the
consultant(s) are required to provide to the Village Treasurer a final bill
within 15 days of the date of said letter. Upon receipt of said final bill(s)
or the passage of 15 days, the Village Treasurer shall make final
payment of all outstanding bills to such consultant(s) and shall refund
to the applicant the balance, if any, remaining in such trust fund(s) to
the credit of the applicant.
H. Upon exhaustion of the trust fund paid by an applicant in accordance
with § 267-3B, the Village Treasurer shall immediately so notify the
Chairman of such Board and all consultants retained in accordance with
this chapter in connection with an application that all such funds have
been expended. No further review of such application by consultant(s)
retained in accordance with this chapter shall transpire unless and until
the provisions of this section have been complied with. Once the funds
deposited in accordance with this chapter have been expended, the
Chairman of a Board, upon consultation with previously retained
consultants, Village staff and/or the applicant may certify in writing to
the applicant and Village Treasurer that additional review is required
by the same or additional consultants. Said certification shall,
additionally, set forth an estimate for such services in accordance with
and containing the particulars required by § 276-3B herein, together
with an explanation for the requirement for additional review. Upon
receipt of such certification, the applicant shall forthwith forward the
sum set forth therein to the Village Treasurer, who shall deposit said
sum in a trust account in accordance with the provisions of § 276-3D
and which sums shall be disbursed only in accordance with the
provisions of § 276-3E.
I. If an application requires approval or permits from more than one
Board of the Village of Suffern, the Chairmen of such boards may, in
conformity with the provisions of § 276-3A and B herein, determine an
appropriate sum for review of all applications or, in the alternative,
each Board may separately determine an appropriate review sum. If an
application requires approval from more than one Board, the balance of
funds remaining following approval by a Board shall be retained by the
Village until other reviewing boards determine if review by
consultant(s) is required and the estimated cost thereof in accordance
with § 276-3A and B herein. If such additional consultant fees are
required, the amount of such unexpected trust funds shall be applied
thereto.
J. Final approval of an application shall not be granted, nor shall any map,
plat, decision or local law be signed or released by the Secretary to a
Board, nor shall a building permit or certificate of occupancy be
granted until all fees for consultant services rendered in accordance
with the provisions of this chapter have been fully paid by an applicant.

§ 267-4. Limitations.
The provisions of this chapter are intended to supplement the provisions of
6 NYCRR 617.17, and the limitations therein are not construed to represent
a limitation on review fees set in accordance with this chapter which are not
for the preparation or review of environmental impact statements.
