ARTICLE I
Authority, Title and Purpose
§ 144-1. Authority.33
A local law of the Village of Johnson City, hereinafter referred to as "village,"
is hereby adopted pursuant to Article 8 of the New York Environmental
Conservation Law providing for environmental quality review of actions
which may have a significant effect upon the environment.
§ 144-2. Short title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Village of Johnson City
Environmental Quality Review Law."
§ 144-3. Purpose and intent.
A. The purpose of the Village Environmental Quality Review Law is to
incorporate the consideration of environmental factors into the
planning and decisionmaking processes of the village. In adopting the
Village Environmental Quality Review Law, it is the intent of the village
that all agencies operating within its jurisdiction conduct their affairs
with an awareness that they are the stewards of air, water, land and
living resources and that they have an obligation to protect the
environment for the use and enjoyment of this and all future
generations.
B. It is the intent of this chapter that the protection and enhancement of
the environment and human and community resources should be given
appropriate weight with social and economic considerations in public
policy and that those factors be considered together in reaching
decisions on proposed activities. It is the intention of the village that
through implementation of this chapter a suitable balance of social,
economic and environmental factors be incorporated into the
decisionmaking processes of the village. It is not the intention of the
Village Environmental Quality Review Law that environmental factors
be the sole consideration in decisionmaking.

ARTICLE XI
Type I and Type II Actions
§ 144-56. Type I actions.
A. Purpose; construal.
(1) The purpose of the list of actions identified as Type I in this section
is to identify for agencies, project sponsors and the public those
actions and projects that are more likely to require the preparation
of environmental impact statements (EIS's) than those not so listed
(i.e., "unlisted actions"). This Type I list is not exhaustive of those
actions that an agency may determine to have a significant effect
on the environment and to require the preparation of an EIS.
Therefore, the fact that an action or project has not been listed as a
Type I action does not carry with it the presumption that it will not
have a significant effect on the environment. For all individual
actions which are Type I or unlisted, the determination of
significance must be made by comparing the impacts which may be
reasonably expected to result from the proposed action with the
criteria listed in Part 617.11.
(2) The Type I actions on this list are considered more likely to require
the preparation of an EIS than other actions and are likely to
involve review by more than one (1) governmental agency, and
therefore, the procedural requirements for Type I actions are more
extensive than for those unlisted actions (Part 617.6).36
B. The following actions are Type I if they are directly undertaken, funded
or approved by an agency:
(1) The adoption of a municipality's land use plan or zoning regulations
or the adoption by any agency of a comprehensive resource
management plan.
(2) The following changes in the allowable uses within any zoning
district, affecting twenty-five (25) or more acres of the district:
(a) Authorizing industrial or commercial uses within a residential
or agricultural district; or
(b) Authorizing residential uses within an agricultural district.
(3) The granting of a zoning change at the request of an applicant for
an action that meets or exceeds one (1) or more of the thresholds
given in other sections of this list.
(4) The acquisition, sales, lease or other transfer of one hundred (100)
or more contiguous acres of land by a state or local agency.

any of the following thresholds or the expansion of existing
nonresidential facilities by more than fifty percent (50%) of any of
the following thresholds, provided that the expansion and the
existing facilities, when combined, meet or exceed any threshold
contained in this section:
(a) A project or action which involves the physical alteration of ten
(10) acres.
(b) A project or action which would use ground or surface water in
excess of two million (2,000,000) gallons per day.
(c) Parking for one thousand (1,000) vehicles.
(d) In a city, town or village having a population of one hundred
fifty thousand (150,000) persons or fewer: a facility with more
than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of gross floor
area.
(e) In a city, town or village having a population of more than one
hundred fifty thousand (150,000) persons: a facility with more
than two hundred forty thousand (240,000) square feet of
gross floor area.

any threshold in this section, occurring wholly or partially within or
substantially contiguous to any publicly owned or operated park
land, recreation area or designated open space.
(11) Any action which exceeds the locally established thresholds or, if
no such thresholds are established, any action which takes place
wholly or partially within or substantially contiguous to any critical
environmental area designated by a local agency pursuant to Part
617.4.
A. Actions or classes of actions which have been determined not to have a
significant effect on the environment are classified as Type II actions
and do not require environmental impact statements or any other
determination or procedure under this chapter.
B. Each agency may adopt its own Type II list, provided that it finds that
each of the actions contained on it:
(1) Is no less protective of the environment than the list in this section;
and
(2) Will in no case have a significant effect on the environment based
on the criteria contained in 617.11 and any additional criteria
contained in its procedures adopted pursuant to Part 617.4.
C. An agency may not designate as Type I any action on the Type II list.
D. The following actions are Type II actions:
(1) Replacement of a facility, in kind, on the same site unless such
facility meets any of the thresholds in Part 617.13.37

§ 156-1. Findings; purpose; objectives.
A. Findings. The Board of Trustees of the Village of Johnson City finds that
the potential and/or actual damages from flooding and erosion may be a
problem to the residents of the Village of Johnson City and that such
damages may include destruction or loss of private and public housing,
damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately owned, and
injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set
forth, this chapter is adopted.
B. Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and
private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property
due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of
initial construction.
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of floodwaters.
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase erosion or flood damages.
(5) Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other
lands.

154:170
§ 156-2. Definitions.
(6) Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood
Insurance Program.
C. Objectives. The objectives of this chapter are to:
(1) Protect human life and health.
(2) Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects.
(3) Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general
public.
(4) Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
(5) Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities, such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone, sewer lines, streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard.
(6) Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize
future flood blight areas.
(7) Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard.
(8) Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.

A. Lands to which this chapter applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas
of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of Johnson
City.
B. Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of
special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood
Insurance Study for the Village of Johnson City, of Broome County, New
York" (community number: 360047B), dated September 30, 1977, with
§ 156-2 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 156-3
154:174
accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps and Flood Boundary -
Floodway Maps (Map Panel H and 1-01), are hereby adopted and
declared to be part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and maps
are on file at the Planning Department in the Village offices.
C. Interpretation; conflict with other laws.
(1) This chapter is adopted in response to revisions to the National
Flood Insurance Program effective October 1, 1986, and shall
supersede all previous laws adopted for the purpose of establishing
and maintaining eligibility for flood insurance.
(2) In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this
chapter shall be held to be minimum requirements, adopted for the
promotion of the public health, safety and welfare. Whenever the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations or
ordinances are in conflict with the provisions of this chapter, the
most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards, shall
govern.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure shall hereafter be
constructed, located, extended, converted or substantially altered and
no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance with the
terms of this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this chapter by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be subject to the
penalties of § 156-7 of this chapter. Each day of noncompliance shall be
considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent
the Village of Johnson City from taking such other lawful action as
necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any structure found not
compliant with the requirements of this chapter for which the
developer and/or owner has not applied for and received an approved
variance under § 156-6 will be declared noncompliant and notification
sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
F. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not
imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Village
of Johnson City, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result from

automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
C. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard are areas
designated as floodways. (See definition in § 156-2.) The floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to high-velocity floodwaters carrying
debris and posing additional threats from potential erosion forces.
When floodway data is available for a particular site as provided by
§§ 156-3B and 156-4B(3)(b), all encroachments including fill, new
construction, substantial improvements and other developments are
prohibited within the limits of the floodway unless a technical
evaluation demonstrates that such encroachments shall not result in
any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood
discharge.
A. Appeals Board.
(1) The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Village of
Johnson City shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.

is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision or
determination made by the local administrator in the enforcement
or administration of this chapter.
(3) Those aggrieved by the decision of the Zoning Board of Appeals
may appeal such decision to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article
78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules.
§ 156-5 FLAMMABLE GASES, STORAGE OF § 156-6
154:183
(4) In passing upon such applications, the Zoning Board of Appeals
shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
(a) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
(b) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
(c) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.
(d) The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
(e) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
(f) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
(g) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
(h) The relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive
Plan and floodplain management program of that area.
(i) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
(j) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated
with conducting search and rescue operations during periods
of flooding.
(k) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave
action, if applicable, expected at the site.
(l) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical and water systems and streets and bridges.
(5) Upon consideration of the factors of § 156-6A(4) and the purposes
of this chapter, the Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal
actions, including technical information, and report any variances
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon request.

B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, provided that the
items in § 156-6A(4)(a) through (1) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical
justification required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or
restoration of structures and contributing structures listed on the
National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of
Historic Places, without regard to the contributing structures
procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.
(3) Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for
the conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(a) The criteria of Subsection B(1), (4), (5) and (6) of this section
are met.
(b) The structure or other development is protected by methods
that minimize flood damage during the base flood and create
no additional threat to public safety.
(4) Variances shall not be increased within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification

§ 163-1. Legislative findings and considerations.
The Village Board of the Village of Johnson City hereby finds and declares
that graffiti poses a serious problem for its residents and merchants. The
unabated proliferation of graffiti is a physical blight upon the landscape
of our Village and costs taxpayers, merchants and homeowners substantial
monies to remove and repair. The defacing of such property and the use of
foul language in many of the writings is harmful to the public and violates
the welfare and general good of the citizens and residents of the Village.
§ 163-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DEFACE  To mar, disfigure, injure, or otherwise spoil the face, surface, or
appearance of public or private property.
GRAFFITI  A writing, drawing, or mark etched, painted, placed or drawn
upon public or private property with the intent to deface said property.
§ 163-3. Prohibited acts.
No person shall place graffiti, or cause others to place graffiti, upon any
building or structure or any other real or personal property located in
the Village without the property owner's, or the owner's duly authorized
agent's, express written permission.
Friday and 2:00 a.m. Saturday and 12:00 noon on Saturday and 2:00
a.m. Sunday. The 2:00 a.m. closing period shall also apply to a legal
holiday. The above restrictions shall not apply when only the game of
chance known as the "bell jar" is conducted.
B. Games of chance may be commenced under any license issued pursuant
to this chapter on Sunday between the hours of 12:00 noon and 12:00
midnight only, except that the application for a license may request
approval to conduct such games of chance beyond 12:00 midnight if the
following day is a legal holiday. Notwithstanding the foregoing
provisions of this section, no games of chance shall be conducted on
Easter Sunday, Christmas Day or New Year's Eve.

The Village Board of the Village of Johnson City, or its enforcement office, is
hereby authorized in the name and on behalf of the Village to undertake and
prosecute any proceedings necessary or appropriate to enforce compliance
with this chapter.
A. Any person who violates § 163-3 of this chapter shall be punished by a
fine of not more than $1,000 and/or imprisonment for a term not to
exceed 15 days. Additionally, that person shall be liable for the cost of
repairing and/or removing the graffiti from the property and, in the
Court's discretion, may be ordered to perform appropriate community
services.
B. The parent or legal guardian of any minor over the age of 10 and under
the age of 18 who violates § 163-3 of this chapter shall be held liable for
any damages and/or cleanup costs that result from said violation.

provided in this chapter, the owner of record or his/her agent of any
premises located within the Village which has graffiti upon it without
the owner's written permission shall be required to repair, remove and/
or paint over the graffiti within 15 days after the Village has given the
owner or his agent written notice of the graffiti. Where the property in
question was previously painted, the same color paint shall be used on
the surface that has graffiti upon it.
B. Remedy by Village. If the owner of record or his/her agent does not cure
or correct the property's condition within 15 days after written notice
by the Village, then the Village shall have the right to enter the
premises to cure or correct the property's condition as set forth in this
section.
C. Cost. In the event that the Village cures or corrects the property's
condition as set forth in this section, the property's owner of record
shall bear the cost of the cure or correction. The Village will bill the cost
of such service, together with any other costs incidental to such cure or
correction, to said owner. Upon that property owner's failure to pay said
charge within 30 days of presentment, said charge shall thereupon
become a lien upon the property which the Village cured or corrected
and shall be added to and become a part of the taxes next to be
assessed and levied on such real property, and the same shall be
collected and enforced in the same manner as taxes.

Fire prevention  See Ch. 148.
Zoning  See Ch. 274.
§ 184-1. Purpose.
Although outdoor furnaces may provide an economical alternative to
conventional heating systems, concerns have been raised regarding the
safety and environmental impacts of these heating devices, particularly the
production of offensive odors and potential health effects of uncontrolled
emissions. It is generally recognized that the types of fuel used, and the
scale and duration of burning by outdoor woodburning furnaces, create
§ 176-7 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 184-1
180:252
noxious and hazardous smoke, soot, fumes, odors and air pollution, can be
detrimental to citizens' health, and can deprive neighboring residents of the
enjoyment of their property or premises. Therefore, with the adoption of
this chapter, it is the intention of the Village of Johnson City Village Board
of Trustees to establish and impose restrictions upon the construction and
operation of outdoor woodburning furnaces within the limits of the Village
for the purpose of securing and promoting the public health, comfort,
convenience, safety, and welfare of the Village and its inhabitants.
§ 184-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

The Village of Johnson City Code Enforcement Officer, or any other person
who may hereafter be designated by resolution of the Village Board, is
hereby authorized in the name and on behalf of the Village of Johnson City
to undertake and prosecute any proceedings necessary or appropriate to
enforce compliance with this chapter.
§ 184-5. Penalties for offenses.
A. Any person who shall violate any provision of this chapter shall be guilty
of a violation and shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not more
than $250 or to imprisonment for not more than 15 days, or both such
fine and imprisonment. Any subsequent offense shall be punishable by a
fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for a period of not more
than 30 days, or both. Each day that a violation occurs shall constitute a
separate offense. The owners of premises upon which prohibited acts
occur shall be jointly and severally liable for violations of this chapter.
B. Compliance with this chapter may also be compelled and violations
restrained by order or by injunction of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall also be
subject to a civil penalty of not more than $500, to be recovered by the

furnaces.
shall constitute a separate offense. The owners of premises upon which
prohibited acts occur shall be jointly and severally liable for violations
of this chapter.
C. In the event the Village is required to take legal action to enforce this
chapter, the violator will be responsible for any and all necessary costs
incurred by the Village of Johnson City relative thereto, including
attorney's fees, and such amount shall be determined and assessed by
the court. If such expense is not paid in full within 30 days from the date
it is determined and assessed by the court, such expense shall be
charged to the property so affected by including such expenses in the
next annual Village of Johnson City tax levy against the property. The
owners of premises upon which prohibited acts occur shall be jointly
and severally liable for violations of this chapter.
A. Except as hereinafter provided, the lawful use of any outdoor
woodburning furnace existing at the time of the adoption of this chapter
may be continued, although such use does not conform with the
provisions of this chapter.
B. No outdoor woodburning furnace existing at the time of the adoption of
this chapter shall thereafter be extended or enlarged.
C. Any existing outdoor woodburning furnace which is abandoned or
discontinued for a period of seven consecutive months shall not be
permitted to be reestablished as a nonconforming use, and must be
immediately removed by the property owner from the subject premises.

furnace by the end of said seven-consecutive-month period, the
Village of Johnson City Code Enforcement Officer shall give written
notice by certified mail or personal service to the owner of the
property upon which the outdoor woodburning furnace is located.

and Vendor Law."
B. The Board of Trustees, as a matter of legislative determination, does
hereby determine that the business, occupation or activity of transient

§ 196-2. Definitions.
As used in the chapter, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:
FARMERS MARKET  Any building or buildings, structure or structures or
premises used by four or more persons for the sale at retail of produce,
goods, wares or merchandise. The term "farmers market" shall be deemed
to not include "flea market" and similar terms.
PERSON  The singular and the plural, and shall also mean and include
any person, firm or corporation, association, club, partnership, society or
any other organization.
TRANSIENT RETAIL BUSINESS  A business conducted in a store, hotel,
motel, house, building, vehicle, structure or outdoor sale area located on
private property, and which is intended to be conducted for a temporary
period of time and not permanently. Pursuant to § 85-a of the General
Municipal Law, if the place in or from which a business is conducted is
rented, leased or occupied for a period of six months or less, such fact shall
be presumptive evidence that the business carried on therein is a transient
retail business.
VENDOR  A retailer of goods, or provider of services as a buyer or seller,
in the public streets and places and from door to door in the Village. The
term "vendor" shall include persons commonly referred to as "hawkers,"
"peddlers," "salespeople," or "canvassers." The term "vendor" shall not
include persons retailing goods or rendering services as a buyer or seller, if
such persons conduct their business in a store, hotel, motel, house, building,
vehicle, structure, or outdoor sale area located on private property.
§ 196-3. License not required.
retail businesses and vendors should be regulated as doing so is
necessary for the enforcement of law, the regulation of traffic, the
prevention of congestion of travel and for the protection and
preservation of the safety, health and general welfare and property of
the inhabitants of the Village and to protect such inhabitants against
the unlawful activities or operations of persons of criminal habits or
tendencies representing themselves as engaged in such business or
occupation, and that such persons shall be registered and required to
furnish such information as shall be necessary or desirable for purposes
of identification and to pay reasonable license fees and taxes.
Accordingly, the Village declares that the purpose of this chapter is to
establish, implement and enforce licensing procedures to be applicable
to all transient retail businesses and vendors within the Village of
Johnson City.
A. For all vendors selling goods in the farmers market located in the
Johnson City Senior Center located at 30 Brocton Street, Johnson City,

Purpose, Terminology and Presumptions
§ 206-1. Legislative findings and purpose.
The Village Board of Trustees of the Village of Johnson City finds that public
nuisances exist in the Village of Johnson City in the operation of certain
commercial establishments and in the use or alteration of residential and
commercial property in flagrant violation of the building code, zoning
regulations, health laws, penal laws regulating obscenity, prostitution and
related conduct, gambling, controlled substances and dangerous drugs,
possession of stolen property and of licensing laws. All of these interfere
with the interest of the public in property values, public health, safety and
welfare and the quality of life and the community environment. The Council
further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities and violations
is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the people of the Village
of Johnson City and of the businesses thereof and visitors thereto. It is
the purpose of the Board of Trustees to create one standardized procedure
for securing legal and equitable remedies relating to the subject matter
encompassed by this chapter, without prejudice to the use of procedures
available under existing and subsequently enacted laws, and to strengthen
existing laws on the subject.

authorizing agencies of the village to inspect the building, structure or
place which is the subject of an action pursuant to this chapter,

the court is satisfied that the public health, safety or welfare will be
protected adequately during the pendency of the action. The
undertaking shall be in an amount equal to the assessed valuation of the
building, structure or place where the public nuisance is being
conducted, maintained or permitted or in such other amount as may be

nuisance is being conducted, maintained or permitted that is not in the
ordinary course of the transferor's business.

be enforced by the Village Attorney, the Mayor or by the Village of
Johnson City Police Department.

complaint alleges that the nuisance is being conducted or maintained in
the residential portions of any building or structure, or a portion
thereof, which are occupied, in whole or in part, as the home, residence
or sleeping place of one or more human beings, the court may, upon
motion on notice by the plaintiff, appoint a temporary receiver to
manage and operate the property during the pendency of the action, in
lieu of a temporary closing order. A temporary receivership shall not
continue after final judgment unless otherwise directed by the court.

its own initiative, the appointing court may remove a temporary
receiver at any time.

of the temporary receiver, or of any person having an apparent interest
in the property, the court may require the keeping of particular records,
direct or limit inspection or require the presentation of a temporary
receiver's accounts. Notice of a motion for the presentation of a
temporary receiver's accounts shall be served upon the sureties on the

B. It is found and declared that by reason of lack of maintenance and
progressive deterioration certain structures and properties have the
future effect of creating blighting conditions and initiating slums, and
that if the same are not curtailed and removed, the aforesaid conditions
will grow and spread and will necessitate in time the expenditure of
large amounts of public funds to correct and eliminate the same. By
reason of timely regulations and restrictions as herein contained, the
growth of slums and blight may be prevented and the neighborhood and
property values thereby maintained, the desirability and amenities of
residential and nonresidential uses and neighborhoods enhanced and
the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

and garbage cans and containers shall be kept reasonably out of
view from the street or roadway and shall not be stored in the front
yard nor on the front porch of any building or structure.
(3) All landscaping shall be maintained so that the lawns, hedges,
bushes and trees shall be kept neat and free from becoming
overgrown and unsightly where exposed to public view and where
the same may constitute a blighting factor having a tendency to
depreciate adjoining property. Such maintenance shall include but
not be limited to the removal of trees and shrubs which may die and
or otherwise be destroyed.

property. Such maintenance shall include but not be limited to
painting, as needed, and the replacement, removal or repair of

shall be maintained so as to afford safe passage under normal use

deterioration shall be repaired or replaced and refinished in a
workmanlike manner.
C. Runoff. Surface and subsurface water shall be appropriately directed or
drained so as to have a minimum impact upon adjacent buildings and
properties and so as not to create ponding situations. This includes, but
is not limited to, not directing down spouts or leaders directly onto
adjoining property or into ditches.

extension of installation deadline.
A. Pursuant to Article 14-F, § 452, of the General Municipal Law, the
Village hereby establishes and imposes sewer rents in the Village for
the use of the sewer system or any part or parts thereof and establishes
and imposes such sewer rents as an annual charge on the real property
within the Village using such sewer system.
B. Such sewer rents shall be computed in the following manner: the first
1,000 cubic feet or less, minimum $50; all over 1,000 cubic feet, $5.25
per 100 cubic feet of water supplied; provided, however, that in the case
of consumers of water who discharge into the sewer system an amount
of sewage substantially less than or substantially greater than the
amount of water supplied to such consumer, the amounts of the sewage
discharged into the sewer system shall be determined by meters,
gauges or other suitable measuring devices acceptable to the Village
designee and installed by such consumer at the consumer's expense
and at no cost or expense to the Village of Johnson City, and the sewer
rent thereon shall be computed as follows: the first 1,000 cubic feet or
less, minimum $50; all over 1,000 cubic feet, $5.25 per 100 cubic feet of
sewage discharged into the sewer system. The Village designee may
require the owner of any real property in the Village to install a meter,
gauge or other suitable measuring device which is acceptable to the
Village designee and installed at the consumer's expense and at no cost
or expense to the Village of Johnson City; provided, however, that any
determination of the Village designee is subject to review and
modification by a court of competent jurisdiction. [Amended

to the Board of Trustees for its approval or modification, and the
decision of the Board of Trustees with respect thereto shall be binding
and final unless modified by a court of competent jurisdiction following
any review thereof permitted by law. Such owner shall thereupon, prior
to the aforementioned installation of a meter, gauge or other suitable
measuring device, pay sewer rents computed at the rate of the first
1,000 cubic feet or less, minimum $50; all over 1,000 cubic feet, $5.25
per 100 cubic feet of estimated sewage discharged into the sewer
system, and the decision of the Board of Trustees with respect to the
amount thereof shall be binding and final unless modified by a court of
competent jurisdiction following any review thereof permitted by law.
Such sewer rents computed at the rate of the first 1,000 cubic feet or
less, minimum $50; all over 1,000 cubic feet, $5.25 per 100 cubic feet of
estimated sewage discharged into the sewer system, shall be due and
payable at such time as the Board of Trustees shall fix and prescribe
therefore. In the case of real property in which water is used exclusively
for residential purposes, however, the owner of such real property shall,
prior to the installation of a meter, gauge or other suitable measuring
device, pay sewer rents in the amount of $200 per year for each
dwelling unit. [Amended 1-18-1971 by L.L. No. 1-1971; 5-5-1975

preventing the introduction of substances into the plant which impair
the strength and/or durability of the plant; which pass through the plant
inadequately treated; or which are otherwise incompatible with the
plant or the treatment processes utilized by the plant. It is the further
policy of the owners to protect the public health and the environment
by promoting the use and operation of the plant in a manner which
complies with the terms and conditions of the SPDES permit issued for
the plant by the DEC and in a manner which is consistent with the letter
and spirit of the industrial waste pretreatment program developed for
the plant and approved by the DEC and the EPA. It is the further policy
of the owners to foster the fiscal self-sufficiency of the sewage
treatment plant through the imposition of user charges which equitably
distribute the cost of operating and maintaining the plant among all
users in an economically sound manner.
B. The purpose of this Part 2 is to provide for the management, operation
and use of the joint sewage treatment plant and its appurtenant
structures and facilities so as to achieve maximum adherence to the

instance where they are more stringent than limitations in this Part 2. Users
in industrial categories subject to effluent guidelines issued under Section
304 of the Federal Act shall achieve the level of treatment established by
federal regulations. Nothing in this Part 2 shall be construed to relieve
any industrial user from its obligation to comply with the pretreatment
standards established pursuant to Section 307 of the Federal Act.
§ 222-40. Accidental discharge.
Each user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes regulated by this Part 2. Facilities to prevent
accidental discharge of prohibited materials shall be provided and
maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Board for review and shall be approved by the Board before construction
of the facility. Users shall give immediate notification to the Board upon
discharging wastes in violation of this Part 2 due to breakdown of
pretreatment equipment, accidents caused by human effort or negligence
or mechanical failure or other causes, such as acts of nature, to enable
countermeasures to be taken by the Board to minimize any resulting
interference or pass-through. In addition to the notice provided above,
§ 222-37 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 222-40
214:346
users shall notify the Board, in writing, within five (5) days of the date of
occurrence by a detailed statement describing the cause of the discharge
and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrences. Such
notification will not relieve users of liability for any expense, loss or damage
to the sewer system, treatment facility or treatment process or for any fines
imposed on the owners and/or the Joint Sewage Board on account thereof
under Section 309 of the Act or any liability for civil penalties assessed
against the user under § 222-54 of this Part 2.
§ 222-41. Confidential information.
Information and data concerning a user obtained from reports,
questionnaires, permit application, permits and monitoring programs and
from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental
agencies without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able
to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Board at the time the information
is submitted that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
of the user. When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions
of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall
not be made available for inspection by the public but shall be made
available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related
to these rules and regulations, the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination
System (NPDES) permit, the State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System
(SPDES) or any state agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Information accepted by the
Board as confidential shall not be transmitted to any governmental agency
or the general public by the Board until and unless a ten-day notification is
given to the user. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be
recognized as confidential information.
§ 222-42. Inspections.
A. The Joint Sewage Board, its authorized representatives and
representatives of the EPA and DEC, bearing proper credentials and
identification, shall be permitted to enter all properties at all

Industrial Wastewater Surcharge
§ 222-47. Imposition of surcharge.
In addition to any other fees, charges, sewer rents or sanitary district
taxes provided by law, the owner or tenant of any parcel of real property
connected with the sewer system by any means may be required to pay an
industrial wastewater surcharge for use of the wastewater treatment works
for discharging industrial wastes or other wastes accepted for admission
into the system other than normal sewage. The industrial wastewater
surcharge shall consist of but not be limited to the following charges:
§ 222-48. Basis for determination.
The industrial wastewater surcharge shall be based upon the measured or
estimated constituents and characteristics of the wastewater discharge of
the user, which may include but are not limited to flow rate, biochemical
oxygen demand (BOD5), total suspended solids (TSS), total phosphorous
(TP), total nitrogen (TKN) and total organic carbon (TOC). The wastewater
constituents and characteristics used to calculate the industrial waste
surcharge will be those determined by the Board. Any data provided by the
user may be used in addition to the data obtained by the Board.
§ 222-49. Computation of industrial wastewater surcharge.
A. Debt service charges.
B. Operation and maintenance charges.
A. The industrial wastewater surcharge shall be computed by the Manager
using the following surcharge formulas and shall apply to all industrial
users, as defined in § 222-10.
Surcharge = 8.34 Q (Cx - Cx STP) $x + ...
Where:
Q = Flow of user's discharge in millions of gallons per day.
Cx = Concentration of parameter x in user's discharge in
parts per million.
Cx STP = Sewage treatment plant design concentration of
parameter x in parts per million.
$x = Unit charge for treatment of parameter x in dollars per
pound.
B. The unit charge for treatment of any parameter subject to surcharge
will be based on the sum of charges attributable to the capital cost of
the treatment facilities and the operation and maintenance budget for
that given year. "Capital cost" is defined as the total annual debt service
cost for the sewage treatment plant. The "operation and maintenance

The pollutant concentration of any wastewater shall be determined from the
analysis of representative samples taken prior to discharge into the sewers,
taken by representatives of the Board at sampling stations as described in
§ 222-37 of this Part 2, at any period or time or of such duration and in
such a manner as the Board may elect or at any place or manner mutually
agreed upon between the user and the Board. The intent of any sampling
procedure is to establish the pollutant concentration in the wastewater
cost" is defined as the net annual cost of operating and maintaining the
sewage treatment plant after crediting all operating cost grants and
aid.
C. The unit charge for any parameter will include only that portion of the
capital and operation and maintenance costs which are directly
attributable to the treatment of that parameter. This unit charge will be
determined by the Board on an annual basis reflecting current debt
retirement and operation and maintenance costs.
D. The unit charge ($x) for any parameter (x) subject to surcharge will be
determined as follows:
$x = [Pcx (Capital Cost) + Pox (Operation and Maintenance
Cost)] ÷ 365 ÷ Lx
Where:
Pcx = Percentage of annual capital cost debt retirement
attributable to treatment of parameter x.
Pox = Percentage of annual operation and maintenance cost
attributable to treatment of parameter x.
Lx = Average sewage treatment plant influent loading of
parameter x in pounds per day.
A. The volume of wastewater discharged into the sewer system as
determined by the measurements and samples taken at a monitoring
facility installed by the owner of the property served by the sewer
system;
B. The amount of water supplied to the premises as shown on the water
meter, or water records if the premises are metered. Allowances for
water not discharged to the sewer system will be made at the discretion
of the Board; or
C. A figure determined by the Board by any combination of the foregoing
or by any other equitable method.

discharge during an average or typical working day. This concentration may
be derived according to the best judgment of the Board. The analysis of
samples taken shall be performed in a laboratory of the treatment plant or
a laboratory designated by the Board. The industrial waste surcharge and/
or the acceptability of the wastes shall be determined from said analysis.
All surcharges shall be based on the analysis of the wastes from any plant
or premises related to total volume of wastes determined under § 222-50
above. The average value of the concentration of pollutants measured
during a calendar year shall be used in calculating the industrial waste
surcharge. Whenever the wastes discharged from a premises to a public
sewer might be expected to show appreciable periodic variation during the
year due to manufacturing process or production variation due to seasonal
changes, the Board may average the results of the two (2) or more series of
analysis taken to reflect these variations and thereby determine an average
pollutant concentration.
§ 222-52. Pollutant concentration disputed by a user.
In the event that a user disputes the pollutant concentration of his or her
wastewater discharge determined in accordance with § 222-51 above, a
program of resampling and flow measurement with subsequent analytical
determination may be instituted as follows:
§ 222-53. Payment of industrial waste surcharge.
Payment of the industrial waste surcharge within the time period allotted
by the Joint Sewage Board shall be made to the Board by the industrial
A. The user must submit a request for resampling of the wastes and flow
measurement to the Board.
B. An independent consultant or agency of recognized professional
standing in the employ of the user must confer with representatives of
the Board in order that an agreement may be reached as to the various
factors which must be considered on a new sampling and flow
measurement program.
C. The consultant or agency of recognized professional standing employed
by the user shall conduct a resampling and reanalysis program, under
the direction of the Board, for at least two (2) twenty-four-hour periods.
D. The results of the resampling and the reanalysis shall be considered to
be the current analysis of the wastes discharged to the sewer system
and shall be used for determining the acceptability of the sampling and
analysis results in question. The new results may be used in place of the
results in question or in addition to other data collected by the Board
for determining the industrial waste surcharge and/or compliance with
the Board's rules and regulations.
E. All costs of sampling, analysis and flow measurements are to be paid by
the user.

be deemed a separate and distinct violation. Such penalty may be recovered
in an action brought by the Board's attorney in the name of the owners in
any court of competent jurisdiction. Such civil penalty may be released or
compromised by the Board only with the consent of the owners.
§ 222-55. Judicial enforcement.
In addition to the power to assess penalties as set forth in § 222-54 above,
the Joint Sewage Board shall have the power, following a hearing held
in conformance with the procedures set forth in § 222-15, to issue an
order suspending, revoking or modifying the violator's permit, enjoining the

regulations of the Board or with any determination issued thereunder by the
Board.
§ 222-59. Summary abatement.
Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of law, whenever the Board
finds, after investigation, that any user is causing, engaging in or
maintaining a condition or activity which, in its judgment, presents an
imminent danger to the public health, safety or welfare or to the
environment or is likely to result in irreversible or irreparable damage to
the public sewer system and it therefore appears to be prejudicial to the
public interest to delay action until notice and an opportunity for a hearing
can be provided, the Board may, without prior hearing, order such user
by notice, in writing wherever practicable or in such other form as in the
Board's judgment will reasonably notify such person whose practices are
intended to be proscribed, to discontinue, abate or alleviate such condition
or activity, and thereupon such person shall immediately discontinue, abate
or alleviate such condition or activity. In the event of a user's failure to
comply voluntarily with such emergency order or where the giving of notice
is impracticable, the Board may take all appropriate action to abate the
violating condition. As promptly as possible thereafter, not to exceed fifteen
(15) days, the Board shall provide the affected user an opportunity to be
heard in accordance with the provisions of §§ 222-14 and 222-15 of this Part
2.

engaging in or maintaining a condition or activity which in his or her
judgment presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety or
welfare or to the environment or is likely to result in irreversible or
irreparable damage to the public sewer system and it therefore appears

premises from the village public sewer system. As promptly as possible
thereafter, not to exceed fifteen (15) days, the Director shall provide the

village enjoining the violator from continuing the violation. Any such
order of the Board shall be enforceable in an action brought by the
Board's attorney in any court of competent jurisdiction.

This chapter shall be known as the "Law Regulating the Movement of
Certain Convicted Sex Offenders in Certain Sections of the Village of
Johnson City."
§ 223-2. Statutory authority.
This chapter is hereby adopted and enacted pursuant to the authority
conferred by the New York State Municipal Home Rule Law, which enables
local governments to adopt local laws relating to their property, affairs, or
government, so long as the local laws are not inconsistent with the New
York State Constitution or any general law of New York State. The New
York State Municipal Home Rule Law also authorizes local governments to
adopt local laws regulating the protection, order, conduct, safety, health
and welfare of the persons within the local municipality. This chapter is
adopted in recognition of the recently enacted Chapter 544 of the Laws
of 2005 of the State of New York, which prohibits certain sex offenders
placed on conditional release or parole or probation from entering upon
school grounds or other facilities where children are cared for. The Village
of Johnson City Board of Trustees has determined that this chapter is not
inconsistent with said Chapter 544 of the Laws of 2005.

SHOPPING CARTS
§ 225-1. Legislative findings and considerations.
The Village Board of the Village of Johnson City hereby finds and declares
that abandoned shopping carts pose a serious problem for its residents
and merchants. The unabated proliferation of abandoned shopping carts is
a physical hazard and blight upon the landscape of our Village and costs
taxpayers, merchants and homeowners substantial monies to avoid and
remove. Shopping cart abandonment is harmful to the public and violates
the welfare and general good of the citizens and residents of the Village.
§ 225-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
ABANDONMENT  The act of leaving, deserting or giving up control and/
or possession of a shopping cart in a public place.
PUBLIC PLACE  Any street, highway, sidewalk or other publicly owned
property to which the public or a substantial number of persons have
access.
SHOPPING CART  Any device, vehicle or wheeled container of the kind
customarily provided by merchants to customers for the purpose of carrying
merchandise.

§ 225-3. Shopping carts to be marked.
Every supermarket or business establishment operating within the Village,
or whose operations touch, border, concern or otherwise involve the Village
and/or its residents, that makes shopping carts available to the public shall
permanently mark said carts with the name and address of the owner.
§ 225-4. Removal of shopping carts from establishments; penalties
for offenses.
It shall be unlawful for any person to remove a shopping cart or permit
the removal of a shopping cart from the property of the establishment or
business that makes said cart available, except that such a cart may be
removed to a parking area adjoining the property of said establishment or
business. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the owner of a shopping cart, or
his/her duly authorized agent, may remove his/her shopping cart from the
property of the establishment or business, so long as such removal does not
result in the abandonment of a shopping cart within the Village. Violation
of this section shall be punishable as set forth in Chapter 1, § 1-15 of this
Code.

§ 237-8. Prevention control and reduction of stormwater pollutants.
A. Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit
discharges as defined in § 237-2 or activities contaminating stormwater
as defined in § 237-8, the municipality may require implementation of
best management practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges
and activities.
(1) The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment
shall provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection
from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
into the MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural
BMPs.
(2) Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may
be, the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 237-2 or an
activity contaminating stormwater as defined in § 237-7, may be
required to implement, at said person's expense, additional
structural and nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the
source of pollutant(s) to the MS4.
(3) Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with
the provisions of this section.
B. Individual sewage treatment systems; response to special conditions
requiring no increase of pollutants or requiring a reduction of
pollutants. Where individual sewage treatment systems are
contributing to the municipality's being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 237-2 of this article, the owner or operator of
such individual sewage treatment systems shall be required to:
(1) Maintain and operate individual sewage treatment systems as
follows:
(a) Inspect the septic tank annually to determine scum and sludge
accumulation. Septic tanks must be pumped out whenever the
bottom of the scum layer is within three inches of the bottom of
the outlet baffle or sanitary tee or the top of the sludge is
within 10 inches of the bottom of the outlet baffle or sanitary
tee.
(b) Avoid the use of septic tank additives.
(c) Avoid the disposal of excessive quantities of detergents,
kitchen wastes, laundry wastes, and household chemicals; and
(d) Avoid the disposal of cigarette butts, disposable diapers,
sanitary napkins, trash and other such items.
(2) Most tanks should be pumped out every two to three years.
However, pumping may be more or less frequent, depending on

§ 237-9. Suspension of access to MS4.
use. Inspection of the tank for cracks, leaks and blockages should
be done by the septage hauler at the time of pumping of the tank
contents.
(3) Repair or replace individual sewage treatment systems as follows:
(a) In accordance with 10 NYCRR, Appendix 75-A to the maximum
extent practicable.
(b) A design professional licensed to practice in New York State
shall prepare design plans for any type of absorption field that
involves:
[1] Relocating or extending an absorption area to a location
not previously approved for such.
[2] Installation of a new subsurface treatment system at the
same location.
[3] Use of alternate system or innovative system design or
technology.
(c) A written certificate of compliance shall be submitted by the
design professional to the municipality at the completion of
construction of the repair or replacement system.
A. Illicit discharges in emergency situations. The SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
§ 237-8 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 237-10
237:410
§ 237-10. Industrial or construction activity discharges.

stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 237-11. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.

subject to this article such devices as are necessary in the opinion
of the SMO to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this article. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
§ 237-10 STORM SEWERS § 237-11
237:411
§ 237-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 237-13. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
A. Notice of violation.
(1) When the municipality's SMO finds that a person has violated a
prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, he/she
may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(a) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(b) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desist;
(c) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected

Findings of Fact; Purpose; Statutory Authority; Applicability;
Exemptions
§ 238-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 238-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.

included therein. Every return shall have annexed thereto a

or of a copartner thereof or of a principal officer of the corporation, if
such business is conducted by a corporation, to the effect that the
statements contained therein are true.

§ 250-6. Insufficient returns.73
In case any return filed pursuant to this Article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Village Treasurer and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within twenty (20) days after the same is required by
notice from the Village Treasurer or if no return is made for any period,
from such information as he or she is able to obtain, and if necessary, the
Village Treasurer may estimate the tax on the basis of external indices or
otherwise. The Village Treasurer shall give notice of such determination
to the person liable for such tax. Such determination shall finally and
irrevocably fix such tax, unless the person against whom it is assessed shall,
within thirty (30) days after the giving of notice of such determination,
apply to the Village Treasurer for a hearing or unless the Village Treasurer,
of his or her own motion, shall reduce the same. After such hearing, the
Village Treasurer shall give notice of his or her decision to the person
liable for the tax. The decision of the Village Treasurer may be reviewed
by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York, if application therefor is made within thirty (30)
days after the giving of notice of such decision. An order to review such
decision shall not be granted unless the amount of any tax sought to be
reviewed, with interest and penalties thereon, if any, shall be first deposited
with the Village Treasurer and an undertaking filed with him or her, in
such amount and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall
approve to the effect that if such order is dismissed or the tax confirmed,
the applicant for the order will pay all costs and charges which may accrue
in the prosecution of such proceeding, or at the option of the applicant, such
undertaking may be in a sum sufficient to cover the tax, interest, penalties,
costs and charges aforesaid, in which event the applicant shall not be
required to pay such tax, interest and penalties as a condition precedent to
the granting of such order.
§ 250-7. Notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this Article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him or
her in the last return filed by him or her under this Article or, if no return
has been filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of
such notice shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by
the person to whom addressed. Any period of time, which is determined
according to the provisions of this Article by the giving of notice, shall
commence to run from the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 250-8. Failure to file; penalty.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return or to pay a tax or
any portion thereof within the time required by this Article shall be subject

such tax became due, but the Village Treasurer, if satisfied that the delay
was excusable, may remit all or any portion of the penalty fixed by the
foregoing provisions of this section.
§ 250-9. Refunds.
If within one (1) year from the payment of any tax or penalty the payer
thereof shall make application for a refund thereof and the Village
Treasurer or the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any
portion thereof was erroneously or illegally collected, the Village Treasurer
shall refund the amount so determined. For like cause and within the same
period, a refund may be so made on the initiative of the Village Treasurer.
However, no refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to
a determination of the Village Treasurer as hereinbefore provided unless
the Village Treasurer, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided or of his
or her own motion, shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have
been established in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules of the State of New York that such determination was erroneous
or illegal. All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this
Article. An application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall
be deemed an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained
of, and the Village Treasurer may receive additional evidence with respect
thereto. After making his or her determination, the Village Treasurer shall
give notice thereof to the person interested, and he or she shall be entitled
to an order to review such determination under said Article 78, subject to
the provisions hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such an
order.
§ 250-10. Tax not chargeable to customers.
The tax imposed by this Article shall be charged against and be paid by the
utility and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the
utility to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating
cost of such utility.
§ 250-11. When tax to constitute lien.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by this
Article, the Village Attorney shall, upon the request of the Village Treasurer,
bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of any
judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Village Treasurer.
Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the person
liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent that the
tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.

ARTICLE III
Targeted Business Investment Exemption
[Adopted 3-20-2007 by L.L. No. 1-200776]
§ 250-17. Purpose.
A. The Town of Union has established and appointed an Industrial and
Commercial Incentive Board ("ICIB") that includes Village residents
and the ICIB has recommended a plan to the Town Board of the Town of
Union concerning the various types of business real property which
should be granted eligibility for an exemption pursuant to § 485-b(9)(b)
of the Real Property Tax Law ("RPTL") ("Plan"). The Town of Union has
accepted the Plan and approved implementation of a local law
regarding the same.
B. The Village Board of the Village of Johnson City has reviewed the Plan
proposed by the ICIB to implement a targeted business investment
exemption and determined that the Plan is the product of the research
and study conducted by the ICIB. In addition, the Plan has been
reviewed by the Johnson City Planning Department and it is determined
that the plan takes into consideration the planning objectives of the
Village of Johnson City within the proposed geographic area, the
necessity of the exemption to the attraction of retention of such
businesses and the economic benefit to the area of providing the
targeted business investment exemption.
C. Section 485-b of the RPTL further provides that the Village Board may,
after the presentation of the findings of the ICIB, adopt by local law a
restricted real property tax exemption targeted, among other criteria,
to specific geographic areas identified in the Plan presented by the
ICIB.
D. The Village Board finds that the implementation of a targeted business
investment exemption will encourage private investment, thereby
benefiting all of the residents of the Village of Johnson City by the
creation of and retention of private sector jobs. The Village Board
further finds that the exemptions are necessary to encourage targeted
economic development and the value of the exemptions is justified by
the need to provide employment opportunities and broaden the tax
base. The targeted business investment exemptions will particularly aid
in the revitalization or maintenance of certain identified commercial
areas in the Village of Johnson City.
E. Accordingly, the Village Board of the Village of Johnson City has
determined that it is in the best interest of the Village to implement a
targeted business investment exemption and the Village Board hereby
enacts the following article pursuant to the authority provided under
Real Property Tax Law § 485-b for certain real property constructed,
76.1 Editors Note: This local law also repealed former Art. III, Business Investment
Exemption, adopted 7-18-1977 by L.L. No. 10-1977 (Division 2 of Subpart N of Part I of

altered, installed or improved subsequent to the enactment of this
article for commercial, business or industrial activity.
A. Certain real property constructed, altered, installed or improved
subsequent to the effective date of this article for the purpose of
commercial, business or industrial activity and which is contained
within the geographic areas of the Village set forth in § 250-19 shall be
exempt from taxation and special ad valorem levies, except for special
ad valorem levies for fire district, fire protection district and fire alarm
district purposes, to the extent hereinafter provided.
B. Computation; exceptions; applicability.
(1) Computation of exemption.
(a) Such real property located within the geographic area(s) set
forth in § 250-19 of this article shall be exempt for a period of
one year to the extent of 50% of the increase in assessed value
thereof attributable to such construction, alteration,
installation or improvement and for an additional period of
nine years; provided, however, that the extent of such
exemption shall be decreased by 5% each year during such
additional period of nine years, and such exemption shall be
computed with respect to the exemption base. The "exemption
base" shall be the increase in assessed value as determined in
the initial year of such ten-year period following the filing of an
original application, except as provided in Subsection B(1)(b)
of this section.
(b) In any year in which a change in level of assessment of 15% or
more is certified for a final assessment roll pursuant to the
rules of the state board, the exemption base shall be multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total
assessed value of the parcel on such final assessment roll (after
accounting for any physical or quantity changes to the parcel
since the immediately preceding assessment roll) and the
denominator of which shall be the total assessed value of the
parcel on the immediately preceding final assessment roll. The
result shall be the new exemption base. The exemption shall
thereupon be recomputed to take into account the new
exemption base, notwithstanding the fact that the Assessor
receives the certification of the change in level of assessment
after the completion, verification and filing of the final
assessment roll. In the event that the Assessor does not have
custody of the roll when such certification is received, the
Assessor shall certify the recomputed exemption to the local
officers having custody and control of the roll, and such local
officers are hereby directed and authorized to enter the
recomputed exemption certified by the Assessor on the roll.
§ 250-17 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 250-18
237:492
The assessor shall give written notice of such recomputed
exemption to the property owner, who may, if he or she
believes that the exemption was recomputed incorrectly, apply
for a correction in the manner provided by Title 3 of Article 5
of the New York State Real Property Tax Law for the correction
of clerical errors.
(c) The following table shall illustrate the computation of the tax
exemption:
Year of Exemption Percentage of Exemption

3 40%
4 35%
5 30%
6 25%
7 20%
8 15%
9 10%
10 5%
(2) No such exemption shall be granted unless:
(a) Such construction, alteration, installation or improvement was
commenced subsequent to the adoption of this article.
(b) The cost of such construction, alteration, installation or
improvement exceeds the sum of $50,000.
(c) Such construction, alteration, installation or improvement is
completed as may be evidenced by a certificate of occupancy
or other appropriate documentation as provided by the owner.
(3) For purposes of this section, the terms "construction," "alteration,"
"installation" and "improvement" shall not include ordinary
maintenance and repairs.
(4) No such exemption shall be granted concurrent with or subsequent
to any other real property tax exemption granted to the same
improvements to real property except, where during the period of
such previous exemption, payments in lieu of taxes or other
payments were made to the local government in an amount that
would have been paid on such improvements had such property
been granted an exemption pursuant to this article. In such case,
an exemption shall be granted for a number of years equal to the
ten-year exemption granted pursuant to this section less the

number of years the property would have been previously exempt
from real property taxes.
C. Such exemption shall be granted only upon application by the owner of
such real property on a form prescribed by the state board. Such
application shall be filed with the Assessor of the Village having the
power to assess property for taxation on or before the appropriate
taxable status date of the village, town or county and within one year
from the date of completion of such construction, alteration, installation
or improvement.
D. If the Assessor is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to an exemption
pursuant to this section, he or she shall approve the application and
such real property shall thereafter be exempt from taxation and special
ad valorem levies, except for special ad valorem levies for fire district,
fire protection district and fire alarm district purposes, as herein
provided, commencing with the assessment roll prepared after the
taxable status date of March 1 of each year. The assessed value of any
exemption granted pursuant to this section shall be entered by the
Assessor on the assessment roll with the taxable property, with the
amount of the exemption shown in a separate column.
E. The provisions of this section shall apply to real property used primarily
for the buying, selling, storing or developing goods or services, the
manufacture or assembly of goods or the processing of raw materials.
This section shall not apply to property used primarily for the furnishing
of dwelling space or accommodations to either residents or transients

section ceases to be used primarily for eligible purposes, the exemption
granted pursuant to this section shall cease.

while regulating their locations and number in the community.
(2) Minimizing adverse visual impacts of these towers/antennas
through proper siting, design and screening.
(3) Preserving and enhancing the positive aesthetic qualities of the
natural environment and current development in the Village of
Johnson City.
(4) Providing for the health, safety and welfare of the community by
avoiding potential damage or other negative impact to adjacent
properties from power failure, falling ice, etc., through proper
siting and engineering.
(5) Requiring the joint use of towers when available and encouraging
the placement of antennas on existing structures to minimize the
number of such structures in the future.

applicant. Tower special use permits are not assignable and
nontransferable, except upon approval by resolution of the Village of
Johnson City Zoning Board.
B. The Village may express a preference for an alternative site(s) and/or
that the proposed telecommunications facility be located in a higherintensity-
use district or on higher-intensity-use property, provided that
there is a technologically feasible and available location. A guideline for
the Village's preference, from most desirable to least desirable zoning
district/property, is as follows:
(1) Property with an existing structure suitable for collocation.
(2) Municipal or government-owned property.
(3) Industrial (IN) or General Commercial (GC) Zoning Districts.
(4) Neighborhood Commercial (NC) and Central Business (CB) Zoning
Districts.
(5) Commercial Office (CO) Zoning District, and any over lay districts.
(6) Rural Residential (RR), Urban Single-Family (USF), Suburban
Single-Family (SSF), Urban Two-Family (UTF), Urban Multifamily
(UMF) and Suburban Multifamily (SMF) Zoning Districts.

important preservation/conservation areas.
C. Any request by the Village for information or technical analysis on a
preferred alternate site shall be provided by the applicant at its sole
cost and shall not unreasonably delay the application.
D. Aesthetics. Telecommunications facilities shall be located and buffered
to the maximum extent that is practical and technologically feasible to
help ensure compatibility with surrounding land uses. In order to
minimize any adverse aesthetic effect on neighboring residences to the
extent possible, the Village of Johnson City Planning Board may impose
reasonable conditions on the applicant, including, but not limited to,
the following:
§ 256-3 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 256-4
237:512
(1) Tower height, including antennas, and design are matters of
primary public concern. The Board may require a monopole or
guyed tower (if sufficient land is available to the applicant) instead
of a freestanding tower. Monopoles are a preferred design. The
Board may impose reasonable restrictions and/or conditions on
height. For example, the Board may reasonably determine that
adverse impact upon the community will be best mitigated by
requiring the applicant to construct multiple towers of lower height
at several different locations to meet the applicant's demonstrated
service coverage requirement(s) or that the tower height be
reduced in the future if the applicant is unable to demonstrate a
continuing need for the approval height in light of changes in the
applicant's service coverage needs or technological advances.
(2) The Board may require reasonable landscaping consisting of trees
or shrubs to screen the base of the tower and antennas and/or to
screen the tower and any accessory structure or buildings to the
extent possible from adjacent residential property. Existing on-site
trees and vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent
possible.
(3) The Board may require the applicant to show that it has made goodfaith
efforts to collocate on existing towers or other available and
appropriate structures and/or to construct new towers near
existing towers in an effort to consolidate visual disturbances.
However, such request shall not unreasonably delay the
application.
(4) The type of finish, color and lighting shall be subject to Village and/
or Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) approval. The Village may
require lights to be shielded to minimize ground visual impact.
(5) No tower shall contain any signs or advertising devices.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Board may require appropriate
signage indicating ownership of the facility and phone numbers to
call in case of emergency.
(6) The applicant must submit a copy of its policy regarding collocation
on the proposed tower with other potential future applicants. Such
policy should allow collocation under the following conditions:
(a) The new antenna(s) and equipment do not exceed structural
loading requirements, interfere with Village space used or to
be used by the applicant or pose any technical or radio
frequency interference with existing equipment.
(b) The party desiring to collocate pays the applicant an
appropriate and reasonable sum to collocate.
(c) The party desiring to collocate has a similar policy of
collocation for the applicant.
§ 256-4 STORM SEWERS § 256-4
237:513
(7) All other uses ancillary to the antenna and associated equipment
(including a business office, maintenance depot, vehicle storage,
etc.) are prohibited from the site unless otherwise permitted in the
zoning district in which the facility is located.
E. Radio frequency; inspections.
(1) The Village of Johnson City Planning Board shall impose a condition
on the applicant that the communications antenna will be operated
only at Federal Communication Commission (FCC) designated
frequencies and power levels and/or Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA) technical exposure limits and may periodically
require that the applicant provide competent documentation to
support that maximum allowable frequencies, power levels and
exposure limits for radiation will not be exceeded.
(2) Unless otherwise preempted by federal or state law, the
telecommunications facility shall be inspected every two years, at
the applicant's expense, for radio emissions, and a copy of the
report shall be promptly delivered to the Building Inspector. A
licensed professional engineer specializing in electrical
engineering with expertise in radio communications facilities shall
perform radio emission inspections. The radio emission inspection
shall describe the power density levels of the electromagnetic
energy generated from the facility, including the cumulative effects
of collocated antennas. In the event that the radio emission
inspection indicates that the electromagnetic energy generated
from the facility is above the allowable limits stated with applicable
FCC or ANSI standards or other applicable federal or state
guidelines in effect at the time of inspection, the applicant shall
cease all use of the facility until such time as it proves, to the
satisfaction of the Building Inspector or pertinent Village
consultant, that the power density levels of the electromagnetic
energy to be generated at the facility are below the applicable
standards.
F. Traffic, access, and safety.
(1) A road turnaround and one parking space shall be provided to
assure adequate year-round emergency and service access.
Maximum use of existing roads, public or private, shall be made.
The use of public roadways or road rights-of-way for the siting of a
tower or antenna(s) accessory structures is prohibited.
(2) All towers and ground anchors, if applicable, shall be enclosed by a
fence not less than eight feet in height and otherwise sufficiently
protected from trespassing or vandalism.
(3) The applicant must comply with all applicable state and federal
regulations, including, but not limited to, FAA and FCC regulations,
and from time to time may be required to provide certification of
such compliance.
§ 256-4 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 256-4
237:514
§ 256-5. Exemptions.
Exemptions are as follows:
(4) All towers and antennas shall include anticlimbing devices for a
minimum of 25 feet extending above ground level.
G. Removal of tower.
(1) The applicant shall agree to remove the tower and antenna if the
telecommunications facility becomes obsolete or ceases to be used
for its intended purpose for 12 consecutive months. The Village of
Johnson City Planning Board shall require the applicant to provide
an appropriate and adequate demolition bond for the purpose of
removing the telecommunications facility and restoration of the
land in case the applicant fails to do so as required above.
(2) The sufficiency of the demolition bond shall be confirmed at least
every five years by analysis and report of the cost of removal and
property restoration, which is to be performed by a licensed
professional engineer, the cost of same to be borne by the
applicant. If the said analysis and report determines that the
amount of the bond in force is insufficient to cover the removal,
disposal and restoration costs, the bond shall be increased to the
amount necessary to cover such costs within 10 days of the
applicant's receipt of such report.
H. Structural safety.
(1) During the application process and after construction of the tower,
the applicant shall provide a certification from a qualified licensed
professional engineer, certifying that the tower and antennas meet
applicable New York State and ANSI structural safety standards.
(2) Unless otherwise preempted by federal or state law, the
telecommunications facility shall be inspected every two years, at
the applicant's expense, for structural integrity. A copy of the
report shall be promptly delivered to the Building Inspector. A
licensed professional engineer specializing in structural
engineering shall perform the structural inspection. The structural
inspection report shall describe the structural integrity of the
facility, maintenance issues and repairs needed or made, if any. In
the event that the structural inspection indicates structural
deficiencies, then the deficiencies must be remedied within the
time reasonably set by the Building Inspector. Upon the applicant's
failure to do so, the permit may be revoked.
I. Maintenance of telecommunications facility. All telecommunications
facilities shall be maintained in good order and repair. The Village may
require that reasonable records of such maintenance be kept and
available for Village review upon request.

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 270-1. Purpose.
§ 270-2. Regulations to constitute part of contract.
The following regulations set forth in this Part 1 shall be considered as part
of the contract of the Water Department by and on behalf of the Village of
Johnson City and binding upon every person who takes water supplied by
the Department.
§ 270-3. Amendments.
The regulations set forth in this Part 1 may be amended, revised or repealed
from time to time by the Board of Trustees of the Village of Johnson City in
the manner provided by law.
§ 270-4. Definitions.
As used in this Part 1, the following words, terms and phrases shall have the
meanings ascribed to them in this section:
APPLICANT  The owner of property or his or her agent applying for water
service.
COMMERCIAL SERVICE  Provision of water to premises where the
customer is engaged in trade.
CUSTOMER  The owner of real property receiving water services from
the Department.
DATE OF PRESENTATION  The date upon which a bill or notice is mailed
or delivered personally to the customer.
DEPARTMENT  The Water Department of the Village of Johnson City.
A. It is recognized that a water utility must employ standards and a system
of practices to serve the public in an orderly and effective manner.
B. The supplying of water to a populace from a common pipe system is a
communal function. The water utility and the individual consumer are
involved in business transactions and other obligations which mutually
affect not only the individual and the utility but also all others in a
community.
C. The purpose of this Part 1 is twofold: First, to define the authority and
responsibility of all Department personnel in their relations with the
consuming public; and second, to provide the consuming public with a
written statement of conditions under which water service will be

classification specified in § 270-6. All water bills shall be rendered on a
combination bill, together with the sewer bill for the applicable property.
§ 270-58. Proration of charges.
For new services installed at any time during the billing period, the
minimum charge and the amount of water allowed thereunder will be
prorated according to the number of days remaining to complete the billing
period after the service has been placed in use by the owner.
§ 270-59. Meter reading and billing.
Meters will be read biannually, quarterly or monthly and customers will be
billed biannually, quarterly or monthly at the Department's option, subject
to the approval of the Board of Trustees.
§ 270-60. Determination of quantity of water used.
The quantity recorded by the meter shall be considered the amount of water
passing through the meter, which amount shall be conclusive on both the
customer and the Department except where it appears that the meter has
ceased to register or has registered inaccurately.
§ 270-61. Meters to be read separately.
Each meter on a customer's premises will be considered separately, and
readings of two or more meters will not be combined unless specifically
provided for in the rate schedule or unless the Department's operating
convenience requires the use of more than one meter or of a battery of
meters.
§ 270-62. Estimated bill; manner of determination.
In cases where it is found that the meter has ceased to register, an
estimated bill for the billing period immediately preceding the date when
such meter was found defective and for the period from said date to the
date of replacement of the meter may be rendered the customer. The
estimated bill shall be based upon the amount of water consumed in the
corresponding period in prior years, except where it appears that there has
been a change in occupancy of the premises or in the use of water or where
no prior experience exists, by the average registration of an operating
meter in subsequent periods or by equitable adjustment, whichever method
is representative, in the Department's opinion, of the conditions existing
during the period in question.

applying to the Department, have the meter reread and the account
rechecked. The Department will render every reasonable assistance in
determining the reason for any high or unusual bill.
B. Testing meter to determine if defective. A customer may, by giving
reasonable notice, request the Department to test the meter serving his
or her premises. The Department requires that the test shall be made in
the presence of the customer or his or her representative. The
Department will require a deposit to cover such costs. This deposit will
be refunded if the test reveals an overcharge, and the bill correction
will be made as provided in § 270-66A.
A. Fast meters. When, upon test, a meter is found to be registering more
than 4% fast under conditions of normal operations, the Department
will refund to the customer the full amount of the overcharge based
upon corrected meter readings for the period, not exceeding one year
that the meter was in use.
B. Slow meters. When, upon test, a meter used for domestic or residential
service is found to be registering more than 25% slow, the utility may
bill the customer for the amount of the undercharge based upon
corrected meter readings for the period not exceeding one year that the
meter was in use.
§ 270-63 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 270-66
237:632
C. When upon test, a meter use for other than domestic or residential
service is found to be registering more than 5% slow, the Department

General Provisions
§ 270-96. Levy and assessment of taxes for payment.
If the Village of Johnson City has heretofore issued or shall hereafter
issue bonds for the purpose of paying the cost of constructing in said
village a water system or a portion thereof, the Board of Trustees may,
notwithstanding that any part of the expense of constructing such water
system has theretofore been assessed upon lands benefited, determine and
order that any portion of such cost, not exceeding in amount the aggregate
amount of such bonds then outstanding, shall be assessed upon the lands
benefited by the construction of such water system in the manner provided
in this section. Any such resolution shall determine the aggregate amount
of such bonds which shall then be outstanding and unpaid and shall fix the
portion of each installment of maturities of said bonds which is thereafter
to be assessed upon lands benefited in the manner provided in this section.
Any such resolution shall be subject to a permissive referendum. Prior to
the first day of May in each year, the Board of Trustees shall compute the
aggregate amount of the portion of the principal of said bonds to become
due during the ensuing fiscal year which is required by said resolution to
be assessed upon the lands benefited, and also the interest on such portion
of said bonds to become due during such fiscal year, and shall assess such
amount on the lands within said village in proportion as nearly as may be
to the benefit which each lot or parcel will derive from the construction of
said water system. After making such apportionment, the Board of Trustees
shall serve on the owner of each such lot or parcel of land a notice of the
completion of such apportionment and that at a specified time and place a
hearing will be held to consider and review the same, by publishing such
notice once a week for two weeks in a newspaper published or circulated in
said village. The Board of Trustees shall meet at the time and place specified
in such notice and hear objections to such apportionment and may modify
and correct the same. The Board of Trustees, upon the completion and
correction of such apportionment, shall forthwith file the same in the office
of the Village Clerk and shall give notice of the filing of such completed and
corrected apportionment in the manner provided for by § 29 of the Tax Law
as to towns. The apportionment shall then be deemed final and conclusive,
unless an appeal is taken therefrom as hereinafter provided within 15 days
after the filing thereof. The Board of Trustees shall, in the annual tax levy
for such fiscal year, levy upon each such lot or parcel of land the sum so
apportioned to such lot or parcel of land, and the amount so levied shall be
collected in the same manner as other village taxes. In the event that any
such resolution shall become effective, any lot or parcel of land assessed
by any previous assessment or apportionment of any part of the cost of
constructing such water system shall be freed from the lien of such former
assessment or apportionment, except to the extent that any part of such
cost so apportioned to such lot or parcel of land shall have been included in

Legal Framework
§ 300-10.1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Consolidated Zoning
Ordinance of the Town of Union, Village of Johnson City, and Village of
Endicott, New York." For convenience, it is referred to throughout this
chapter as the "Zoning Ordinance" or "Zoning Code."
§ 300-10.2. Effective date.
The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance become effective on June 1, 2011,
except as otherwise expressly stated.
§ 300-10.3. Authority.
This Zoning Ordinance is adopted pursuant to the powers granted and
limitations imposed by legislation of the State of New York.
§ 300-10.4. Applicability.
The regulations of this Zoning Ordinance apply to all development, public or
private, within the corporate limits of the Town of Union and the Villages of
Endicott and Johnson City unless otherwise expressly stated in this Zoning
Ordinance.
§ 300-10.5. Purposes.
There is hereby established a new comprehensive Zoning Ordinance for
the Town of Union and the Villages of Johnson City and Endicott, which
is set forth in the text, tables, illustrations and map that constitute this
chapter. The Zoning Ordinance is adopted to promote and protect the
public health, safety and general welfare and provide for solar access. The
Zoning Ordinance implements the goals and objectives of the 2008 Unified
Comprehensive Plan, which include:
A. Providing a wide variety of living environments for all socioeconomic
groups in the population and a diversity of housing densities and types,
ranging from rural low density to urban high density.
B. Providing a sound commercial base, offering convenience, choice and a
wide variety of goods and services.
C. Improving the economy by promoting new and expanded industrial
enterprises, retaining existing enterprises and redeveloping existing
industrial facilities in order to further diversify the economic base and
to provide for increased employment on a permanent basis.
§ 300-10.1 STORM SEWERS § 300-10.5
237:683
§ 300-10.6. Provisions deemed to be minimum requirements;
compliance with other applicable regulations.
§ 300-10.7. Conflicting provisions.
D. Providing a transportation network which is capable of moving people
and goods efficiently and safely.
E. Maintaining the infrastructure at a level needed to continue adequate
services to Town and Village residents.
F. Enriching the lives of all citizens by striving to improve the quality of
the environment.
G. Accommodating solar energy systems, equipment and access to
sunlight.
A. The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance are the minimum requirements
deemed necessary to carry out the Zoning Ordinance's stated purpose
and intent.
B. In addition to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance, all uses and
development must comply with all other applicable Village, Town, state,
and federal regulations.
C. All references in the Zoning Ordinance to other Village, Town, state, or
federal regulations are for informational purposes only and do not
constitute a complete list of such regulations. These references do not
imply any responsibility for the Town or Villages to enforce state or
federal regulations.
A. Conflict with state or federal regulations. If the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance are inconsistent with those of the state or federal
government, the more restrictive provision will control, to the extent
permitted by law. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes
greater restrictions or more stringent controls.
B. Conflict with other Town or Village regulations. If the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict
with provisions found in other adopted ordinances or regulations of the
Town or Villages, the more restrictive provision will control. The more
restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater restrictions or
more stringent controls.
C. Conflict with private agreements and covenants. This Zoning Ordinance
is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement,
covenant, deed restriction or other agreement between private parties.
If the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance impose a greater restriction
than imposed by a private agreement, the provisions of this Zoning
Ordinance will control. If the provisions of a valid, enforceable private
agreement impose a greater restriction than this Zoning Ordinance, the

ARTICLE 11
General Rules of Language and Interpretation
§ 300-11.1. Meaning and intent.
The language of the Zoning Ordinance must be read literally. Regulations
are no more or less strict than stated. Words defined in Article 71 (General
Terms) have the specific meaning assigned, unless the context expressly
indicates another meaning. Words that are not defined in Article 71 have
the meaning given in the latest edition of Merriam-Webster's Unabridged
Dictionary.
§ 300-11.2. Tenses and word usage.
§ 300-11.3. Conjunctions.
Unless the context otherwise clearly indicates, conjunctions have the
following meanings:
§ 300-11.4. Fractions.
The following rules apply to fractional number unless otherwise expressly
stated.
A. Words used in the singular include the plural. The reverse is also true.
B. Words used in the present tense include the future tense. The reverse is
also true.
C. The words "must," "will," "shall" and "may not" are mandatory.
D. The word "may" is permissive, and "should" is advisory, not mandatory
or required.
E. When used with numbers, "up to X," "not more than X" and "a maximum
of X" all include X.
A. "And" indicates that all connected items or provisions apply; and
B. "Or" indicates that the connected items or provisions may apply
singularly or in combination.
A. Minimum requirements. When a regulation is expressed in terms of a
minimum requirement, any fractional result of 0.5 or more must be
rounded up to the next consecutive whole number. For example, if a
minimum requirement calling for one tree to be provided for every 30
linear feet of frontage is applied to a fifty-foot dimension, the resulting
fraction of 1.67 is rounded up to two required trees.
B. Maximum limits. When a regulation is expressed in terms of maximum
limits, any fractional result will be rounded down to the next lower
whole number. For example, if a maximum limit of one dwelling unit for
every 5,000 square feet is applied to a lot of 12,500 square feet, the

237:687
§ 300-11.5. Headings and illustrations.
Headings and illustrations are provided for convenience and reference
only and do not define or limit the scope of any provision of this Zoning
Ordinance. In case of any difference of meaning or implication between the
text of this Zoning Ordinance and any heading, drawing, table, figure, or
illustration, the text controls.
§ 300-11.6. Current versions and citations.
All references to other Village, Town, county, state, or federal regulations
in the Zoning Ordinance refer to the most current version and citation
for those regulations, unless expressly indicated otherwise. When the
referenced regulations have been repealed and not replaced by other
regulations, Zoning Ordinance requirements for compliance are no longer
in effect.
§ 300-11.7. Lists and examples.
Unless otherwise expressly indicated, lists of items or examples that use
"including," "such as," or similar terms are intended to provide examples
only. They are not to be construed as exhaustive lists of all possibilities.
§ 300-11.8. Delegation of authority.
Whenever a provision appears requiring the head of a department or
another officer or employee of the Town or Villages to perform an act or
duty, that provision will be construed as authorizing the department head
or officer to delegate that responsibility to others over whom they have
authority. Delegation of authority is not allowed when the provisions of this
Zoning Ordinance expressly prohibit such a delegation.
§ 300-11.9. Public officials and agencies.
All employees, public officials, bodies, and agencies to which references are
made are those of the Town of Union or the Villages of Johnson City or
Endicott unless otherwise expressly stated.
§ 300-11.10. Commentaries.
Commentaries are sometimes included in the Zoning Ordinance as a means
of clarifying certain provisions or providing supplemental information. Text
marked as "Commentary" has no regulatory effect. It is intended solely as
a guide for administrative officials and the public. Commentaries may be
added to the Zoning Ordinance by the Planning Director without the need
for a formal ordinance amendment.

Zoning Map
§ 300-12.1. Establishment.
The location and boundaries of the zoning districts established by this
Zoning Ordinance are shown on a zoning map maintained by the Planning
Director and the Town and Village Boards. The Planning Director will be
responsible for keeping the Zoning Map up-to-date. The Official Zoning
Map, together with all notations, references, data and other information
shown on the Map, is adopted and incorporated into this Zoning
Ordinance.92 It is as much a part of this Zoning Ordinance as if actually
depicted within its pages.
§ 300-12.2. Maintenance and updates.
The Planning Director is responsible for directing revisions to the Official
Zoning Map to reflect its amendment as soon as possible after the effective
date of Zoning Map amendments (rezonings). No unauthorized person may
alter or modify the Official Zoning Map. The Planning Director may
authorize printed copies of the Official Zoning Map to be produced, and
must maintain digital or printed copies of superseded versions of the Official
Zoning Map for historical reference.
§ 300-12.3. District boundaries.
When the ordinance establishing a zoning boundary identifies the boundary
as following a particular feature, or reflects a clear intent that the boundary
follows the feature, the boundary will be construed as following that feature
as it actually exists. The Official Zoning Map must note any such
relationship between a zoning boundary and other mapped feature on the
Zoning Map when entering the zoning boundary.
§ 300-12.4. Interpretations of district boundaries.
Where any uncertainty exists about a zoning boundary, the actual location
of the boundary will be determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals using
the following rules of interpretation:
A. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a
river, stream, lake or other watercourse will be construed as following
the actual center line of the watercourse. If, subsequent to the
establishment of the boundary, the center line of the watercourse
should move as a result of natural processes (flooding, erosion,
sedimentation, etc.), the boundary will be construed as moving with the
center line of the watercourse.
B. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a
ridgeline or topographic contour line will be construed as following the

actual ridgeline or contour line. If, subsequent to the establishment of
the boundary, the ridgeline or contour line should move as a result of
natural processes (erosion, slippage, subsidence, etc.), the boundary
will be construed as moving with the ridgeline or contour line.
C. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a lot
line or parcel boundary will be construed as following the lot line or
parcel boundary as it actually existed at the time the zoning boundary
was established.
D. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following a
street or railroad line will be construed as following the center line of
the street or railroad right-of-way.
E. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately following the
boundary of an adjacent municipality will be construed as following that
boundary.
F. A boundary shown on the Zoning Map as approximately parallel to, or
as an apparent extension of, a feature described above will be
construed as being actually parallel to, or an extension of, the feature.

provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. If building is not commenced and
diligently pursued within the time allowed under the original permit or
any extension granted, then the building, development or structure must
be constructed, completed and occupied only in strict compliance with the
standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
§ 300-13.3. Continuation of violations.
Any violation of the previous Zoning Ordinance will continue to be a
violation under this Zoning Ordinance and be subject to penalties and
enforcement under Town and Village Law. If the use, development,
construction or other activity that was a violation under the previous
ordinance complies with the express terms of this Zoning Ordinance,
enforcement action will cease, except to the extent of collecting penalties
for violations that occurred before the effective date specified in § 300-13.1.
The adoption of this Zoning Ordinance does not affect nor prevent any
pending or future prosecution of, or action to abate, violations of the
previous ordinance that occurred before the effective date specified in
§ 300-13.1.
§ 300-13.4. Nonconformities.
Any nonconformity under the previous Zoning Ordinance will also be
nonconformity under this Zoning Ordinance, as long as the situation that
resulted in the nonconforming status under the previous regulation
continues to exist. If, however, a nonconforming situation under previous
zoning regulations becomes conforming because of the adoption of this
Zoning Ordinance, or any subsequent amendment to it, then the situation
§ 300-13.1 STORM SEWERS § 300-13.4
237:693
will no longer be considered a nonconformity. A situation that did not
constitute a nonconforming situation under the previously adopted Zoning
Ordinance does not achieve nonconforming status under this Zoning
Ordinance merely by repeal of the previous Zoning Ordinance.

Commercial Districts
§ 300-21.1. Establishment.
§ 300-21.2. District purposes.
A. The commercial districts are listed below. When this Zoning Ordinance
refers to commercial, central business, office, or C zoning districts, it is
referring to one of the following:
Table 21-1
Commercial Districts
District Name Map Symbol
Neighborhood Commercial NC
Central Business CB
General Commercial GC
Commercial Office CO
B. The district names and map symbols are intended to provide a general
indication of what is allowed in the district by denoting the commercial
or office orientation of the district.
A. Neighborhood Commercial. The purpose of the Neighborhood
Commercial District is to encourage smaller-scaled commercial
development, compatible with the scale and intensity of adjacent
residential and noncommercial sites, and to support the goals and
objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. This district
allows for commercial operations along collector and arterial type
streets offering convenience shopping and services for adjacent
residential areas.
B. Central Business. The purpose of the Central Business District is to
foster a concentration of small-scale, mixed use activity and to support
the goals and objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan.
The CB District is established to maintain and enhance the traditional
mix of retail, office, civic and residential uses within the core of the
Villages. Development in this district should reinforce compact,
pedestrian-oriented development and preservation of traditional
historic character.
C. General Commercial. The purpose of the General Commercial District is
to encourage commercial development and to support the goals and
objectives contained in the Unified Comprehensive Plan. The GC
District is established to provide areas for intensive commercial
activities that primarily depend upon a large volume of vehicular traffic
and serve the daily shopping needs of the community-at-large and
surrounding areas. This district encourages the application of site

design and buffering techniques to mitigate the impacts of commercial
operations and traffic on adjacent uses and the traveling public.
D. Commercial Office. The purpose of the Commercial Office District is to
accommodate office and nonretail activity in a manner that protects and
enhances existing residential neighborhoods. The CO District permits a
mix of residential and office type uses along primary and secondary
thoroughfares that may not be suitable for single-family living due to
increasing traffic volumes. These volumes create an environment
suitable for certain multifamily and office uses that can exist in close
proximity to neighborhoods without adversely affecting the residential
environment.
A. Uses identified with a "P" in Table 21-2 are permitted as-of-right in the
subject zoning district, subject to compliance with all other applicable
standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
B. Uses identified with a "SP" in Table 21-2 may be allowed if reviewed and
approved in accordance with the special permit procedures contained
in Article 66.
C. Uses not listed and those identified with a "-" are expressly prohibited.
D. Other commercial or business uses, except those expressly prohibited,
shall be permitted in the General Commercial and Central Business
Districts under the following circumstances: [Added 12-4-2018 by
L.L. No. 14-2018]
(1) Upon the finding by the Planning Board that such use is of the same
general character as those permitted and will not be detrimental to
the other uses within the district or to the adjoining land uses;
(2) Upon issuance of a special permit pursuant to Article 66; and
(3) Upon issuance of a site plan approval pursuant to Article 63.

without adversely affecting the residential environment. The OO District
permits mixed residential and limited small-scale office-type uses on
properties that are large enough to accommodate sufficient off-street
parking and screening requirements. The preservation and rehabilitation of
sound residential structures while accommodating increased use options is
the primary function of the district. The OO District is to be overlaid upon
the existing residential zoning district.

ARTICLE 54
Landscaping, Screening, and Buffering Regulations
§ 300-54.1. Intent.
The following standards are intended to implement the Town and Villages
long-term planning goals by assuring an acceptable degree of buffering
between land uses, particularly between residential and nonresidential
uses, including agricultural operations, providing a balance between
developed uses and open space, enhancing the visual and aesthetic
appearance of the community and encouraging preservation of existing
natural features. Specifically, these regulations are intended to:
§ 300-54.2. General requirements.
A. Provide natural visual screening of parking areas and along property
boundaries to protect the existing visual quality of adjacent lands.
B. Reduce surface runoff and minimize soil erosion through the natural
filtering capability of landscaped areas.
C. Provide natural buffers that reduce glare and noise, provide wildlife
corridors and protect wildlife habitats, wetlands, stream corridors and
other significant environmental features.
D. Moderate the microclimate of parking areas by providing shade,
absorbing reflected heat from paved surfaces and creating natural wind
breaks.
E. Enhance the overall visual quality of the community by surrounding
developed areas with a variety of plant materials that are consistent
and compatible with the existing natural vegetation of the area.
A. Development activities requiring site plan approval shall submit, as
part of such approval, a landscaping plan in accordance with Article 54
of this chapter. This shall include, but not be limited to, commercial,
retail, industrial, multifamily residential, and institutional uses.
B. Existing site vegetation and unique site features, such as stone walls,
shall be incorporated into landscaping plans to the maximum extent
feasible. Existing healthy trees which are retained shall be credited
against the requirements of these regulations in accordance with their
size and location.
C. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy shall require completion of
lot grading, seeding and required landscaping, or posting of a
performance guaranty acceptable to the Code Enforcement Officer if
the applicant cannot perform the work due to seasonable
impracticalities. In this case, all landscaping work shall be completed
by June 30th of the year following the issuance of the certificate of
occupancy.
§ 300-54.1 STORM SEWERS § 300-54.2
237:771
§ 300-54.3. Landscaping standards.
All plant materials must conform to the most current edition of the
American Nursery and Landscape Association's American Standard for
Nursery Stock (ANSI Z60.1  2004). Applicants are required to design and
install landscaping that shall be tolerant of typical environmental conditions
of this region (USDA Hardiness Zone 5). Proper trees shall be chosen where
any height restrictions (i.e. power lines) exist to minimize conflicts and
improper pruning techniques.
D. All required landscaping shall be of healthy stock and planted
according to accepted horticultural practices. Landscaping plans may
also include a landscape maintenance plan as required in Article 54 to
clearly indicate who is responsible for plant maintenance during the
first 24 months after planting, and a performance guaranty may be
posted for assuring replacement in kinds of plants which die or become
diseased within that time at the Planning Board discretion.
E. All required landscaping shall be maintained in healthy condition by the
property owner. Failure to maintain such landscaping or to replace
dead or diseased landscaping required by this chapter shall constitute a
violation of these regulations.
F. Where existing conditions make compliance with these regulations not
feasible, the Planning Board, at its discretion, may approve planters,
plant boxes or pots containing trees, shrubs and/or flowers to comply
with the intent of these regulations.
G. Trees for screening shall be of species and stock that will provide a
visual screen from the ground up, at least five feet in height. Species
adequate for the Town and Village can be determined by a registered
landscape architect, landscape consultant, or other professionals or
using resources such as the National Arbor Day Foundation or the local
Cornell Cooperative Extension.
H. Trees shall have minimum caliper of two inches at the time of planting.
Shrubs shall have a minimum height of two feet at the time of planting.
I. Pedestrian access to sidewalks or buildings should be considered in the
design of all landscaped areas.
A. Perimeter landscaping. Landscaping shall be required along the
perimeter of projects, or within the required setbacks, and shall be
provided except where driveways or other openings may be required.
The Planning Board may consider alternatives to the location of
landscaping materials, based on the existing character of the
neighborhood. For large development projects such as shopping
centers, perimeter landscaping shall apply to the full perimeter of the
project, and not to internal property lines. The linear feet guidelines
below are to be used to calculate the number of required plantings; they
do not require that plantings be uniformly spaced. Rather, grouping of
§ 300-54.2 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 300-54.3
237:772
plants consistent with accepted landscape practice is encouraged.
Specific requirements are as follows:
(1) At least one tree for each 40 linear feet of the perimeter of the lot;
and
(2) At least one shrub for each 10 linear feet of the perimeter of the
lot.
B. Parking areas. Parking lots containing 20 or more spaces shall be
internally landscaped so as to provide shade and screening and in order
to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of traffic. The area
designated as required setbacks shall not be included as part of the
required landscaping. Plantings shall be spaced and grouped consistent
with accepted nursery standards, and shall not be located in a manner
that impedes driver visibility. Specific requirements are as follows:
(1) A landscaped buffer at least 10 feet in width must be provided
between a parking lot and the public rights-of-way. In traditional
village settings, this distance may be reduced to be consistent with
existing setbacks;
(2) Shade trees shall be planted along the frontage, parallel to the
frontage road with a spacing not to exceed 40 feet or consistent
with existing tree spacing on neighboring lots when present;
(3) A minimum of one landscaped island, at least 200 square feet in
size, shall be provided for every 20 parking spaces contained within
each single row of parking. Islands shall be planted with trees and
shrubs with a minimum of one tree per 20 parking spaces;
(4) End islands shall be required for all parking configurations entirely
surrounded by drive aisles, provided that such configurations
contain more than five spaces in a single row and 10 spaces in a

This regulation shall apply to all new outdoor lighting fixtures, the
expansion and alteration of existing fixtures, as well as the replacement of
lighting fixtures; except any repair or maintenance.
§ 300-55.3. Approvals required.
For uses which require a site plan review, the Planning Board may require
a lighting site plan to be submitted showing the location, number, type/
style, mounting height, and lighting levels produced on the ground (i.e.,
photometric report). All other uses shall conform to the general
requirements contained herein.
§ 300-55.4. General requirements/standards.
§ 300-55.5. Specific requirements/standards.
A. All outdoor lighting fixtures shall be shielded or otherwise contained on
the property from which it originates (known as "light trespass
limitations").
B. Exterior lighting fixtures on commercial, industrial, institutional, and
multifamily properties shall conform to the Illuminating Engineer
Society of North America (IESNA) criteria for full cutoff fixtures. In
addition, the lighting levels shall be designed to meet the minimum
requirements of the latest recommended levels set forth by IESNA.
Where no standard from IESNA exists, the Planning Board shall
determine the appropriate level, taking into account levels for the
closest IESNA activity.

sufficient impact resistance at the pedestrian level to withstand normal
wear.
D. No more than three exterior building materials shall be used on any one
side of a building.
E. Changes in materials shall occur at inside corners. Material changes at
the outside corners or in a plane shall be avoided.
F. On corner lots, the primary facade of commercial buildings shall be
oriented to face the principal street rather than side streets.
G. The front facade and main entrance shall face a public street and shall
have a direct pedestrian connection to the street.
A. Use similar building setback.
B. Use similar building height.
C. Use similar roof form.
D. Use similar exterior materials.
E. Mitigate the larger mass of commercial buildings with facade
articulation.
F. Provide green/open space.
(1) Use small green spaces, courts, squares, parks, plazas, and similar
spaces.
(2) Use existing natural features as transitions, including natural
differences in topography (not retaining walls), streams, existing

and aesthetic quality of the Town and Villages, and increase the capability
of the Zoning Ordinance to adapt to a variety of unique circumstances.
§ 300-63.2. Applicability.
In accordance with New York State Town and Village Law, no construction
or site improvement work may commence until site plan approval, where

following and shall be exempt from the procedures outlined in
§ 300-63.3:
(a) Altering the location of any one structure or group of

occupancy issued for any parking area and the building or use served
thereby, where the number of spaces has been waived, shall be deemed
conditional upon the possible requirement for the future development
of the additional off-street parking upon such order by the Planning
Department. Failure to comply with such order within the time fixed
thereby shall constitute a violation of this article.
B. Review by Planning Board. The Planning Board may, at its discretion,
reduce the required number of parking spaces by up to 25% upon
determination that the applicant can demonstrate that the site can
support the required number of spaces, should the need arise in the
future. If the Planning Board determines that waived parking, paving
and striping are needed to provide necessary off-street parking, it may
order the installation thereof. Any certificate of occupancy issued for
any parking area and the building or use served thereby, where the
number of spaces has been waived, shall be deemed conditional upon
the possible requirement for the future development of the additional
off-street parking upon such order by the Planning Board. Failure to
comply with such order within the time fixed thereby shall constitute a
violation of this article.
A. Appeal of Planning Department decision. An applicant for a minor site
plan review or any other aggrieved party may appeal to the Planning
Board for a review and modification of a decision made by the Planning
Department. Such appeal shall be treated by the Planning Board in the
same manner as a major site plan review and follow the provisions of
§ 300-63.3 of this chapter.
B. Appeal of a Planning Board decision. Any person or persons, jointly or
severally aggrieved by any decision of the Planning Board of the Village

ARTICLE 64
Nonconforming Uses
§ 300-64.1. Purpose.
Within the districts established by this chapter or amendments, there exist
lots, buildings, uses of land and characteristics of use which were lawful
before this chapter or amendments were passed but which would be
prohibited, regulated or restricted under terms of this chapter or future
amendments. Regulations for the continuance, maintenance, repair,
restoration and discontinuance of nonconforming lots, buildings, land and
uses are established for the following purposes:
§ 300-64.2. Exceptions.
Normal maintenance and repair, structural alteration in and reconstruction
or enlargement of a building with nonconforming bulk are permitted, as
well as new construction on the lot, if the same does not increase the degree
of or create any new nonconforming bulk in such building.
§ 300-64.3. General provisions.
A. To permit these nonconformities to continue, but to minimize any
adverse effect on adjoining properties and development.
B. To regulate their maintenance and repair.
C. To restrict their rebuilding if substantially destroyed.
D. To require their permanent discontinuance if not operated for certain
periods.
E. To require conformity if they are discontinued, and to bring about the
eventual compliance with the objectives of the Future Land Use Plan
and this chapter.
A. Repair and alteration. Normal maintenance and repair of and incidental
alteration to a building occupied by a nonconforming use are permitted
if they do not extend the nonconforming use. No structural alteration or
enlargement shall be made in a building occupied by a nonconforming
use, except where required by law, i.e., court ordered, or to adapt a
building to a conforming use or to any other use permitted under
Subsection B or in a building occupied by a nonconforming use
permitted to extend under Subsection C.
B. Change of use. A nonconforming use may not be changed to a more
intensive nonconforming use nor shall a conforming use be changed to
a nonconforming use. Any nonconforming use when changed to a
conforming use shall not thereafter be changed back to a
nonconforming use. A nonconforming use, building or structure shall
not be enlarged except upon the issuance of a variance from the Zoning
Board of Appeals.
§ 300-64.1 STORM SEWERS § 300-64.3
237:811
C. Extension or enlargement of nonconforming use. Extension or
enlargement shall mean:
(1) The enlargement of such building so as to create additional floor
space.
(2) The extension within any existing building to any portion of the
floor area not formerly used for such nonconforming use, except
where such additional floor area was manifestly designed for such
use at the time such use became nonconforming.
(3) The extension of the use to any area outside of the building.
(4) In the case of a nonconforming, nonbuilding land use, the use of
any additional land on which no substantial operations were
previously conducted, provided that any such extension or
enlargement is on the same lot occupied by the nonconforming use
on the effective date of this chapter.
(5) To the extent the district bulk requirements permit, upon the
approval of the Zoning Board of Appeals, a nonconforming use may
be extended to, but not exceed, an increase of 50% of its floor area
or of its land area occupancy of a nonbuilding use. However, this
provision may be used only once for each such use and in no event
may be applied to signs or to increase the number of units in a
multifamily building.
(6) An accessory building(s) to a legally existing nonconforming
residential use, in a nonresidential zoning district, is permitted by
right, provided that the accessory building(s) meets the minimum
side/rear yard requirement for the district in which the property is
located and provided that the accessory building complies with all
other requirements for such buildings.
D. Damage and destruction. If a building is damaged to the extent of 50%
or more of its assessed valuation, excluding the full value of the land, as
determined by the Town Assessor, such building may be repaired,
provided that substantial work is undertaken within one year after such
damage; otherwise, such building shall thereafter be occupied only by a
conforming use and structure. This provision shall not prevent the
repair of a nonconforming building damaged to the extent of less than
50% of its assessed value. [Amended 5-20-2014 by L.L. No. 5-2014]
E. Discontinuance or abandoning of use. A nonconforming use or building
discontinued or abandoned for 12 consecutive months shall not,
thereafter, be used or occupied except in conformance with the
regulations of the district in which it is located. Discontinuance of the
active and continuous operation of a nonconforming use, or a part or
portion thereof, for a period of 12 consecutive months is hereby
construed and considered to be an abandonment of such
nonconforming use, regardless of any reservation of intent not to
abandon same or of intent to resume active operations. Actual
§ 300-64.3 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 300-64.3
237:812
abandonment is evidenced by the removal of buildings, structures,
machinery, equipment and other evidence of such nonconforming use
of the land and premises.
F. Nonconforming parking, loading, and stacking facilities. A building, use
or occupancy lawfully existing at the time this chapter or any
amendment thereto becomes effective, but which does not conform to
the off-street parking, loading and stacking requirements, may be
occupied or continued without such facilities being provided. Any such
spaces that may be provided thereafter shall comply with the
requirements of Article 51. If an existing building, use or occupancy is
altered so that there is an increase in the number of dwelling units,
seating capacity, employees or floor area, or if the use is changed to one
requiring more off-street parking, loading and stacking spaces, the
number of such spaces shall be provided at least equal to the number
required for the increased area of the building or use in accordance
with all provisions of Article 51.
G. Nonconforming lots. No parcel or lot, after the adoption of this chapter
or amendment thereto, shall be used or divided in a manner which
prevents or diminishes compliance with the requirements established
by this chapter or amendments thereto. Lots subdivided prior to the
adoption of this chapter or any amendment and not meeting the
minimum lot size requirements may be built upon, provided that the
bulk requirements for any use within the district are met except as
provided in this chapter.

Planned Unit Development District (PUD)
§ 300-65.1. Purpose.
The Planned Unit Development (PUD) Zoning District allows for an
alternative process to develop a unified and integrated development plan
in the Town or Villages. PUD Zoning Districts promote flexible development
opportunities that would not otherwise be possible through the strict
application of the land use and development regulations of this chapter, and
allow diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the relationship
of uses, structures, and open spaces. The PUD District results in a cohesive
and unified project based on unique standards and regulations developed
for a particular site or sites. Planned Unit Development Districts shall
achieve the following objectives:
§ 300-65.2. Location.
The Planned Unit Development District shall be applicable to any area
of the Town or Villages where the applicant can demonstrate that the
characteristics of the development will satisfy the intent and objectives of
this chapter. Where a PUD District is deemed appropriate, the rezoning
of land to a Planned Unit Development District will replace all uses and
dimensional specifications contained elsewhere in this chapter. The PUD
District shall be defined as all contiguous parcels zoned PUD including
associated streets or rights-of-way. A planned unit development plan must
be reviewed and approved on an individual basis, separately from
neighboring planned unit developments.
A. An alternative development pattern in harmony with the objectives of
various Town, Village and regional land use and development plans.
B. A creative use of land and related physical development allowing an
orderly transition from one land use to another.
C. Diversification in the uses permitted and variation in the relationship of
uses, structures, open spaces and height of structures in developments
conceived as cohesive unified projects.
D. Unique standards for site and building design.
E. The preservation and enhancement of desirable site characteristics,
such as open space, natural topography, vegetation and geologic
features and the prevention of soil erosion.
F. To encourage a more efficient and economical arrangement of land
uses, buildings, circulation system and utilities, resulting in a smaller
network of utilities and streets and a lessened burden of traffic on
streets and highways.
§ 300-65.1 STORM SEWERS § 300-65.3
237:815
§ 300-65.3. District ownership.
All owners of the parcel or parcels included in the planned unit development
plan (PUD plan) shall be included as joint applicants on the initial PUD
application.
§ 300-65.4. Area requirements.
A. No Planned Unit Development District shall be established having an
area of less than 10 contiguous acres within the Town or two contiguous
acres within the Villages.
B. Open space requirements for individual PUD plans.
(1) Not less than 25% of the total area shall be set aside for common
open space. In general, open space shall achieve the following:
(a) Protect and preserve floodplains, wetlands, steep slopes, or
watercourses, etc.
(b) Protect any historic, archeological or cultural resources listed
on the national, state, county, or local historical registers.
(c) Protect any mature woodlands, meadows, or ecologically
sensitive areas for wildlife habitat.
(d) Provide an upland buffer area adjacent to any streams,
wetlands, or surface water to protect native species
vegetation.
(e) Landscape common areas such as islands and new streets.
(f) Open space intended for recreation or public use shall be so
located to be accessible to pedestrians.
(g) The suitability of open space for recreational or public use
shall be determined by its visibility from a significant number
of units or length or number of public or private streets.
(2) Disposition requirements.
(a) Ownership shall be held by the developer(s), or in corporate
ownership by the owners of the lots or dwelling units within
the development, if the open space is reserved for private use.
(b) Such common open space shall be set aside as a deed
restriction for a specific period of time or conservation
easement in perpetual ownership. The maintenance of
common open space and recreation areas and maintenance
and replacement of approved landscaping shall be guaranteed
in a form approved by the Municipal Attorney.
(c) Lands dedicated as open space, park, or recreation shall be
noted on the plat map, deed description filed and referenced.

Chapter 171, Erosion and Sediment Control of the Town Code,
Chapter 238 of Johnson City's Code and Chapter 213 of
Endicott's Code.
(4) Engineering feasibility studies of any anticipated problems, which
might arise due to the proposed development, shall be submitted if
requested by the Planning Board.
A. Purpose. The provisions of this section establish special procedures for
amending this chapter to permit the mapping of Planned Unit
Development Districts. The procedures herein established are intended
to substitute procedural protections for substantive regulations in
recognition of the fact that traditional density, bulk, spacing and use
regulations, which may be useful in protecting the character of
substantially developed and stable areas, may impose inappropriate
preregulations and rigidities upon the development or redevelopment
of parcels or areas which lend themselves to an individual, planned
approach.
B. Authority. The Zoning Map may be amended from time to time, by local
law duly enacted by the governing body, to provide for Planned Unit
Development Districts; provided, however, that no such amendment
shall be enacted except in accordance with procedures herein
established and the applicable standards and regulations established by
Article 63, Site Plan Review, and Chapter 181, Subdivision of Land, in
the Town's Code and Chapter 244, Subdivision of Land, in the Johnson
City Code.
C. General overview of procedure. The following outlines the process
required to obtain approval for a Planned Unit Development District in
the Town or Village. In general, the process includes the following
steps; additional information on each step is outlined in this section.
(1) Step 1: conceptual development plan approval (optional). The
applicant submits a conceptual development plan and discusses the
information on an informal basis with the Planning Director, Code
Enforcement Officer, and Municipal Engineer. Following the review
of the concept plan, the Planning Director has the discretion to
present the concept plan to the Planning Board and governing body
for comment.
(2) Step 2: preliminary development plan approval. The applicant
submits a preliminary development plan to the Planning Board
(along with a rezoning application to the governing body) for an
advisory opinion. The plans are transmitted to the governing body
for approval or denial of the rezoning and preliminary plan
following a public hearing by the governing body, if applicable.
§ 300-65.7 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 300-65.8
237:822
(3) Step 3: final development plan review. The applicant incorporates
conditions into plans for final development site plan or subdivision
plat review by the Planning Board. If the plans are in substantial
conformity, final approval is granted.
D. Procedure.
(1) Conceptual development plan approval (optional). The applicant
has the option to discuss the proposal with the Planning
Department by submitting a conceptual development plan. The
following outlines the conceptual development plan approval
process.
(a) The plan should include the following information: proposed
uses, vehicular and pedestrian circulation system, building
placement, existing and proposed utilities, drainage and
proposed private and public open space.
(b) The plan will be reviewed by the Planning, Code Enforcement
and Engineering Departments, as appropriate, which may
meet jointly to discuss the project.
(c) The conceptual plan review may be placed on the Planning
Board's agenda at its regularly scheduled meeting to discuss
the review process and offer recommendations for the plan.
(d) The applicant may, at its option, submit the preliminary
development plan in lieu of a less-detailed conceptual
development plan with the submission of the Planned Unit
Development District rezoning application and planned unit
development plan application. In such case, the applicant shall
comply with all provisions of this chapter applicable to
submission of the preliminary development plan and to
submission of the final development plan.
(e) The Planning Department and Planning Board may offer
recommendations and suggestions on potential issues and
alterations that should be considered by the applicant. The
applicant can use this information in preparing the preliminary
development plan as part of the application process.
(2) Preliminary development plan review. The preliminary
development plan offers the applicant the opportunity to provide
preliminary details to the Planning Department and Planning Board
on the design and layout of the project. By providing the
preliminary site layout, circulation patterns, densities, setbacks
and other proposed regulations, the applicant will have the
opportunity to discuss and amend the preliminary development
plan before finalizing the PUD plan.
(a) Submission of preliminary development plan.
§ 300-65.8 STORM SEWERS § 300-65.8
237:823
[1] The applicant shall submit 15 sets of preliminary
professional drawings/plans, the PUD application form,
the rezoning petition form, the long EAF, the project
narrative, and the application fee as defined under Code to
the Planning Department.
[2] The Planning Department will refer the PUD/rezoning
application to:
[a] The Planning Board for its advisory opinion, and
[b] The Town/Village Board. The Town/Village Board
shall:
[i] Declare lead agency for the rezoning.
[ii] Refer the application back to the Planning
Department to commence the 239 review, if
required, and distribute the plans and application
to other interested agencies, including
Engineering, Water Department, Fire
Department, and Code Enforcement. (At this time,
the Planning Department may ask for additional
copies of the plans, as justified and needed for
review by other interested agencies.)
[3] If the development requires the subdivision of land or
installation of public streets and/or utilities, an application
for subdivision approval can be made. The preliminary
development plans shall be subject to the applicable
sections under Chapter 181, Subdivision of Land, in the
Town Code and Chapter 244, Subdivision of Land, in the
Johnson City Code.
[4] The review procedures for rezoning, PUD and site plan/
subdivision plat can run concurrently, with the applicant
acknowledging that the property is still subject to rezoning
approval.
(b) Action by Planning Board.
[1] The Planning Board shall review and study the preliminary
development plan and consider the comments of other
agencies.
[2] Within 60 days of receiving the preliminary development
plan application, the Planning Board shall make its
recommendations on the preliminary development plan.
The recommendation can include one of the following:
[a] Approve the plans as submitted.
§ 300-65.8 JOHNSON CITY CODE § 300-65.8
237:824
[b] Approve the preliminary plans with conditions. The
Planning Board may impose changes or conditions,
which shall be incorporated into the final plans.

the preliminary PUD plans, the Planning Board shall
state its reasons for opposition in writing.
[3] The failure of the Planning Board to act within 60 days, or
such longer period as may be agreed to by the applicant,
shall be deemed a recommendation for the approval of the
preliminary development plan as submitted.
[4] The Planning Board shall transmit its recommendation to
the governing body for consideration in the rezoning
application made as part of the preliminary development
plan application for the property.
(c) Action by governing body.
[1] The governing body shall follow regulations under SEQRA.
[a] Make a SEQR determination of type of action (if Type

[b] If EIS is not required, call for a public hearing to be
held following the thirty-day review period. (The
Planning Department will prepare public notices for
paper and sign posting to be posted a minimum of 10
days prior to hearing, and will prepare Part II of EAF.)

uses and buildings, the relationship to the topography of
the land, other factors, such as vegetation, wetlands,
floodplains, sewage disposal, drainage, water needs, trip
generation, recreation/open space areas and such
concerns as may be appropriate.
[3] Following the thirty-day 239 review period, if required,
and receipt by the governing body of the report of the
Planning Board, or its failure to act as above provided, the
governing body shall conduct a public hearing on the
preliminary development plan and rezoning application.
[4] Within 30 days of conclusion of the public hearing, the

incorporates the specific conditions outlined during the preliminary
development plan approval process. Inclusion of the approval
conditions will allow the project to move forward in a timely
manner; the application process includes a mechanism to
streamline the approval so the project can move forward.
(a) All final development plan approvals shall require site plan
approval as set forth in Article 63, Site Plan Review, of this

(b) If the Planning Board finds substantial conformity and finds the
final development plan to be in all other respects complete and
in compliance with any conditions imposed by approval of the
preliminary development plan, the Planning Board shall
approve the final development plan. A final development plan
shall be deemed not to be in substantial conformity with an
approved preliminary development plan if it:

lot coverage, yard requirements or changes in land use
percentages (besides arrangement of land use), approved
for the preliminary Planned Unit Development plan;

development plan; or
[8] Exceeds the maximum density for residential uses, as
approved on the preliminary plan, and the maximum floor
area ratio for nonresidential uses.
(c) Any changes to the proposed phasing plan submitted with the
preliminary plan shall be submitted with the final development
plan.
(d) If expressly authorized by the approval of the final
development plan, the applicant may, pursuant to and subject
to the limitations of the applicable codes and ordinances of the
Town, apply for and receive building permits for model
buildings, residential or commercial, that would be used for
the express purpose of showing typical structures to be
developed in the PUD. These buildings can only be constructed

development of an approved PUD, the Planning Department may
authorize minor adjustments to the final development plan when such
adjustments appear necessary in light of technical or engineering
considerations first discovered during actual development. Such minor
adjustments shall be limited to the following:
(1) Altering the location of any one structure or group of structures by
not more than 10 feet or 0.1 of the distance shown on the final
development plan between such structure or structures and any
other structure or any vehicular circulation element or any
boundary of the Planned Unit Development District, whichever is
less.
(2) Altering the location of any circulation element by not more than 10
feet or 0.1 of the distance shown on the final development plan
between such circulation element or any structure, whichever is
less.
(3) Altering the boundary of any open space (other than dedicated
open space) by not more than 50 feet, provided that the total
amount of open space is not reduced by more than 5%.
(4) Reducing the yard area or open space associated with any single
structure by not more than 5%.
(5) Altering any final grade by not more than 5% of the originally
planned grade.
B. Amendments to final development plan. In addition to the adjustments
authorized by the Planning Department, an approved final development
plan may be amended or varied by submitting a new site plan to the
Planning Board. The process for final development plan approval shall
be followed for all amendments.
C. Approval revoked. The following changes to an approved Planned Unit
Development District are considered significant, and any approval of
the PUD District shall be revoked and the approval process begun
again. Revisions for which this shall apply include:

cause the required number of parking spaces to increase by 15% or
more or will cause any change in the SEQR determination.

or a change of housing type, even though the density may not
increase. Changes in the tenure shall not be considered a
significant change.
A. Within one year after the approval of a final development plan, or such
other time as may be established by the approved development
schedule, construction shall commence in accordance with such
approved plan.
B. Failure to commence construction within such period shall, unless an
extension shall have been granted, automatically render void the final
development plan approval and all permits based on such approvals. In
addition, such documents shall require time expiration and reverter
language to remedy nonperformance.
A. If the Building Official finds that development is not proceeding in
accordance with the approved schedule, or that it fails in any other
respect to comply with the final development plan as finally approved,
he/she shall immediately notify the governing body of such fact and
issue an order stopping any or all work on the Planned Unit
Development District until such time as any noncompliance is cured.
B. Within 60 days of such notice, the governing body shall either:
(1) Revoke, by local law, the final development plan approval and
direct the Building Official to initiate appropriate amendment
procedures to return the affected area of the Planned Unit
Development District to an appropriate zoning classification;
(2) Take such steps as it shall deem necessary to compel compliance
with the final development plan as approved; or
