hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the City of St. Marys, Ohio.
   SECTION 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect from and

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.
COMPARATIVE SECTION TABLE
   EDITOR'S NOTE: Source material for the Codified Ordinances of St. Marys was
either ordinances or resolutions enacted by Council, or new matter ordained by
the Adopting Ordinance. Sections of the Codified Ordinances without any history
indicate that such sections contain new matter ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance. In the following table, the disposition of all source material in
the St. Marys Codified Ordinances is indicated.

   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment

a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance

designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action

number, the words govern.

   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the

provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)

irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.

expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an

(Ord. 88-70. Passed 10- 10-88. )
   163.03  REGULATIONS.
   The following shall be enacted as the "Tree Code" of the City of St. Marys:
   (a)    (1)    "Street trees" mean trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody
vegetation on land lying between property lines on either side of all streets,
avenues, or ways within the City.
      (2)    "Park trees" mean trees, shrubs, bushes, and all other woody
vegetation having individual names found in public parks or to which the public
has free access as a park.
   (b)    The Commission shall have the power to promulgate a list of what
constitutes the official street tree species, size and class for the City. No
species, size or class other than those included in the list may be planted as
street trees without written permission of the City Tree Commission. This list
shall be reviewed and updated annually by the Tree Commission.
   (c)    The spacing of street trees will be in accordance with the tree
species, size and class referred to in subsection (b) hereof and no trees may
be planted closer together than the following: small trees, thirty feet; medium
trees, forty feet; and large trees, fifty feet, except in special plantings
designed and approved by the Tree Commission.
   (d)    The distance trees may be planted from curbs or curblines and
sidewalks will be in accordance with the tree species, size, and class referred
to in subsection (b) hereof, and no trees may be planted closer to any curb or
sidewalk than the following: small trees, two feet; medium trees, three feet;
and large trees, four feet.
   (e)    No street trees shall be planted closer than thirty-five feet from
any street corner measured from the point of nearest intersecting curb or
curblines. No street tree shall be planted within ten feet of any fire hydrant.
   (f)    No street trees other than those species referred to as small trees
in subsection (b) hereof may be planted under or within ten lateral feet of any
overhead utility wire or over or within five lateral feet of any underground
water line, sewer line, distribution lines, or other utility. A public utility
company shall obtain the written approval of the Tree Commission or its
authorized City representative for any pruning project undertaken for the
clearing of electrical or telephone lines.
   (g)    The City shall reserve the right to prune, maintain and remove trees,
plants and shrubs within the lines of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes,
squares and public grounds, as may be necessary to insure public safety.
   (h)    The Tree Commission shall reserve the right to cause or order to
plant, prune, maintain and remove trees, plants, and shrubs, within the lines
of all streets, alleys, avenues, lanes, squares and public grounds as may be
necessary to insure public safety or to preserve or enhance the symmetry and
beauty of such public grounds.
   (i)    The City Tree Commission may remove or cause or order to be removed
any tree or part thereof which is in an unsafe condition or which by reason of
its nature is injurious to sewers, electric power lines, gas lines, water
lines, or other public improvements, or is affected with an injurious fungus,
insect or other pest. This section does not prohibit the planting of street
trees by adjacent property owners providing that the selection and location of
the trees is in accordance with subsections (c) to (f) hereof.
   (j)   All ash trees must be inspected by crew foremen for Emerald Ash Borer
(EAB) prior to chipping, grinding, slabbing, or moving any wood from said tree
off-site.  Crown of tree must be inspected for D-shaped exit holes and bark
splitting.  Bark must also be removed with hammer and chisel, sharp knife, or
drawknife to inspect for EAB galleries.  If, in the event that exit holes,
larvae, pupae, adults, or galleries are found, a crew foreman must contact
designated municipal representative immediately.  If tree appears to be
positive for EAB, a municipal representative will then proceed by contacting
the Ohio Department of Agriculture’s EAB Division immediately.  All work must
cease until a said municipal representative authorizes that work continue.
   (k)    It shall be unlawful as a normal practice for any person, firm or
City department to top any street tree, park tree or other tree on public
property unless permission is granted by the Tree Commission. Topping is
defined as the severe cutting back of limbs to stubs larger than three inches
in diameter within the tree's crown to such a degree so as to remove the normal
canopy and disfigure the tree. Trees severely damaged by storm or other causes,
or certain trees under utility wires or other obstructions where other pruning
practices are not practical may be exempted from this ordinance at the
determination of the City Tree Commission or its authorized representative.
   (l)    Every owner of any tree overhanging any street or right-of-way within
the City shall prune the branches of such tree or trees so that such branches
shall not obstruct the light from any street lamp or obstruct the view of any
street intersection so that there shall be a clear space of eight feet above
the surface of the street or sidewalk. The owners shall remove all dead,
diseased or dangerous trees or broken or decayed limbs which constitute a
menace to the safety of the public. The City shall have the right to prune any
tree or shrub on private property when it interferes with the proper spread of
light along the street from a street light or interferes with the visibility of
any traffic control device or sign or interferes with actions of City vehicles
through alleyways. The cost of such trimming performed by the City or its
contractors may be charged to the abutting property owner.
   (m)    The City Tree Commission shall have the right to cause the removal of
any dead or diseased trees on private property within the City, when such trees
constitute a hazard to life and property or harbor insects or disease which
constitute a potential threat to other trees within the City. The City Tree
Commission will notify in writing the owner of such trees to be removed.
Removal shall be done by the owners at their own expense within thirty days
after the date of service of the notice of removal. In the event of failure of
owners to comply with such provisions, the City shall have the authority to
remove such trees and certify cost of removal on the owner's property tax.
   (n)    All stumps of street and park trees shall be removed below the
surface of the ground a minimum of twelve inches to facilitate landscaping.
These stumps will be removed through a stump removal program conducted annually
by the City.
   (o)    It shall be unlawful for any person to prevent, delay or interfere
with the City Tree Commission or any of its agents while engaging in and about

   181.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   Each person who is subject to the tax imposed by this chapter shall
file a return under the following provisions and setting forth:
      (1)   Each taxpayer, except as herein provided, shall, whether or not a
tax be due thereon, make and file a return on or before April 15 of the year
following the effective date of this section, and on or before April 15 of each
year thereafter.  When the return is made for a fiscal year or other period
different from the calendar year, the return shall be filed by the fifteenth
(15th) day of the fourth month following the end of such fiscal year or
period.  The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to provide, by regulation,
that the return of an employer or employers, showing the amount of City tax
deducted by said employer or employers from the qualifying wages, bonuses,
payments, commissions or other compensation of a nonresident employee, and paid
by him or them to the Tax Commissioner, shall be accepted as the return
required of any nonresident employee whose sole income, subject to tax under
this section, is such qualifying wages, salaries, bonus payments, commissions,
or other compensation.  No taxpayer shall be required to file a return if they
have not attained the age of 16 years at the end of the year.  The Tax
Commissioner shall provide, by regulation, relief from the annual filing
requirement to certain retired individuals who no longer are expected to have
income taxable to the City of St. Marys.
      (2)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter; and
      (3)   Such other pertinent statements, information, returns, or other
information returns or information as the Tax Commissioner requires, including
a statement that the figures used in the return are the figures used in the
return for the federal income tax, adjusted to set forth only such income as is
taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
         (Ord. 2012-22.  Passed 6-25-12.)
   (b)   A taxpayer on a fiscal year accounting basis for federal tax purposes
shall, beginning with said taxpayer’s first fiscal year any part of which falls
within the tax period, pay the tax on the basis of said taxpayer’s fiscal year
and shall file annual returns by the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth (4th)
month following the end of the fiscal year or period.
   (c)   Any taxpayer that has requested an extension for filing a federal
income tax return may request an extension for the filing of the St. Marys
Income Tax Return by filing a copy of the taxpayer’s federal extension request
with the Department of Taxation.  Any taxpayer not required to file a federal
income tax return may request an extension for filing a St. Marys Income Tax
Return in writing.  The request for extension must be filed on or before the
original due date for the annual return.  If the request is granted, the
extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the last day of
the month following the month to which the due date of the federal income tax
return has been extended.  The Tax Commissioner may deny a taxpayer’s request
for an extension if the taxpayer fails to timely file the request; or fails to
file a copy of the federal extension request; or owes the City any delinquent
income tax, penalty, or interest; or has failed to file any required income tax
return, report, or other related document for a prior tax period.
   (d)   The taxpayer making such return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the City the amount of taxes shown as due thereon; provided,
however, that where any portion of the tax so due shall have been deducted at
the source, pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.06, or where any portion of the tax shall have been paid by the taxpayer,
pursuant to the provisions of Section
181.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the return.  Should it then appear that the taxpayer has paid more than
the amount of tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of this
chapter, such overpayment shall be refunded, or at option of the taxpayer,
credited to said taxpayer’s next year’s tax liability; provided however, that
no additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be
collected or refunded.  Within three months from the final determination of any
federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s City tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to
the City tax based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and
pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any
overpayment.
   (e)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to accept the return of a
resident employer or employers, showing the total of the amount of tax deducted
by such employer, or employers, from the qualifying, wages, commissions, or
other compensation of employees, and the Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized
to accept the return of a resident paid by said taxpayer or taxpayers to the
City Income Tax Department as the return required of any employee whose sole
income, subject to the tax or taxes under this chapter, is such salary, wages,
commissions, or other compensation.
   (f)   A corporation, if that affiliated group of corporations filed a
consolidated return with the Internal Revenue Service pursuant to Section 1501
of the Internal Revenue Code.
   (g)   An adjustment made to a tax return by the Department of Taxation,
after the return has been filed in good faith by the taxpayer, will not be made
by the Department if the result of the adjustment is equal to or less than five
dollars ($5.00) as underpayment or overpayment of tax. 
(Ord. 2004-02.  Passed 2-23-04.)
   181.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City who employs one
or more persons on a salary, wage, commission, or other compensation basis,
shall, at the time of payment thereof, deduct therefrom one and one-half
percent (1.5%) of the qualifying wages, commission, or other compensation due
from the employer to the employee.  On or before the last day of each month
following the close of the calendar quarter, a return must be filed and payment
made to the City Income Tax Department covering the previous quarter’s
liability.  An employer who withholds one thousand two hundred dollars ($1,200)
or more per year must, before the 20th of each following month, pay the taxes
so withheld to the Income Tax Department on a monthly basis.  Such return shall
be on a form prescribed by or acceptable to the Income Tax Department and shall
be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed by the City.
   The Tax Commissioner is authorized to enter into agreement with employers
outside the City, provided they have the written consent of the employees
affected, to collect such taxes at the source in the same manner as provided
herein.
   (b)   Such employer in collecting the tax shall be deemed to hold the same
until payment is made by such employer to the City as a trustee for the benefit
of the City, and any such tax collected by such employers shall, until the same
is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (c)   However, no person shall be required to withhold the tax on the wages
or other compensation paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about
such person’s residence.
(Ord. 2004-02.  Passed 2-23-04.)
   181.07  DECLARATIONS.

to the provisions of Section
181.06, or who engages in any business, shall file a declaration setting forth
such estimated income or the estimated profit or loss from such business during
the year covered by the declaration, together with the estimated tax due
thereon, if any.

obtainable upon request from, the Income Tax Department, which form or forms
may contain a statement that the figures used in making such declaration are
the figures used in making the declaration of the estimate for federal income
tax, adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the provisions
of this chapter.
   (d)   Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid to the City shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least 22.5% of the estimated tax.
   Exclusive of taxpayers filing on a fiscal year basis, at least a similar
amount shall be paid on or before July 31, October 31, and January 31 of each
year.  Such estimate may be amended at any time.  A taxpayer reporting on a
fiscal year basis shall file, beginning with Taxpayer’s first fiscal year any
part of which falls within the tax period, a declaration on or before the
fifteenth day of the fourth month of the taxpayer’s taxable year accompanied by
a payment of at least 22.5% of the estimated tax shown due thereon.  At least a
similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month,

nonpayment of estimated tax liability if the taxpayer has remitted an amount at
least equal to one hundred percent of the taxpayer’s tax liability for the
preceding year, provided that the return for the preceding year reflected a
twelve month period and the taxpayer filed a return for the preceding year; or,
if the taxpayer, which is an individual, was not domiciled within the City of
St. Marys on the first day of January of the current calendar year.

shall send to the taxpayer by certified mail a written statement showing the
amount of tax so fixed together with the interest and penalties thereon, if
any.

      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for
all or part of a taxable year if the individual was domiciled in the
Municipality on the last day of the immediately preceding taxable year or if
the tax administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.
      (3)   An individual may rebut the presumption of domicile described in
division (A)(1) of this section if the individual establishes by a
preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Municipality  for all or part of the taxable year.
   (B)    For the purpose of determining whether an individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of a taxable year, factors that may be
considered include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)    The individual's domicile in other taxable years;
      (2)    The location at which the individual is registered to vote;
      (3)    The address on the individual's driver's license;

consecutive days in the Municipality.  For purposes of this section, the
State's contact period test or bright-line test and resulting determination
have no bearing on municipal residency or domicile.

doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
187.052 of this Chapter or division (D) or (F) of this section.  An employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from
qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (A)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (B)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld

to make payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         (b)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars. Payment under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be made
so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen
days after the last day of each month.
         (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section
187.091 of this Chapter.
         (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not
required to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
         (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by
the failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold
the tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
            (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (C)    Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (D)    Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (E)    On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.

other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (G)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (H)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal

employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal

in Section
187.051 of this Chapter.

professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

         (e)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   
   (C)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)

qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
187.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)   Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the

corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from

sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
         (c)   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the

which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.

real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in

commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation

agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
187.081 of this Chapter.
   (G)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under divisions (11)(L) and (34)(A)(iv) of Section
187.03 of this Chapter, by a municipal corporation to which the taxpayer has
apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer shall add the amount that
is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to
that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were
the amount related to the stock option not exempted from taxation. This
division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment to the amount
of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal corporation
under this section.

income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to that taxable

the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under federal law.

Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last

municipal income tax.
   (C)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

income" for "federal taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears
in that division and by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for
"a C corporation's" wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under division (1) of
187.03 of this Chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one
of the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss
for that taxable year:
         (a)   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty per cent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
187.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (F)    Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall
make the computations required under Section
187.062 of this Chapter by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (G)    Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with this
chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a
member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such
an affiliated group.

election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

purposes of this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date. If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as
paid on the dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and  are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return
is due on the same date as the filing of the federal tax return, unless

annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer's

cent of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed

      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made. For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (E)    An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

    described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has     been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's
qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

187.096 of this Chapter. 
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
187.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (C)    No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.

         (c)     In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the
amount shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
187.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
187.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
187.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
division (B)(1)(b) or (c) of Section
187.051 of this Chapter. 
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment.  For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may  not  be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
187.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
187.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.  The person shall provide the notice in a
signed affidavit that briefly explains the person's circumstances, including
the location of the previous worksite location and the last date on which the
person performed services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. 
The affidavit also shall include the following statement:  "The affiant has no
plans to perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales
in the municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by
the municipal corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.

reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in

as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the

which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in

         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or

(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal

be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.

withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.

extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax

income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the

      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied  by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and  interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
187.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
187.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

dollars.
   (B)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
187.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing

postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
187.10 of this Chapter.

   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

   187.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement. 
(Ord. 2015-27. Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the  Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
187.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
187.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
187.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
187.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
187.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
187.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
         (Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
      (3)   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled
in the Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. 
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (4)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (5)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (6)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (7)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (8)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (9)   A member of the Local Board of Tax Review may receive reimbursement
of expenses for service on the board, but other than for such reimbursement, no
compensation shall be paid to a member of the Board.
      (10)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code. For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)    (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
187.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five per cent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
187.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
187.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
187.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

the subject of the action pending in Case Number 2017 CV 10258 in the Franklin
County Court of Common Pleas, and that the City reserves its rights to continue
its participation in and prosecution of said litigation, and any other
litigation challenging the State’s authority to dictate municipal tax
collection and administration, and that adoption of this section shall not
prejudice the claims of the City therein.  (Ord. 2018-04.  Passed 2-26-18.)

unconstitutionality, illegality, or invalidity shall affect only such clause,
sentence, section or part of this chapter so found and shall not affect or
impair any of the remaining provisions, sentences, clauses, sections or other

or part thereof not been included in this chapter.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 12-14-15.)
   187.99  VIOLATIONS; PENALTY.

   (c)   No owner or operator shall remove an impounded vehicle from the place
of storage without complying with the above procedure.  Possession of a vehicle

   (a)   (1)   The Chief of Police upon complaint of any person adversely
affected may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63, that has been left on private
residential or private agricultural property for at least four hours without
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property.  The Chief of Police, upon complaint of a repair garage or place of
storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle, other than an abandoned junk
motor vehicle, that has been left at the garage or place of storage for a
longer period than that agreed upon. When ordering a motor vehicle into storage
pursuant to this section, the Chief of Police may arrange for the removal of
the motor vehicle by a towing service and shall designate a storage facility.
      (2)   A towing service towing a motor vehicle under subsection (a)(1) of
this section shall remove the motor vehicle in accordance with that
subsection.  The towing service shall deliver the motor vehicle to the location
designated by the Chief of Police not more than two hours after the time it is
removed from the private property, unless the towing service is unable to
deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due to an uncontrollable force,
natural disaster, or other event that is not within the power of the towing
service.
      (3)   Subject to subsection (b) of this section, the owner of a motor
vehicle that has been removed pursuant to this subsection may recover the

      (4)   As used in this section "private residential property" means
private property on which is located one or more structures that are used as a
home, residence or sleeping place by one or more persons, if no more than three
separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.  "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by
two or more persons, if more than three separate households are maintained in
the structure or structures.
   (b)   If the owner or operator of a motor vehicle that has been ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section arrives after the motor
vehicle has been prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the
property, the towing service shall give the owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give the owner
or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator may pay not
more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  That
fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a
mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available at the time of
the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor vehicles

location from which it was removed, the date and time of the removal, the
telephone number of the person from whom it may be recovered, and the address
of the place to which it has been taken and from which it may be recovered. 
The Chief of Police shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.
   (d)   (1)   The owner or lienholder of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor
vehicle from any private residential or private agricultural property other

   (g)   Whoever violates subsection (e) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken

of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes

subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;

private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains

storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles

motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having

property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and

(ORC 4513.64)
   303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.

power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a
utility.
   
   (b)   If an offender violates any section of this Traffic Code which
provides for an enhanced penalty for an offense committed while distracted and
the distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the
violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long
as the offender submits to the court both the offender’s payment in full and
such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

(ORC 4511.12)
   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
 313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield

thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by

use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall

vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.

highway that is temporarily covered by a rise in water level, including
groundwater or an overflow of water, and that is clearly marked by a sign that
specifies that the road is closed due to the rise in water level and that any
person who uses the closed portion of the road may be fined up to two thousand
dollars ($2,000).
   (b)   A person who is issued a citation for a violation of subsection (a)
hereof is not permitted to enter a written plea of guilty and waive the
person’s right to contest the citation in court, but instead must appear in
person in the proper court to answer the charge.
   (c)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (a) hereof is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
      (2)   In addition to the financial sanctions authorized or required under
Section
501.99 and to any costs otherwise authorized or required under any provision of

to reimburse one or more rescuers for the cost any such rescurer incurred in
rescuing the person, excluding any cost of transporting the rescued person to a
hospital or other facility for treatment of injuries, up to a cumulative
maximum of two thousand dollars ($2,000).  If more than one rescuer was
involved in the emergency response, the court shall allocate the reimbursement
proportionately, according to the cost each rescuer incurred.  A financial
sanction imposed under this section is a judgment in favor of the rescuer and,
subject to a determination of indigency under division (B) of Ohio R.C.
2929.28, a rescuer may collect the financial sanction in the same manner as
provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.28.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the

designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the

street or highway passing a school fronting upon the street or highway that is
encompassed by projecting the school property lines to the fronting street or
highway.  Upon request from the Municipality for streets and highways under its
jurisdiction, the Ohio Director of Transportation may extend the traditional
school zone boundaries.  The distances in subsections (b)(1)C.1. to 3. hereof
shall not exceed 300 feet per approach per direction and are bounded by
whichever of the following distances or combinations thereof the Director
approves as most appropriate:
            1.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school building
lines normal to the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            2.   The distance encompassed by projecting the school property
lines intersecting the fronting highway and extending a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of highway;
Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the Director's initial
action on August 9, 1976, establishing all school zones at the traditional
school zone boundaries defined by projecting school property lines, except when
those boundaries are extended as provided in subsections (b)(1)A. and C.
hereof.
         D.   As used in this subsection, "crosswalk" has the meaning given
that term in Section
301.09.  The Director may, upon request by resolution of Council, and upon
submission by the Municipality of such engineering, traffic and other
information as the Director considers necessary, designate a school zone on any
portion of a  State route lying within the Municipality that includes a
crosswalk customarily used by children going to or leaving a school during
recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured in a
straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of the crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet.  Such a school zone
shall include the distance encompassed by the crosswalk and extending 300 feet
on each approach direction of the State route;
      (2)   Twenty-five miles per hour in all other portions of the
Municipality, except on State routes outside business districts, through
highways outside business districts and alleys;

the Municipality other than freeways as provided in subsection (b)(10) and
(12);
      (8)   Sixty miles per hour on rural expressways with traffic control
signals and on all portions of rural divided highways, except as provided in
subsections (b)(9) and (10) of this section;
      (9)   Sixty-five miles per hour on all rural expressways without traffic
control signals;
      (10)   Seventy miles per hour on all rural freeways;
      (11)   Fifty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or
expressways in congested areas as determined by the Director and that are
located within a municipal corporation or within an interstate freeway
outerbelt, except as provided in subsection (b)(12) of this section;
      (12)   Sixty-five miles per hour on all portions of freeways or
expressways without traffic control signals in urbanized areas.
   (c)   It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed
limitations in subsection (b)(1)A. to  (b)(6) hereof, or any declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities and
it is unlawful for any person to exceed any of the speed limitations in
subsection (d) hereof.  No person shall be convicted of more than one violation
of this section for the same conduct, although violations of more than one
provision of this section may be charged in the alternative in a single
affidavit.
   (d)   No person shall operate a motor vehicle upon a street or highway as
follows:

highway, expressway or freeway as provided in subsection (b)(8), (9), (10) and
(12) hereof;

provided in subsection (b)(8) hereof;
      (3)   At a speed exceeding sixty-five miles per hour upon an expressway
as provided in subsection (b)(9) hereof, or upon a freeway as provided in
subsection (b)(12) of this section, except upon a freeway as provided in
subsection (b)(10) hereof;
      (4)   At a speed exceeding seventy miles per hour upon a freeway as
provided in subsection (b)(10) hereof;

expressway or freeway for which the Director has determined and declared a
speed limit pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.21(I)(2) or (L)(2).
   (e)   In every charge of violation of this section the affidavit and warrant
shall specify the time, place and speed at which the defendant is alleged to
have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the
speed limitations as established herein have been altered, either higher or
lower, and the appropriate signs giving notice have been erected as required,
operators of motor vehicles shall be governed by the speed limitations set
forth on such signs.  It is prima-facie unlawful for any person to exceed the
speed limits posted upon such signs.

two times the usual amount imposed for the violation upon an offender if the
offender alleges, in an affidavit filed with the court prior to the offender’s
sentencing, that the offender is indigent and is unable to pay the fine imposed
pursuant to this subsection and if the court determines that the offender is an
indigent person and unable to pay the fine. 
      (4)   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the
distracting activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense,
the offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section

either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class

guilty to one violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.203  or a substantially equivalent

the vehicle involved in the offense and the impoundment of that vehicle’s
license plates.  If issued, the order shall be issued and enforced under Ohio

         C.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4511.203 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the court may order the criminal forfeiture to
the state of the vehicle involved in the offense.  If issued, the order shall
be issued and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234.
If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture
under this subsection is assigned or transferred and division (B)(2) or (3) of
Ohio R.C. 4503.234 applies, in addition to or independent of any other penalty
established by law, the court may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as

   (d)   If a court orders the immobilization of a vehicle under subsection (c)
of this section, the court shall not release the vehicle from the

unless the court is presented with current proof of financial responsibility
with respect to that vehicle.
   (e)   If a court orders the criminal forfeiture of a vehicle under
subsection (c) of this section, upon receipt of the order from the court,
neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor any deputy registrar shall accept
any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any motor
vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the order.  The period of denial
shall be five years after the date the order is issued, unless, during that
five-year period, the court with jurisdiction of the offense that resulted in
the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the Registrar of the
termination.  If the court terminates the forfeiture and notifies the

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made and the operator has the operator’s driver’s license on or about
the operator’s person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima- facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in subsection (b)(2) hereof, whoever violates
this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

or other security necessary to compensate for any damage to a roadway or road
structure.
   For each such permit, the Police Chief shall charge ten dollars ($10.00),
and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent by each police officer in
supervising the movement of such vehicle, the applicant shall pay the sum of
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) per hour per officer.  The charge can be prorated
into fifteen minute increments.

it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by

constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,

      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.

not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose

any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.

offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the

   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the

   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.  (ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
    "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
    "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you
from the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality
and worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.

   EDITOR’S NOTE: See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.
   501.14  CONSPIRACY.
   (a)   No person, with purpose to commit or to promote or facilitate the
commission of aggravated murder, murder, kidnapping, abduction, compelling
prostitution, promoting prostitution, trafficking in persons, aggravated arson,
arson, aggravated robbery, robbery, aggravated burglary, burglary, engaging in
a pattern of corrupt activity, corrupting another with drugs, a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, theft of drugs,
or illegal processing of drug documents, the commission of a felony offense of
unauthorized use of a vehicle, illegally transmitting multiple commercial
electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
            If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the
amount of restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the
victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If
the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary
hearing on restitution if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount
of restitution.  If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.
            If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case
file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the
payment terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it
may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                            Maximum Fine
First degree                                   $5000.00
Second degree                                  4000.00
Third degree                                   3000.00
Fourth degree                                  2000.00
Minor                                          1000.00
Misdemeanor not specifically classified        2000.00
Minor misdemeanor not  specifically classified1000.00
      (1)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty
plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).
      (2)   When an organization is convicted of an offense that is not
specifically classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than
the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

   For the purposes of Sections
509.10,

509.13, the following terms, phrases, words and their derivations have the
meaning given herein.
   (a)   "Minor" means any person under the age of eighteen years.
   (b)   "Parent" means any person having legal custody of a minor:
      (1)   As a natural or adoptive parent,

Municipality, prima facie the time then observed in the Municipal
Administrative Offices and Police Station.
   (e)   "Year of age" continues from one birthday, such as the seventeenth to,
but not including the day of the next, such as the eighteenth birthday, making
it clear that seventeen or less years of age is herein treated as equivalent to
the phrase "under eighteen years of age".  Similarly, for example, eleven or
less years of age means under twelve years of age.
      (Ord. 92-63.  Passed 9-14-92.)
   509.11  CURFEW HOURS.

less years of age.
   (b)   During the months of June, July and August, no person seventeen or
less years of age shall be in or upon any public place during the period ending

   (c)   Any minor found violating this section and not falling under the

be returned home, and given a warning.  Further at that time the Chief of
Police or his designee shall, by certified mail, send to the parent of the
minor a written notice of the violation.  Service may also be accomplished in
lieu of certified mail by handing such parent a copy of such warning when the
minor is released to the parent.  Any minor violating the provisions of this
section and who has previously been given a written warning shall be guilty of
an act of unruliness.
(Ord. 92-81.  Passed 11-9-92.)
   509.12  EXCEPTIONS.
   In the following exceptional cases, a minor in or upon a public place during
the nocturnal hours for which Section
509.11 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not be
considered in violation of this chapter:
   (a)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor.
   (b)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor to
take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area.
   (c)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United States
Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech and the
right of assembly.  Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such exercise
by first delivering to the Police Department written communication signed by
such minor and countersigned if practicable by a parent of such minor with
their home address and telephone number, addressed to the Police Chief
specifying when, where and in what matter the minor will be in a public place
at night during the hours when this chapter is otherwise applicable to the
minor, in the exercise of a First Amendment right specified in such
communication.
   (d)   In a case of reasonable necessity where the minor is on an emergency
errand or upon a business trip directed or ordered by his parent.
   (e)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides.
   (f)   When returning home by a direct route from, and within thirty minutes
of, the termination of a school activity, or an activity of a religious or
other voluntary association, of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for
immediate reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on
duty at the Police Station.
   (g)   When authorized by special permit from the Mayor, carried on the
person of the minor, when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be
inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter.  A written
application shall be given to the Mayor, signed by a minor and by a parent of
such minor, if feasible, stating:
      (1)   The name, age and address of such minor;
      (2)   The name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof;
      (3)   The height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical
characteristics of such minor;
      (4)   The necessity which requires such minor be in or upon a public
place during the curfew hours otherwise applicable; and
      (5)   The street or route and the beginning and ending of the period of
time involved by date and hour;
      The Mayor may grant a permit in writing for the use by the minor of those
public places at such hours as in the Mayor's opinion may reasonably be
necessary.  In an emergency, this may be handled by telephone, or other
effective communication, with a corresponding record being made
contemporaneously, either to the Mayor, or if unavailable, to the Police Chief.
   (h)   When authorized, by regulation issued by the Mayor, in other similar
cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary
nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an
individual special permit basis.  Normally such regulation by the Mayor
permitting use of public places should be issued sufficiently in advance to
permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such
as the schools, and shall define the activity, the scope of the use of public
places permitted, and the period of time involved not to extend more than
thirty minutes beyond the time for termination of such activity.
   (i)   When the minor carries a certified card or letter issued by the
minor's employer and which card or letter sets forth the place of employment
and his hours of employment and the minor is returning from such employment
within a reasonable time from the final hour of employment as stated in such
card or letter.
      (Ord. 92-63.  Passed 9-14-92.)
   509.13  PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   (a)   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or by
inefficient control allow such minor to be in or upon any public place under
circumstances not constituting  an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of this chapter.  "Knowingly" includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent's legal custody.  It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test.  It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
   (b)   It shall be an affirmative defense to this section that such parent
has within thirty days preceding the alleged violation filed or caused to be
filed a complaint against such minor under Ohio R.C. 2151.27.
   (c)   A parent who violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
for the first offense and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree for each
subsequent offense.

      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section

section.

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm

   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,

 545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
 545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving
a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a scheme or
course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If

 545.05 or

service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses
may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series.

span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.

   557.04  INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS; PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Any person subjected to an unlawful housing practice may file within
360 days of the alleged violation with the Board a complaint in writing, sworn
to or affirmed, which
shall state:
      (1)    The name and address of the person aggrieved;
      (2)    The name and address of the person against whom the complaint is
filed;
      (3)    A description and the address of the dwelling which involves the
alleged discriminatory housing practice or employment practice;
      (4)    A concise statement of the facts including pertinent dates,
constituting the alleged discriminatory housing or employment practice; and
      (5)    Such other information as may be required by the Board. The
complaint may be reasonably and fairly amended. The Board may also corroborate
or initiate complaints on the basis of studies carried out by its staff or
volunteers authorized by the Board.
   (b)    Upon the filing of the complaint, the Secretary of the Board shall
make such investigations as he deems appropriate to ascertain facts and issues.
Such investigation shall be conducted within fourteen business days after the
filing of the complaint. The investigation may be extended when deemed
necessary by the Chairman of the Human Rights Board. If the Secretary
determines that there are reasonable grounds to believe a violation has
occurred, he shall attempt to conciliate the matter by methods of initial
conference and persuasion with all interested parties and such representatives
as the parties may choose to assist them. Conciliation conferences shall be
informal and nothing said or done during such initial conferences shall be made
public by any member of the Board or its staff unless the persons agree thereto
in writing.
   (c)    The terms of conciliation agreed to by the parties shall be reduced
to writing and incorporated into a consent agreement to be signed by the
parties, which agreement is for conciliation purposes and does not constitute
an admission by any parties that the law has been violated. A consent agreement
shall be signed on behalf of the Board by its Chairman.
   (d)    The Board is authorized to seek the cooperation and aid of the Ohio
Real Estate Commission, Ohio Civil Rights Commission, or the U. S. Department
of Housing and Urban Development and any other person or group regarding any
matters before the Board.
   (e)    If the Secretary determines that the complaint lacks reasonable
grounds upon which to base a violation of this chapter, he shall so inform the
Board and the Board may, in its discretion, dismiss such complaint or order
such further investigation as may be necessary, provided that the Board shall
not dismiss such complaint without first affording either party an opportunity
to appear before the Board.
   (f)   If the Secretary, with respect to a matter which involves a violation
of this chapter, fails to conciliate a complaint after the parties have in good
faith attempted such conciliation, or fails to effect an informal conciliation
agreement or an informal consent agreement or determines that a complaint is
not susceptible to conciliation, he shall so notify the Board.  The Board shall
thereafter schedule a public hearing to determine whether a violation of this
chapter has been committed. The Board shall serve upon the respondent a written
statement of the charges, and a summons and shall serve upon all interested
parties a notice of the time and place of the hearing. The respondent or his
authorized counsel may file and amend such statements with the Board prior to
the hearing date as it deems necessary in support of its position. The hearing
shall be open to the public. The hearing shall be held not less than fifteen
calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days after service of the statement
of charges and summons. The summons so issued must be signed by two members of
the Board, and the issuance of such summons shall require the attendance of
named persons and the production of relevant documents and records. The failure
to comply with a summons shall constitute a violation of this chapter. The
interested parties may, at their option, appear before the Board in person or
by a duly authorized representative and may have the assistance of an attorney.
The parties may present testimony in evidence and the right to cross-examine
witnesses shall be preserved. All testimony in evidence shall be given under
oath or by affirmation. The Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,
which records shall be public and open to inspection by any person. Upon
request by any principal party to the proceeding, the Board shall furnish such
party a copy of the hearing record, at such cost as the Board deems
appropriate.
   (g)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines that the
person complained against has violated this chapter, the Board shall, after
consultation with the Law Director, in executive session, state its findings to
and call upon the Law Director to prepare and issue an order under the Board
directive requiring the person complained against to cease and desist from such
unlawful conduct and to take such affirmative action as will effectuate the
purpose of this chapter, with notice that if the Board determines that the
person complained against has not after fifteen calendar days following service
of the Board's order complied with the order, the Board will recertify the
matter to the Law Director for enforcement. The Law Director shall seek
compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Human Rights
Board before a court of competent jurisdiction.
   (h)    If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the Board determines that the
person complained against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall so
state and publish its findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

notice of such establishment or change in grade, and of the fact that plats
have been prepared and are on file in his office, subject to the owner's
inspection. Such notices shall be served on all residents of the City in the
manner provided by law for the service of summons in a civil action with a copy
thereof to be returned to the Director endorsed by the officer or person

persons not found may be made in the manner provided in Ohio R.C. 729.03 and

      (3)    At any time within ten days following completion of service of
such notice, the owner shall have the right of appeal of such order of
establishment or change of grade to Council, which shall hear such appeal and
render its decision by majority vote, which shall be final.
   (b)    If or after the grade for such improvement has been established the
Director shall prepare and cause to be filed in his office, plans and
specifications for the construction or repair contemplated, setting forth
clearly the scope of the work, with full dimensions, the type, quality and

employed and such other matters as may be appropriate.

accordance with the City's requirements. Applicants shall give bond in an
amount to be determined by the Director, but in no case less than five hundred

authorized representative, and that the area affected by the work shall be
restored to equal or better than its original condition and such condition
maintained, at the cost of the permit holder, for a period of one year after
the completion of the work, provided, however, that such cash bond may be
released at an earlier period if, in the opinion of the Safety-Service Director
such release is warranted. The amount of such cash deposit shall be
commensurate with the extent of the work and shall be determined by the Safety-
Service Director or his agent, but in no case shall the amount of such cash
deposit be less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for any one project. City
departments shall be required to obtain such permits, however, the deposit
shall be waived.
   (c)    The applicant shall cause a record, by video taping, of the area to
be excavated, to be provided prior to excavation depicting landscaping,
landscape features, sidewalks, curbing, driveways, aprons, fences, walls or
drainage ways. Such pre-excavation record shall be recorded on video tape, or
other photo recording with the approval of the Safety-Service Director, and
submitted to his office.
      (1)    In the event the Safety-Service Director deems the project of a
minor nature, the prerecording above can be waived or in the alternative, a
substitute record of conditions prior to excavation may be submitted by the
applicant as requested by the Safety-Service Director.
      (2)    In the event the applicant fails to make such record of the
conditions prior to construction, the Safety-Service Director is directed to

   (b)    The following exemptions shall apply regarding the fee set forth in
subsection (a) hereof, for opening a new or newly improved street:
      (1)    Individual sanitary sewer laterals under improved streets shall be
exempted from the payment schedule. Connections to natural gas, water or sewer
mains to serve new buildings shall also be exempt from the payment schedule
listed above. The providing for service to these vacant parcels shall be
planned for prior to a street reconstruction or repaving project and where
practical shall be installed in advance so as to prevent disturbing the new
street during the ten year period following construction.
      (2)    All utilities shall be eligible for a waiver or exemption from the
new street opening payment requirements based on a project by project review.
The individual utility involved must see that an investigation is carried out
and a report filed with the City explaining in detail the reasoning for leaving
existing facilities such as piping, valves, and other appurtenances in the
right of way of a proposed street improvement.
      (3)    If repairs or replacements to underground facilities are made, a
report shall be submitted which details the extent of the repairs and/or
replacement of facilities which demonstrates an effort on the part of the
utility to reduce the need for re-entering the street following the
improvements.
      (4)    The Director of Public Service and Safety or his designee shall
review such reports and investigations and shall determine if an exemption from
the street opening payment is in order due to the condition of the underground
facilities and the efforts made by the utility company to prevent the need to
disturb the new street, sidewalk or other improvements in the future. The
decision to exempt the utility from the street opening payment schedule shall
be made by the City and the Director of Public Service and Safety's decision
shall be final. Any application for exemption from payment shall be filed prior
to the completion of the construction of street improvements.
      (5)    The City shall have the right to waive the street opening payment
in the case of an opening required as a result of a natural disaster such as
flood or earthquake, but shall not be limited to these disasters listed. The
Director of Public Service and Safety shall also have the authority to waive
payments as required under the payment schedule in subsection (a) hereof if it
is determined that the need to open a street that has been resurfaced or
reconstructed in the ten-year period shown on the schedule is due to
circumstances beyond the control of the utility involved or is the result of
unusual conditions that could not have been foreseen during street resurfacing
or reconstruction.
   (c)    An Appeals Board shall be established which will review appeals made
by individuals, corporations or contractors who are not satisfied with the
decision made by the Director of Public Service and Safety regarding the
exemption section of this chapter. The Board shall hear both parties and make a
decision based on the information provided. The decision of the Appeal s Board
shall be final.
   The Appeals Board shall be made up of three members:
      (1)    Chairman of the Streets and Sidewalk Committee;
      (2)    A representative who shall be a resident of the City of St. Marys
and appointed by the Mayor;
      (3)    A third member to be chosen by the other two members of the
Committee; preferably a person knowledgeable in construction of streets,
sidewalks or operation of underground facilities, and a resident of the City.
(Ord. 86-76. Passed 11-10-86.)
   909.99  PENALTY.
   Any person, organization, company or corporation who violates any provision
of this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a minor misdemeanor and upon
conviction thereof shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
Each and every day during which such violation is allowed to continue may be
deemed a separate offense.

   (i)   Unusual Discharge.  No person shall cause or permit an unusual
discharge to the public sewers without first obtaining the approval of the
Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio.  An
unusual discharge criteria is:
      (1)   A discharge through a non-permanent or non-approved entry point in
the sewer system;
      (2)   Is not the result of a normal business operation; or
      (3)   Is a one time special discharge.
   No provision of this section shall prevent an agreement between the City and
the discharger whereby wastewater with unusual strength or character may be
discharged to the treatment works subject to additional charges and fees set
forth in the Director’s Rules and Regulations.  No agreement entered into
between the City and a discharger will violate the general and specific
discharge limitations set forth in this section or any other Federal or State
regulations or standards including the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards.
   Unusual waste includes but is not limited to unregulated process waste,
leachate, condensate or any other discharge related to a land fill or landfill
type operation.  Each unusual discharger will submit analytical data and the
maximum proposed volumes to be discharged and the Approval Authority will
provide guidance on an individual basis.
   (j)   Pretreatment Facilities.  Dischargers shall provide wastewater
treatment as necessary to comply with this ordinance and shall achieve
compliance with all Categorical Pretreatment Standards and Local Limits within
the time limitations specified by US EPA, the Ohio EPA, or the Approval
Authority, whichever is more stringent.  Any facilities necessary for
compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the discharger’s
expense.  Detailed plans describing such facilities and operating procedures
shall be submitted to the Approval Authority and the Ohio EPA for review, and
shall be acceptable to the Approval Authority and approved by the Director of
the Ohio EPA before such facilities are constructed.  The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the discharger from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the City of St. Marys under the provisions of this ordinance.
      (1)   Whenever deemed necessary, the City of St. Marys may require
dischargers to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods or wet weather
events, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste
streams from industrial waste streams, and such other conditions as may be
necessary to protect the POTW and determine the discharger’s compliance with
the requirements of this ordinance.
      (2)   The Approval Authority may require any person discharging into the
POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at their expense, a
suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow.
      (3)   Users with potential to discharge flammable substances may be
required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
      (4)   Dischargers shall provide grease, oil and sand separators when they
are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing excessive
amounts of grease or any flammable waste, sand or other harmful substances;
except that such separators shall not be required for premises used exclusively
for residential purposes.  Separators shall be located for accessible
inspection and cleaning.  Grease, oil and sand separator facilities shall be
maintained continuously in safe, satisfactory and effective operational
condition by the owner at his expense.
      (5)   Where additional pretreatment and/or operation and maintenance
activities will be required to comply with this section, the industrial
discharger shall submit a reasonable schedule by which the additional
pretreatment and/or implementation of additional operation and maintenance
activities will be provided.  The schedule shall be subject to the approval of
the Director but shall not exceed two years for St. Marys standards except for
unusual circumstances.  Any compliance schedule related to a categorical
standard shall not exceed the time limit provided in the regulation.  The
dischargers shall provide the following information:
         A.   Milestone dates for the commencement and completion of major
events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment
required for the discharger to comply with the requirements of this section,
such as completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major
components, commencing and completing construction, and other acts necessary to
achieve compliance with this section except that:
         B.   The Director shall not permit a time increment for any single
milestone date to exceed nine months; and
         C.   The discharger shall submit no later than fourteen (14) days
following each milestone date in the schedule and the final date for
compliance, a progress report to the Director, including a statement that they
complied with the increment of progress represented by the milestone date and,
if not, the date on which they expect to comply with the particular increment
of progress, the reason for the failure to timely complete the increment
progress, and the steps taken to return the construction to the approved
schedule.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress
reports.
         D.   When the Director accepts the discharger’s compliance schedule
for additional pretreatment or operation and maintenance, a violation of the
compliance schedule is a violation of this ordinance.
   (k)   Slug Discharge Control.  No person shall cause the discharge of slugs
of water or wastes into the public sewers.  Each person producing a slug
discharge into the public sewer shall construct and maintain, at the person’s
expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to insure equalization
discharge over a twenty-four (24) hour period.
   This facility shall have a capacity of at least twenty percent (20%) of the
total normal volume of a twenty-four hour production period, and the outlet to
the sewer shall be equipped with a rate discharge controller, or other approved
device, the regulation of which shall be directed by the Approving Authority.
   The Approval Authority shall evaluate whether each SIU needs an accidental
discharge/slug discharge control plan or other action to control slug
discharges.  The approval authority may require any discharger to develop,
submit for approval, and implement such a plan or take such other action that
may be necessary to control slug discharges.  Alternatively, the approval
authority may develop such a plan for any discharger.  An accidental discharge/
slug discharge control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
      (1)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch
discharges;
      (2)   Description of stored chemicals;
      (3)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Director of any accidental
or slug discharge; and
      (4)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug
discharge.  Such procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and
maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of materials, loading and
unloading operations, control of plant site runoff, worker training, building
of containment structures or equipment, measures for containing toxic organic
pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment for emergency
response.
   (i)   Spill Control.  Every discharger shall provide safeguards against
accidental release to the treatment works of prohibited or non-conforming
substances that would violate the Industrial Pretreatment Program limits as
contained in this section.
      (1)   Each discharger shall provide safeguards against the accidental
release to the treatment works of prohibited, or limited substances as set
forth in this section and the rules and regulations of the Director. 
Additionally, safeguards shall be provided for the hazardous substances
identified in Section 311 of the Clean Water Act.  At a minimum each discharger
who stores 1,000 gallons or more of liquid substances identified by Section 311
of the Clean Water Act shall have on file a spill control plan prepared by a
registered professional engineer.  This discharger shall file a letter with the
Director indicating that such a plan is in effect.  Any facilities or
procedures to prevent accidental releases shall be provided and maintained at
the discharger’s expense.
      (2)   Each discharger shall take reasonable and necessary steps to reduce
or eliminate any adverse effect of an accidental discharge on the City’s
treatment works.
      (3)   In the case of an accidental release, it shall be the discharger’s
responsibility to report all accidents to the approval authority.
   (m)   Baseline Monitoring.  All industrial users discharging or proposing to
connect to the treatment works, shall complete and file with the Director of
Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio a written, baseline
monitoring report.  These new industrial dischargers shall file a report at
least ninety days before connecting to the treatment works which shall consist
of:
      (1)   Name, address and location of the industrial discharger;

      (8)   Nature, exact description and concentration of any pollutant or
substance in the discharge;
      (9)   Statements whether compliance with the St. Marys Industrial
Pretreatment Program is being achieved on a consistent basis;
      (10)   Any information regarding the discharge that may effect the St.
Marys WWTP;
      (11)   The Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio, at his discretion, may request additional information;
      (12)   Signature of:
         A.   For a corporation, a principal executive officer or a duly
authorized representative responsible for the overall operation of the facility
discharging to the treatment works.
         B.   For a partnership or proprietorship, a general partner or the
proprietor.
         C.   When required by the Director a qualified engineer.
      (13)   The Director shall evaluate the complete report and data furnished
by the industrial discharger and may require additional information.  After
full evaluation and acceptance of the data furnished, the Director shall notify
the discharger of his acceptance.
      (14)   Demonstration of compliance with Best Management Practices, when
required by the Approval Authority.
   (n)   Reporting Accidental Release and/or Permit Limit Violations.  Upon an
accidental release or operating upset resulting in a prohibited discharge and/
or a discharge in excess of limitation into the treatment works and/or any
watercourse or storm sewer within the City’s boundary, dischargers shall
immediately notify the Approval Authority by telephone of the incident.  The
notification shall include the date, time, and location of the discharge, type
of waste, concentration, and volume and the corrective actions taken.  If
sampling performed by a User indicates a violation, the User must notify the
Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys within twenty-
four (24) hours of becoming aware of the violation.  The User shall also repeat
the sampling and analysis and submit the result to the Director of Public
Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys within thirty (30) days after
becoming aware of the violation.  Re-sampling by the Industrial User is not
required if the City performs sampling at the User’s facility at least once per
month or if the City performs sampling at the User’s facility between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the results of the
sampling are received, or if the City has performed the sampling and analysis
in lieu of the User.
      (1)   Within five (5) working days following any such accidental
discharge, operating upset, or permit limit violation, the discharger shall
submit to the Approval Authority a detailed written report describing the
following:
         A.   Description of the discharge and its cause;
         B.   Type of waste, concentration and volume;
         C.   Duration of the discharge, including exact date and time, and if
the discharge continues, the time when it will cease;
         D.   All steps taken or to be taken to reduce, eliminate or prevent
recurrence of the incident and to reduce or eliminate any adverse effect of the
discharge on the City’s treatment works.
      (2)   Dischargers shall permanently post emergency notification
procedures on a bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom
to call in the event of an accidental discharge or operating upset.
      (3)   A documented and verified operating upset may be an affirmative
defense to an enforcement action brought by the Approval Authority against an
industrial discharger for any noncompliance which arises out of violation
alleged to have occurred during the period of upset; however, it does not
absolve the discharger from responsibility and liability for any damage or
injury to persons or property including the City’s treatment works.  It
likewise does not absolve the discharger from liability for indemnification of
the City for any penalties for violation of the City’s NPDES Permit or for
cleanup costs caused by the upset.
   (o)   Self-Monitoring and Sampling.    All self-monitoring will include
information of the quality and quantity of the discharge by the industry to the
treatment works.  Quarterly reports are required on March 15th, June 15th,
September 15th and December 15th of every year.  This monitoring report will
include items 1, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10 from the baseline monitoring, subsection
(k).  Quantity measurements as listed in item 7 are required for this report
and should be made via a twenty-four (24) hour composite sample that is flow-
proportioned or time proportioned.  The report should designate a daily flow
and signify which type of measurement was taken.  The discharger should also
include in the report the average daily flow and maximum instantaneous
discharge flow rate for the quarter.  The Director of Public Service and Safety
for the City of St. Marys, Ohio reserve the right to modify the sampling
schedule at his discretion.
      (1)   Each person discharging industrial wastes into a public sewer shall
construct and maintain one or more control manholes or access points to
facilitate observation, measurement and sampling of the person’s wastes,
including domestic sewage.  Control manholes or access facilities shall be
located and built in a manner acceptable to the Approving Authority.  If
measuring devices are to be permanently installed, they shall be of a type
acceptable to the Approving Authority.  Control manholes, access facilities and
related equipment shall be installed by the person discharging the waste, at
the person’s expense, and shall be maintained so as to be in safe condition,
accessible and in proper operating condition at all times.  Plans for the
installation of the control manholes, or access facilities, and related
equipment, shall be approved by the Approving Authority prior to the beginning
of construction.
      (2)   The volume of flow used for computing industrial waste surcharges
shall be the metered water consumption of the person, as shown in the records
of meter readings maintained by the City of St. Marys.  If the person
discharging industrial wastes into the public sewers procures any part, or all
of the water from sources other than the City of St. Marys, all or part of
which is discharged into the public sewers, the person shall install and
maintain, at the person’s expense, water meters of a type approved by the
Approving Authority for the purpose of determining the volume of water obtained
from these other sources.
      (3)   Devices for measuring the volume of waste discharged may be
required by the Approving Authority if these volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered water consumption records.  Metering devices for
determining the volume of waste shall be installed, owned and maintained by the
person.  Following approval and installation, such meters may not be removed
without the consent of the Approving Authority.
      (4)   Industrial wastes discharged into the public sewers shall be
subject to periodic inspection and a determination of character and
concentration of such wastes.  The determinations shall be made as often as may
be deemed necessary by the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City
of St. Marys, Ohio.  Samples shall be collected in such a manner as to be
representative of the composition of the wastes.  The sampling may be
accomplished either manually or by the use of mechanical equipment acceptable
to the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio. 
Installation, operation and maintenance of the sampling facilities shall be the
responsibility of the person discharging the waste and shall be subject to the
approval of the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio at all times.  Every care shall be exercised in the collection of
samples to insure their preservation in a state comparable to that at the time
the sample was taken.
      (5)   Laboratory procedures used in the examination of industrial wastes
shall be those set forth in “Standard Methods.” However, alternate methods for
certain analysis of industrial wastes may be used subject to mutual agreement
between the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys,
Ohio and the person.  Determination of the character and concentration of the
industrial wastes shall be made by the person discharging them, or the person’s
agent, as designated and required by the Director of Public Service and Safety
for the City of St. Marys, Ohio.  The City may also make its own analysis on
wastes.
      (6)   When it is deemed necessary by the Director of Public Service and
Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio or when the subject of mutual agreement
between the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys,
Ohio and the person, the City may perform sampling operations and analysis of
industrial waste which are the responsibility of the person discharging the
waste.  Fees for such sampling and analysis services shall be determined and
established by the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio.
      (7)   All industrial dischargers which discharge industrial wastes shall
when required by the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio provide and operate at their own expense monitoring facilities at
each discharge point to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of
each sewer discharge to the treatment works.  These facilities shall be
constructed in accordance with plans and specifications approved by the
Director.  Each monitoring facility shall be situated on the discharger’s
premises, except where such a location would be impractical or cause undue
hardship to the discharger.  The Director may concur with the facility being
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area if the facility is located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.  There shall
be ample room in and near such sampling facility to allow accurate sampling and
preparation of sampling for analysis.  The facility, sampling and measuring
equipment, shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition at the expense of the industrial discharger.
      (8)   The Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio, may inspect the monitoring facilities of any industrial discharger
to determine compliance with the requirements of the rules, regulations and
standards of the Director.  The discharger shall allow the Director or his
representatives to enter upon the premises of the discharger at all reasonable
hours, for inspecting, sampling or examining records.  The Director shall have
the right to cause to be set upon the discharger’s property such devices as are
necessary to conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and indoor
metering operations and the costs shall be borne by the discharger.
      (9)   All analysis required under this section shall be performed in
accordance with Standard Methods as outlined in subsection (o)(5) above or 40
CFR 136, as may be amended; except where neither, includes a sampling or
analytical technique for the pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall
be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the USEPA
publication “Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial
Effluents for Priority Pollutants, “April, 1977, as may be amended, or in
accordance with any other sampling or analytical procedures approved by the
Administrator of the USEPA.
   (p)   Enforcement.  The Director of Public Service and Safety for the City
of St. Marys, Ohio reserves the right to prohibit any discharge which will
present potential harm to health, the environment, the wastewater treatment
plant, the collection system or may cause a violation of its NPDES permit. 
This includes any change in the flow rate or quantities that are coming to the
treatment works.  He may:
      (1)   Reject the waste;
      (2)   Require acceptable pretreatment as a condition for discharge to the
public sewers;
      (3)   Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge;
      (4)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treat
wastes not covered using taxes or sewer charges;
      (5)   Require new industrial customers or industries with significant
changes in strength or flow to submit information to the Approval Authority
concerning the proposed flows.
      (6)   If the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio permits the pretreatment or equalization of discharges, the design
and installation of the facilities for pretreatment or equalization shall be
subject to review and approval of the Director of the Ohio Environmental
Protection Agency (OEPA) and the Director of Public Service and Safety for the
City of St. Marys, Ohio in accordance with Ohio R.C. Section 6111.  The
property owner or discharger shall not begin construction of facilities until
approvals in writing have been obtained by both the Director and Director of
the OEPA.
      (7)   If the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio deems a violation of the pretreatment limits needs further
explanation, he can, at his discretion, request that an administrative hearing
be held in which the industry will be asked to justify their actions before the
Director.  If a plan can be formulated to resolve the situation, it shall be
reduced to writing and a compliance schedule attached.  If an acceptable
solution can not be found or the situation is deemed to be critical, the
Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio will
order the termination of service.
   Written notice of the termination of service to the discharger for the
City’s treatment works shall be served upon the discharger within five (5) days
of such suspension.  Delivery by certified or registered U.S. mail will be
deemed to have satisfied the service notice requirements.
   Upon failure of a discharger to voluntarily comply with a termination order
within the specified time, the Director of Public Service and Safety for the
City of St. Marys, Ohio shall immediately begin judicial proceeding to compel
the discharger’s compliance.  Should the discharger then comply with the order,
all proceedings will cease.  The discharger will reduce to writing the action
he will take to come into compliance.  The City, however, reserves, the right
to recover costs incurred for enforcing the compliance of the order.
   (q)   Termination of Service.  The City of St. Marys can seek termination of
service for the following reasons:
      (1)   Any discharger that fails to factually report its wastewater
constituents and characteristics of its discharge;
      (2)   Any discharger which fail to report significant changes in its
wastewater constituents or characteristics;
      (3)   Any dischargers which refuses the Director of Public Service and
Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio request for reasonable access to its
premises for the purpose of inspection or monitoring of discharges;
      (4)   Any industrial discharger which violates the provisions of this
section, the rules set forth by the Director of Public Service and Safety for
the City of St. Marys, Ohio, or any judicial order entered with respect
thereto.
   (r)   Notification of Violation Administrative Adjustment.  Whenever the
Director finds that any discharger who has engaged in conduct which justifies
termination of a wastewater treatment service, the Director shall serve or
cause to be served upon the discharger a written notice, either personally or
by certified or registered mail, return receipt requested, stating the nature
of the alleged violation.
      (1)   Within thirty (30) days within the date of receipt of the notice,
the discharger shall respond in writing to the Director advising of its
position with respect to the allegations.  In this case, the Director has made
a determination that the discharge does not need to be terminated immediately. 
Thereafter, the parties shall meet to ascertain the accuracy, lawfulness and
reasonableness of the findings, and where necessary to establish an
administrative adjustment plan for the satisfactory correction of the
violation.
   (s)   Show Cause Hearing.  Where a violation is not corrected in a timely
manner, the Director may order any discharger causing or allowing conduct
prohibited to show cause before the Director why the proposed service
termination action should not be taken.  A written notice shall be served on
the discharger by personal service or certified or registered mail, return
receipt requested, specifying the time and place of a hearing to be held by the
Director regarding the violation.  The notice shall include the reasons why the
enforcement action is to be taken, the proposed enforcement action, and shall
direct the discharger to show cause before the Director why the proposed
enforcement action should not be taken.  The notice shall be served at least
ten (10) days before the hearing.  Service may be on any statutory agent,
officer or authorized representative of the discharger.  The Director shall
consider the proceedings at the hearing and shall then enter appropriate orders
with respect to the alleged violation.  The discharger may appeal to a court of
competent jurisdiction in accordance with applicable laws.
   (t)   Enforcement Actions; Annual Publication.  At least annually, the City
shall publish in a newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful
public notice within the jurisdiction served by the City a list of all
industrial users which at any time during the previous twelve (12) months were
in significant noncompliance with applicable pretreatment requirements.  For
the purposes of this provision, an industrial user is in significant
noncompliance if its violations meet one or more of the following criteria:
      (1)   Chronic violations of wastewater discharge limits, defined here as
those in which sixty-six percent (66%) or more of all of the measurements taken
during a six-month period exceed a numeric pretreatment standard or

entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information, under the
law.  Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as
confidential information.
   (y)   Record Retention.  Industrial dischargers subject to this provision
shall keep all written information relating to the monitoring, sampling and
chemical analysis of its discharge for at least five (5) years.
   (z)   Right to Enter.  The City or its representative shall have the right
of entry to the industrial user premises in which a discharge source or
treatment system is located or in which records are required to be kept to
assure compliance with the pretreatment standards.  This entry will include all
inspections, surveillance and monitoring procedures necessary to determine,
independent of the information supplied by industrial users, compliance or not
with the pretreatment requirements of all applicable rules and regulations.
   (aa)   Waiver of Sampling.  Any industrial discharger that is subject to a
categorical pretreatment standard can forgo sampling requirements for
particular pollutants if the discharger can demonstrate to the appropriate
state and federal authorities and Director of Public Service and Safety for the
City of St. Marys, Ohio through sampling and other technical factors that the
pollutant is neither present nor expected to be present in the discharge.  This
authorization is subject to the following conditions:
      (1)   The waiver may be authorized where a pollutant is determined to be
present solely due to sanitary wastewater discharged from the facility provided
that the sanitary wastewater is not regulated by an applicable categorical
standard and otherwise includes no process wastewater;
      (2)   The monitoring waiver is valid only for the duration of the
effective period of the individual wastewater discharge permit, but in no case
longer than five (5) years.  The User must submit a new request for the waiver
before the waiver can be granted for each subsequent individual wastewater
discharge permit;
      (3)   In making a demonstration that a pollutant is not present, the
Industrial User must provide data from at least one sampling of the facility’s
process wastewater prior to any treatment present at the facility that is
representative of all wastewater from all processes;
      (4)   The request for a monitoring waiver must be signed in accordance
with this section and include the certification statement in 40 CFR 403.6(a)(2)
(ii);
      (5)   Non-detectable sample results may be used only as a demonstration
that a pollutant is not present if the EPA approved method from 40 CFR Part 136
with the lowest minimum detection level for that pollutant was used in the
analysis;
      (6)   Any grant of the monitoring waiver by the Director of Public
Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio must be included as a
condition in the User’s permit.  The reasons supporting the waiver and any
information submitted by the User in its request for the waiver must be
maintained by the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St.
Marys, Ohio for three (3) years after expiration of the waiver;
      (7)   Upon approval of the monitoring waiver and revision of the User’s
permit by the Director of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys,
Ohio, the Industrial User must certify on each report with the statement that
there has been no increase in the pollutant in its waste stream due to
activities of the Industrial User:
         A.   “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with
a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted.  Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete.  I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violation”.
      (8)   In the event that a waivered pollutant is found to be present or is
expected to be present because of changes that occur in the User’s operations,
the User must immediately: Comply with the monitoring requirements of this
section or other more frequent monitoring requirements imposed by the Director
of Public Service and Safety for the City of St. Marys, Ohio, and notify the
Director thereof;
      (9)   This provision does not supersede certification processes and
requirements established in Categorical Pretreatment Standards, except as
otherwise specified in the Categorical Pretreatment Standard.
   (bb)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Requirement.  No significant
Industrial User shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first
obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit from the Approval
Authority.
      (1)   The Approval Authority may require other dischargers to obtain
individual wastewater discharge permits as necessary to carry out the purpose
of this ordinance.
      (2)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of an individual
wastewater discharge permit shall be deemed a violation of this ordinance and
subjects the wastewater discharge permittee to the sanctions set out in this
section.  Obtaining an individual wastewater discharge permit does not relieve
a permittee of its obligation to comply with all Federal and State Pretreatment
standards or requirements or with any other requirements of Federal, State, and
Local laws.
   (cc)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting: Existing Connections. 
Any discharger required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who
was discharging wastewater into the POTW prior to the effective date of this
ordinance and who wishes to continue such discharges in the future, shall,
within thirty (30) days after Approval Authority notification, apply for an
individual wastewater discharge permit and shall not cause or allow discharges
to the POTW to continue after sixty (60) days of the effective date of this
ordinance except in accordance with an individual wastewater discharge permit
issued by the Approval Authority.
   (dd)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permitting: New Connections.  Any
discharger required to obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit who
proposes to begin or resume discharging into the POTW must obtain a permit
prior to the beginning or resuming of such discharge.  An application for this
individual wastewater discharge permit must be filed at least thirty (30) days
prior to the date upon which any discharge will begin or resume.
   (ee)   Application Signatories and Certifications.  All wastewater discharge
permit applications, reports and certification statements must be signed by an
Authorized Representative of the User and contain the certification statement.
      (1)   Certification of Permit Applications, User Reports, and Initial
Monitoring Waiver - The following certification statement is required to be
signed and submitted by Users submitting permit applications; Users submitting
baseline monitoring reports; Users submitting reports on compliance with the
Categorical Pretreatment Standard deadlines; and Users submitting an initial
request to forego sampling of a pollutant.  The certification statement must be
signed by an Authorized Representative as defined in this section and follow
subsection (aa)(7)A. hereof.
   (ff)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Decisions.  The Approval
Authority will evaluate the data furnished by the discharger and may require
additional information.  Within ten (10) days of receipt of a complete baseline
monitoring report, the Approval Authority will determine whether to issue an
individual wastewater discharge permit.  The Approval Authority may deny any
application for an individual wastewater discharge permit.
   (gg)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Duration.  An individual
wastewater discharge permit shall be issued for a specified time period, not to
exceed five (5) years from the effective date of the permit.  An individual
wastewater discharge permit may be issued for a period less than five (5)
years, at a discretion of the Approval Authority.  Each individual wastewater
discharge permit will indicate a specific date upon which it will expire.
   (hh)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Contents.  An individual
wastewater discharge permit shall include such conditions as are deemed
reasonably necessary by the Approval Authority to prevent Pass Through or
Interference, protect the quality of the water body receiving the treatment

   (ii)   Permit Modification.  The Approval Authority may modify an individual
wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including, but not limited to, the
following reasons:
      (1)   To incorporate any new or revised Federal, State, or Local
Pretreatment Standards or requirements;
      (2)   To address significant alterations or additions to the discharger’s
operation, processes, or wastewater volume or characteristics since the time of
the individual wastewater discharge permit issuance;
      (3)   A change in the POTW that requires either a temporary or permanent
reduction or elimination of the authorized discharge;
      (4)   Information indicating that the permitted discharge poses a threat
to the City of St. Marys, POTW, personnel, or the receiving waters;

new owner or operator where requested.
   (jj)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Transfer.  Individual
wastewater discharge permits may be transferred to a new owner or operator only
if the permittee gives at least thirty (30) days advance notice to the Approval
Authority and the Approval Authority approves the individual wastewater
discharge permit transfers.  The notice to the Approval Authority must include
a written certification by the new owner or operator which:
      (1)   States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent
to change the facility’s operations and processes;
      (2)   Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
      (3)   Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing
individual wastewater discharge permit.
   Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the individual
wastewater discharge permit void as of the date of the facility transfer.
   (kk)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Revocation.  The Approval
Authority may revoke an individual wastewater discharge permit for good cause,
including, but not limited to, the following reasons:
      (1)   Failure to notify the approval authority of significant changes to
the wastewater prior to the changed discharge;
      (2)   Failure to provide prior notification to Approval Authority of
changed conditions pursuant to this ordinance;
      (3)   Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts
in the wastewater discharge permit application;
      (4)   Falsifying self-monitoring reports and certification statements;
      (5)   Tampering with monitoring equipment;
      (6)   Refusing to allow the Approval Authority timely access to the
facility premises and records;
      (7)   Failure to meet effluent limitations;
      (8)   Failure to pay fines;
      (9)   Failure to pay sewer charges;
      (10)   Failure to meet compliance schedules;
      (11)   Failure to complete a baseline monitoring report or the wastewater
discharge permit application.
      (12)   Failure to provide advance notice of the transfer of business
ownership of a permitted facility;
      (13)   Violation of any Pretreatment Standards or requirement, or any
terms of the wastewater discharge permit or this ordinance.
   Individual wastewater discharge permits shall be voidable upon cessation of
operations or transfer of business ownership.  All individual wastewater
discharge permit issued to a discharger are void upon the issuance of a new
individual wastewater discharge permit to that discharger.
   (ll)   Individual Wastewater Discharge Permit Reissuance.  A discharger with
an expiring individual wastewater discharge permit shall apply for an
individual wastewater discharge permit reissuance by submitting a complete
Baseline Monitoring Report a minimum of thirty (30) days prior to the
expiration of the discharger’s existing individual wastewater discharge permit.

   1329.01  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   (a)   The flood hazard areas of the City of St. Marys are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general
welfare:
   (b)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions
in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are
inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage
also contribute to the flood loss.
(Ord. 98-41.  Passed 8-10-98.)
   1329.02  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 98-41.  Passed 8-10-98.)
   1329.03  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage;
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas.

   1329.05  LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within the
jurisdiction of the City of St. Marys, Ohio, as identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, including any additional flood hazard areas
annexed by the City of St. Marys that are not identified on the effective Flood
Insurance Rate Map. 
(Ord. 98-41.  Passed 8-10-98.)
   1329.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   The areas of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled
"Flood Insurance Study for Auglaize County, Ohio, and Incorporated Areas". This
study, with accompanying Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and/or Flood
Insurance Rate Maps dated September 6, 1989, and any revisions thereto is
hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The
Flood Insurance Study is on file at 101 E. Spring Street, St. Marys, Ohio.

   Make interpretations, where needed, as to the exact location of the
boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there
appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field
conditions). Where a map boundary and field elevations disagree, the elevations
delineated in the flood elevation profile shall prevail. The person contesting
the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal
the interpretation as provided in Section
1329.20. 
(Ord. 98-41.  Passed 8-10-98.)
   1329.20  VARIANCE PROCEDURE.
   (a)   The City of St. Marys Planning Commission as established by the City
of St. Marys shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from the
requirements of this chapter.
   (b)   The City of St. Marys Planning Commission shall hear and decide

enforcement or administration of this chapter.
   (c)   Those aggrieved by the decision of the City of St. Marys Planning
Commission or any taxpayer, may appeal such decision to the Auglaize Court of
Common Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (d)   In passing upon such applications, the City of St. Marys Planning
Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors,
standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management proaram for that area;
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and,
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (e)   Upon consideration of the factors of Section
1329.20(d),  and the purposes of this chapter, the City of St. Marys Planning
Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
   (f)   The Director of Public Service and Safety shall maintain the records
of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency upon request. 
(Ord. 98-41.  Passed 8-10-98.)
   1329.21  CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
   (a)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood  levels during the base flood discharge would result.
   (b)   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance
is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
   (c)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot one-half acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below
the base flood level, providing items in Section
1329.20(d), have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-
half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance
increases.
   (d)   Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will
not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and
the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and
design of the structure.
   (e)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
      (1)   A showing of good and sufficient cause;
      (2)   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional  hardship to the applicant; and,
      (3)   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in this chapter,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create
nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in
Section
1329.20, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
   (f)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation. 
(Ord. 98-41.  Passed 8-10-98.)
   1329.22  PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
   (a)   General Standards.  In all areas of special flood hazard the following
standards are required:
   (b)   Anchoring. 
      (1)   All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored
to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting
from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.
      (2)    All manufactured homes, not otherwise regulated by the Ohio
Revised Code pertaining to manufactured home parks, shall be anchored to
prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from
hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Methods
of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame
ties to ground anchors.
   (c)   Construction Materials and Methods. 
      (1)    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
      (2)    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and,
      (3)    All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air
conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or
located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the
components during conditions of flooding.
   (d)   Utilities.  The following standards apply to all water supply,
sanitary sewerage and waste disposal systems not otherwise regulated by the
Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)    All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems;
      (2)    New and replacement sanitary sewerage systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharge from the systems into flood waters; and,
      (3)    On site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
   (e)   Subdivision Proposals. 
      (1)    All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
      (2)    All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas,
electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
      (3)    All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood
damage; and,
      (4)    All subdivision proposals, including manufactured home
subdivisions, shall meet the specific standards of subsection (i) hereof.
   (f)   Specific Standards.  In all areas of special flood hazard where base
flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in Section
1329.06; Section
1329.16; or subsection (j) hereof, the following provisions are required:
      (1)   Residential construction.  New construction and substantial
improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including
basement, elevated to the base flood elevation.
      (2)   Non-residential construction.  New construction and substantial
improvement of any commercial, industrial or other non-residential structure
shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level
of the base flood elevation; or, together with attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall:
         A.   Be flood proofed so that the structure is watertight with walls
substantially impermeable to the passage of water to the level of the base
flood elevation. In order to be eligible for lower flood insurance rates, the
structure should be flood proofed at lease one foot above the base flood
elevation.
         B.   Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and,
         C.   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted
standards of practice for meeting the standards of this subsection. Such
certification shall be provided to the official as set forth in Section
1329.12(c).
   (g)   Accessory Structures.  A relief to the elevation or dry flood proofing
standards may be granted for accessory structures (e.g., sheds, detached
garages) containing 576 square feet or less in gross floor area. Such
structures must meet the encroachment provisions of subsections (k)(1) hereof
and the following additional standards:
      (1)   They shall not be used for human habitation;
      (2)   They shall be designed to have low flood damage potential;
      (3)   They shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to
offer the minimum resistance to the flow of flood waters;
      (4)   They shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation; and,
      (5)   Service facilities such as electrical and heating equipment shall
be elevated or flood proofed.
   (h)   Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.  The following standards
shall apply to all new and substantially improved manufactured homes not
subject to the manufactured home requirements of Section 3733.01, Ohio Revised
Code:
      (1)   Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with subsection
(b) hereof.
      (2)    Manufactured homes shall be elevated on a permanent foundation
such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at the base flood
elevation.
   These standards also apply to recreational vehicles that are either located
on sites for 180 days or more, or  are not fully licensed and ready for highway
use.
   (i)   Enclosures Below the Lowest Floor.  The following standards apply to
all new and substantially improved residential and nonresidential structures
which are elevated to the base flood elevation using pilings, columns, or
posts. Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are useable solely for
parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a
basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry
and exit of flood waters. Designs for meeting this requirement must:
      (1)   Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect;
or,
      (2)    Must meet or exceed the following criteria:
         A.   A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less
than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding
shall be provided; and,
         B.   The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above
grade.  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other
openings provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of flood
waters.
   (j)   Subdivision and Large Developments.    In all areas of special flood
hazard where base flood elevation data have not been provided in accordance
with Section
1329.06 or Section
1329.16, the following standards apply to all subdivision proposals, including
manufactured home subdivisions, and other proposed developments containing at
least 50 lots or 5 acres (whichever is less):
      (1)   The applicant shall provide base flood elevation data performed in
accordance with standard engineering practices.
      (2)    If (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of subsections (a) and (e) hereof.
   (k)   Floodways.
      (1)   Areas with floodways.  The Flood Plain Management Study dated July,
1992, completed by the Soil Conservation Service referenced in Section
1329.06, identifies a segment within areas of special flood hazard known as a
floodway. Flood ways may also be delineated in other sources of flood
information as specified in Section
1329.16.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential.
The following provisions apply within all delineated floodway areas:
         A.   Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis performed in accordance with standard engineering practices
demonstrates that the proposed encroachment would not result in any increase in
flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.
         B.   If subsection (k)(1)A.,  above is satisfied, all new construction
and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard
reduction provisions of subsection (e) hereof.
         C.   Any encroachment within the floodway that would result in an
increase in base flood elevations can only be granted upon the prior approval
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Such requests must be submitted by
the Director of Public Service and Safety to the Federal Emergency Management
Agency and must meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
      (2)   Areas without floodways.  In all areas of special flood hazard
where FEMA has provided base flood elevation data as set forth in Section
1329.06, but FEMA has not delineated a floodway, the following provisions
apply:
         A.   New construction, substantial improvements, or other development
(including fill) shall only be permitted if it is demonstrated that the
cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than 1 (one) foot at any point.
         B.   If (1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions
of this section.

dollars ($400.00) for the first year the building remains vacant. For every
consecutive year that the building remains vacant, the annual registration fee
shall be assessed at double the previous year's registration fee amount for a

six thousand four hundred dollars ($6,400) which shall be the registration fee
for the fifth and all consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
   (d)    The registration fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of
any building permits. The Fire Chief shall refund the vacant commercial or
industrial building registration fee paid if the subject building is brought
into compliance with standards of the Ohio Building Code and re-occupied within

amount of the registration fee paid during the year in which the building was
approved for re-occupancy. Registration fees paid in previous years shall not
be refunded.

the County Auditor. In addition to the registration fee, an interest rate equal
to the current rate of interest charged by the City on special assessments
shall be imposed by the City for the life of the registration fee, added to the
registration fee, and collected as provided in this section. The City Auditor
shall then certify the amount of the registration fee, including interest, to
the County Auditor. The County Auditor shall enter the amount on the tax
duplicate of the County as a special assessment against the person's real
estate that is subject to the registration fee.  (Ord.  2019-27.  Passed 11-11-

GENERAL REGULATIONS
Section 100 Title, Purpose, and Area of Jurisdiction
1. For purpose of reference and citation, these regulations shall be known as the Zoning Ordinance of the City of St. Marys, Ohio, and may be referred to as “This Zoning Ordinance”.
2. This Zoning Ordinance has been developed in accordance with the representatives of the City of St. Marys and the goals and objectives of the City of St. Marys Comprehensive Plan, and is designed and intended to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the city, to encourage sound and orderly growth, and to protect existing development through the conservation of property values. To that end, all provisions, standards and/or regulations contained in this Ordinance shall be considered to be minimum requirements that shall be met and that may be exceeded. Wherever there are any other laws, municipal ordinances which impose a greater or lesser restriction upon property owners relative to land use, lands, buildings or area characteristics, the greater restriction shall control.
3. In order that sound development be maintained, and that growth may occur in an orderly fashion, this Zoning Ordinance is hereby adopted by the City Council of St. Marys, Ohio, as of this date, 9th day of July, 1979 .
4. The entire land area within the corporate limits of the City of St. Marys, Ohio, is subject to the provisions specified in this Zoning Ordinance.
Section 110 Map and Text Interpretation
1. Official Zoning District Map
a. Where definite distances are not shown in feet on the Official Zoning District Map, the District Boundaries are intended to follow lot lines or extensions thereof, the center lines of existing street, alleys and highway right-of-way lines, railroads and bodies of water. If the exact location of such lines is not clear, it shall be determined by either supplemental detail drawings or rules of interpretation, adopted by the concurring vote of four (4) members of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
b. When the actual locations of streets or alleys on the ground differ from the streets or alleys on the Official Zoning District Map, the Board of Zoning Appeals may apply the Zoning District designations on the map to the property on the ground in such manner as to conform to the intent and purposes of this Section in the judgment of said Board.
1
Section 110 (con’t.)
c. Whenever any street, alley, railroad right-of-way, or other public way is vacated by official action of the Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street, alley, railroad right-of-way, or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such vacation and all area included in the vacation shall then and thenceforth be subject to all appropriate regulations of the extended districts. In the event of a partial vacation, the adjoining district, or district nearest the portion vacated, shall be extended automatically to include all the vacated area.
d. Wherever lands are incorporated into the City of St. Marys, Ohio, through annexation, they shall retain the township zoning designation and the City shall enforce the township zoning regulations until zoned by the City Council under the terms of these regulations.
2. Text
In the construction of the Zoning Ordinance text, the rules of interpretation contained in this Section shall be observed and applied, except when the context clearly indicates otherwise. The following rules of construction apply to the text:
a. The particular shall control the general.
b. Where there is any difference of meaning or implication between the text and any caption of illustration, the text shall control.
c. The word “shall” shall be mandatory and not discretionary. The word “may” shall be permissive.
d. Words used in the present tense shall include the future; and words used in the singular number shall include the plural, and the plural the singular, unless the context clearly indicates the contrary.
e. The phrase “used for” includes “arranged for”, “designed for”, “intended for”, “maintained for”, or “occupied for”.
2
Section 120 Pre-Existing Lots of Record
1. In any zoning district in which single-family detached dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory dwelling may be erected on any lot of record which existed at the time of adoption of the 1954 Zoning Ordinance, even though the lot does not meet the required minimum frontage or lot size for the district in which it is located. Said lots must not be identical ownership with that of any adjoining property. When a dwelling is constructed on said pre-existing lot, the side, front, and rear yard requirements of the applicable district shall be enforced. Variance of specified yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Appeals, as outlined in Section 430.
Section 130 Non-Conformities: Uses, Buildings, and Lands
1. Any legal use, building, structure, or lot which existed prior to the adoption of the 1954 Zoning Ordinance, and which is further restricted or prohibited by this Ordinance, may be continued as a non-conforming use, subject to the conditions specified herein.
2. Conditionally Permitted Uses Not Considered Non-Conforming Uses
Any use of a specific property which is conditionally permitted in a zoning district in accordance with the provisions of this Ordinance shall not be considered as a non-conforming use n the zoning district in which it is conditionally permitted. Such conditionally permitted use shall be considered a conforming use on the particular lot on which it is located.
3. All non-conforming buildings, structures or uses of land which were lawfully existing prior to the adoption of this Ordinance may be maintained and kept in repair providing no further enlargement of the non-conformance shall occur.
4. Any non-conforming building, structure or use of land which is superseded by a use which is permitted within the zoning district in which it is located shall thereafter be in conformance with this Ordinance, and the previous non-conforming use shall not be resumed.
5. A non-conforming building or structure shall not be moved, in whole or in part, to any other location on the lot on which it is located unless it is made to conform with all of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
6. Any building, structure or use of land which is devoted to a use which is not permitted by this Ordinance in the zoning district in which it is located shall not be extended, enlarged, constructed, restored, reconstructed, moved or structurally altered except as to change its use to a use which is permitted and in conformance with the regulations of this Ordinance, except as hereinafter provided:
3
Section 130 (con’t.)
a. A residential non-conforming use located in any commercial district may be restored or reconstructed following any destruction, one (1) time after the date of adoption of this Ordinance, subject to the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of St. Marys, Ohio.
An addition to an existing residence or the construction of an attached or unattached garage or accessory building shall be permitted, if said, meets required setbacks, without being subject to the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals. (2)
b. A residential non-conforming use of land located in any “R” District may be restored or reconstructed following any destruction, one (1) time after the date of adoption of this Ordinance, subject to the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of St. Marys, Ohio.
c. A non-conforming use or building may be expanded an additional 50% of the area as it exists at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance; however, no expansion shall exceed 100% of the area as the area lawfully existed at the time that it first became non-conforming. Such expansion may occur only one time after the effective date of this Ordinance, and subject to the approval of the Board of Appeals in accordance with Section 440. (1)
7. Nothing contained in this Ordinance shall be construed to require any changes to be made in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building, structure or use on which actual construction was lawfully begun, or for which plans were officially approved by the City of St. Marys, Ohio, prior to the date of adoption of this Ordinance. Actual construction includes projects already under construction, whereby materials have been placed on the site and fastened together in a permanent manner; where excavation of a site has begun; or where demolition of a building to make way for rebuilding has begun, provided said construction, excavation, or demolition and subsequent rebuilding shall be carried on diligently. Officially approved plans shall include preliminary and final subdivision plans which have been approved by the City of St. Marys prior to the adoption of this Ordinance.
8. Any non-conforming use, building, or structure which has been discontinued for a period of 24 consecutive months, or any non-conforming use of land which has been discontinued for a period of 180 consecutive days, shall not be recontinued or reestablished unless it is made to conform with all of the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.
9. No non-conforming use, building, or structure can be replaced with a non-conforming use which is non-conforming to a lesser degree. A second non-conforming use cannot be added to a building or structure which is non-conforming.

5
Section 140 (con’t.)
4. Zoning District Statements of Intent
a. R-1 Single-Family Residential District
The R-1 District designates lands for single-family homes at medium density levels. In places, this designation reflects existing development; in other parts of the City, it may reflect sites for potential infill on existing lots of record. In addition, the R-1 designation encompasses currently undeveloped areas which are contiguous to built-up housing and are appropriate for new residential development and housing in the medium density range.
b. R-2 Single-Family Residential District
The R-2 District reserves certain land areas for medium size lots on which detached single-family and detached two-family dwellings may be built. In other cases, the designation may be used to provide for development of new area at comparable low density levels. These areas should be contiguous to existing built-up portions of the City.
c. R-3 Single-Family Residential District
The R-3 District designates lands for pre-existing single-family homes on small lots of record. This District is intended solely to reflect existing high density single-family residential development and to allow for limited infilling within this one particular residential section of the City.
d. R-4 Single-Family Residential District
The R-4 District applies to existing single-family neighborhoods which have developed at extremely high density levels.
e. R-5 Multi-Family Residential Development District
The R-5 District is intended to provide for areas of multi-family housing at strategic locations where high density housing is appropriate due to access to major thoroughfares and/or commercial areas. R-5 Districts may also be used as “buffer” or transition zone between areas of lower-density residential development and housing and business or industry.
f. R-PUD Residential Planned Unit Development District
The R-PUD District establishes a permissive, flexible zoning procedure for the development housing areas containing a “mix of” house types and/or residential densities. Development of a “PUD” proceeds according to an overall development plan, which has been determined through a specified procedure involving site plan review-and-approval. Usable open space shall be provided as part of the planned unit development.
6
Section 140 (con’t.)
g. R-MHP Residential Mobile Home Park District
The R-MHP District is intended to provide for the placement of mobile homes in a pre-planned physical setting which site is under unified management and ownership and which contains communal facilities (e.g., laundry and recreation facilities). Approved connections to municipal utility systems shall be required.
h. C-1 Central Business District Commercial
The “CBD” commercial zoning district reflects the historic built-up commercial-office-government center of the community. The intent is to encompass the existing commercial center and to allow for modest expansion where this is both physically possible and commercially feasible.
i. C-2 General Commercial District
The intent of the C-2 District is to provide for extensive commercial uses (which require large lots for display and storage) plus highway commercial uses which require substantial frontage for both good visibility and access. In either case, the C-2 District accommodates those commercial establishments which derive a significant part of their trade from areas beyond the immediate neighborhood and, in many instances, beyond the City and/or County.
j. C-3 Office-Medical Facilities District
The C-3 District is intended to designate land around the Joint Township District Memorial Hospital for the purpose of allowing both general offices, medical-related offices and medical-related facilities to locate in close proximity to this Hospital complex.
k. C-4 Neighborhood Commercial District
The intent of the C-4 District is to establish small, compact commercial districts at strategic locations near or adjacent the City’s residential neighborhoods in order to provide land for convenience, commercial uses, and personal service establishments at locations where they can be easily used by residents of nearby neighborhoods on a day-to-day basis.
l. I-1 General Industrial District
The intent of the I-1 District is to accommodate existing industrial development and allow land for its future expansion and secondly, to provide land for new industrial sites. The I-1 designation is for lands which are located with frontage along major thoroughfares and/or where convenient access exists to major highways and/or rail systems. These industrial districts should be preferably separated physically and functionally from the City’s residential neighborhoods.
m. I-2 Light Industrial District
The intent of the I-2 District is to provide for light industrial/heavy commercial uses and locations which are suitable and appropriate, taking into consideration that it shall be located next to a residential or commercial zone.
It is not intended to allow a use which would impose hazards or a nuisance to adjacent or other
properties by reason of smoke, soot, odor, noise, glare, fumes, or other conditions that would
adversely affect the public health, safety, and welfare.
7
Section 140 (con’t.)
n. S-FP Flood Plain District
The intent of the S-FP District is to protect flood prone areas along the St. Marys River and its tributary streams from encroachment by urban development (land uses) which would interfere with flood flows and be subject to damage. The purpose underlying the prohibition of certain land uses is to protect human life and private property and to preserve the natural/scenic values of the flood plain.
o. RP-1 Residential-Professional District
The RP-1 District designates land primarily single-family residential areas which are located along major thoroughfares. The District shall allow for the establishment of a professional office or studio in a single-family residential structure. These areas are intended to serve as a buffer between existing residential areas and existing commercial areas in the City.
8
