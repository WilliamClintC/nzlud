Article XVII. Local Assessments and Real Property
Editor's Note: See also Ch. 224, Taxation.
§ C17-00.
The City Assessor, the City Engineer and the City Attorney shall compose a Board to be called the
"Board of Local Assessors," which Board shall make all local assessments and perform all the duties
required by this Charter to be performed in regard to the making of local assessments and without
extra compensation thereof. The City Assessor shall be Chairman of the Board of Local Assessors and
shall prepare all rolls and copies of rolls of said local assessments. All local assessments of the
expense, or any portion thereof, of any improvements authorized by this Charter to be made shall be
made by the Board of Local Assessors or a majority thereof.
§ C17-01.
Said Board of Local Assessors shall meet at the office of the Assessor as soon as practicable after any
local assessment is ordered, and may, if necessary, adjourn from time to time. They shall make an
assessment roll of said local assessments in which they shall set down, in separate columns and
according to the best information obtainable by them, the names of all the owners or occupants of the
land assessed, the number of the block and lot and the number of the great lot, if any, or the
Assessor's subdivision thereof on which the land described and to be assessed is situated; a brief
description of the land to be taxed to each person, giving the quantity thereof where the land is farming
land and also, where practicable, the street and the number of any building thereon; but if the land be
vacant or the building thereon not numbered, then the name of the street or streets on which it fronts
shall be given and the amount of the expense of such local improvement assessed on each piece of
property apportioned as equitably as may be. When such roll is finished, they shall publish a notice in
the official paper for five days of a time when they will meet, at the expiration of said five days, to
review such assessment, and shall designate the Assessors' office as the place where such review will
be made and where said roll may be seen and examined by any person interested therein. They shall
have the same power to make corrections in such assessment rolls as the Assessor has in the case of
the assessment of the general tax. After such review of said assessment roll, they shall complete the
same and shall deliver a correct copy of the roll, duly certified, signed by all or a majority of said Board
to the City Clerk within 20 days after their first meeting.
§ C17-02.
Any person interested may appeal to the Common Council for the correction of such assessment.
Such appeal shall be in writing, stating in detail the grounds for such appeal and shall be delivered to
the Clerk of the City within 10 days after the corrected copy of said assessment roll is delivered to the
City Clerk. If there is no appeal, the assessment roll shall be confirmed by the Common Council. In
case of an appeal, the Common Council shall appoint a time within 10 days thereafter for a hearing of
such appeal and shall cause a notice thereof to be published in the official paper for three successive
times prior to the date of such hearing. After such hearing, the Common Council shall have power to
correct such assessment or to annul the same and direct a new assessment to be made in the manner
7/14/2020 City of Oswego, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/OS0092?guid=OS0092&children=true 34/568
hereinbefore directed, which shall be final and conclusive on all parties interested, in case the
Common Council confirms the same. If the Common Council shall set aside the last aforesaid
assessment, all the proceedings in the matter shall be null and void. A second assessment shall be
made, and an appeal thereon may be taken in the same manner as on the first assessment. If no
appeal be taken from any such assessment, it shall be confirmed.
§ C17-03.
As soon as the Common Council has confirmed an assessment roll for any local assessment, it shall
cause a warrant to be annexed under the hand and seal of the Mayor commanding the City
Chamberlain to collect from the several persons named or property described in said assessment roll
the several sums levied in said roll, and said roll, with the warrant so annexed, shall be delivered to the
City Chamberlain. The City Chamberlain shall thereupon proceed to collect the several sums levied
and assessed in said local assessment roll in the same manner as in the case of the general city
assessment rolls. All of the provisions of this Charter relative to the collecting of the general city
assessments and the sale of lands for nonpayment of such assessments shall apply to any such local
assessment roll, except so far as the same are modified by the provisions of this Charter.
§ C17-04.
Two-thirds of the entire cost of paving, repaving, surfacing and/or resurfacing any streets or section of
a street or highway shall be assessed upon all the real estate fronting thereupon in proportion to the
frontage of the respective parcels thereof, and the remaining 1/3 of such cost shall be borne by the city
and shall be defrayed by a general tax.
§ C17-05.
Before ordering any local improvement subject to local assessment, the Department of Public Works
shall give public notice that application has been made to it for such local improvement, or that it
proposes to order the same, by publication for five (5) days in the official papers, fixing a day after the
last publication of said notice for hearing objections to such improvement. On the day fixed for such
hearing, persons interested in such improvement may appear before said Department and present
objections thereto.
§ C17-06.
If the Department shall finally determine, notwithstanding objections, to order such improvement, it
shall make an order accordingly, which shall be entered at length in its proceedings, stating the
estimated cost and giving a general description of the proposed improvement and shall certify the
same to the Common Council, who shall order said improvement to be made; provided, however, that
no pavement shall be so ordered if the owners of a majority of the frontage liable to assessment
therefor shall file a protest, in writing, against the proposed improvement, unless and until the Common
Council, by a vote of at least a majority of its members, shall adopt a resolution favoring the proposed
improvement. The mortgagee, if any, on any property affected by the proposed improvement shall be
considered a party in interest and must join with the mortgagor in affirmative or negative action, both to
be considered as one (1) interested party. Upon and in the event that the Common Council shall adopt
such resolution, the Department shall have the power to order such improvement. The evidence of the
liability of the petitioners to be so assessed shall be the certificate of the Assessor endorsed upon said
petition. Upon the completion of such improvement, the Department of Public Works shall certify to the
Common Council the whole cost thereof, which cost shall not include any charge for the use of any
city-owned machinery or equipment, but shall include the cost of operation thereof, and of all labor,
material and supplies actually consumed in the construction of the proposed improvement and the
7/14/2020 City of Oswego, NY Ecode360
https://ecode360.com/print/OS0092?guid=OS0092&children=true 35/568
amount of cost to be paid by local assessment; upon presentation of such certified order to the
Common Council, it shall be the duty of said Council and it shall, within thirty (30) days from the receipt
of such certified order, direct the Board of Local Assessors to make a local assessment for the cost of
said improvement as certified, and the Assessor shall thereupon proceed to make such local
assessment as by this Charter prescribed.
§ C17-07.
The Department of Public Works may, at any time after the assessment for any local improvement is
confirmed by the Common Council, commence the work on such proposed improvements. Said
assessments, when finally made, shall be confirmed by the Common Council, which confirmation shall
be presumptive evidence of the regulatory of all proceedings taken thereon.
§ C17-08.
Neither the Department of Public Works nor the Common Council shall order any local improvements
when the cost thereof, as determined by the Department of Public Works and the City Engineer, shall
exceed fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.), unless a majority of the owners of the property liable to
assessment therefor or the owners of one-half (1/2) in value of the property affected thereby, shall
petition, in writing, to said Department of Public Works or the Common Council for such local
improvement or consent thereto, in writing. The mortgagee, if any, on any property affected by the
proposed improvement shall be considered a party in interest and must join with the mortgagor in
affirmative or negative action both to be considered as one (1) interested party. This section does not
apply to any local improvement ordered by the Department of Public Works or the Common Council,
any portion of the expense of which is to be defrayed from moneys raised or to be raised by virtue of a
special election, according to the provisions of this Charter.
§ C17-09.
The grades of the several streets within said city determined by the Department of Public Works are
hereby declared to be the established grades of said several streets respectively. Whenever the
established grade of any street, lane, alley or other highway shall be altered by the Department of
Public Works under the provisions of this Charter, the owner of any lot or house upon such street, lane,
alley or other highway may claim damages therefor and present his claim to the Common Council, and
the Common Council shall thereupon direct the Board of Local Assessors to ascertain such damages
and assess the same as herein provided upon the real estate benefited by said alteration.
§ C17-10.
Whenever the Board of Local Assessors shall be of the opinion that any owner or owners of land on
any street, lane, alley or highway to be graded or leveled will sustain damages over and above the
benefit which may accrue to said owner or owners of such land by such improvements, they may
assess such an amount as they may deem a reasonable recompense to such owner or owners thereof
upon the real estate benefited by such improvement, in proportion to the benefit resulting thereto, as
nearly as may be, and said assessors may add said amount to the assessment roll which they are
hereby required to make and certify the same amount to the Common Council at the time of delivering
their roll to the City Clerk, as aforesaid.
§ C17-11.

A.
B.
In case any assessment shall prove insufficient to defray the expenses of be improvement for which it
was made, the Common Council may direct the Board of Local Assessors to make a further
assessment for the amount of the deficiency; such further assessment shall be founded on the first roll
and the like proceedings shall be had thereon as though it were an original assessment. If, on any
assessment, too large an amount shall be raised, the excess shall be refunded ratably to those from
whom it was collected.
§ C17-12.
Any and all property within the City of Oswego shall bear its proportionate share of all taxes levied,
including those for local improvements, except when specifically exempted by law.
§ C17-13.
The Common Council may, when ordering any local assessment pursuant to this Charter or at any
time thereafter and before the issue of the warrant to the Chamberlain for the collection thereof, order
the whole of such assessment to be collected at one (1) time or it may order such assessment to be
collected in equal annual installments, with interest added as follows: any assessment for a sewer or
sewers, sidewalk, macadamized road or curbing, when the latter is not laid with a pavement, in or upon
any of the streets, highways, alleys, lanes, walks or avenues of the city may be extended and levied
and collected in not to exceed ten (10) equal annual installments, as herein provided, and any
assessment for paving or repaving any of the streets, highways, lane, crosswalks or avenues of the
city, including all curbing or other structures incident to such paving and laid at the same time
therewith, when such pavement is not macadam, may be extended, levied and collected in not to
exceed ten (10) equal annual installments, as herein provided. The first installment of any such
extended local assessment, the warrant for the collection of which has been delivered to the
Chamberlain on or before the last day of December in any year, shall become due and payable the first
day of September following and subject to the same fees, interest and penalties as the city tax; and all
subsequent annual installments on such assessment shall become due and payable on said first day
of September, one (1) in each succeeding year and subject to the same fees, interest and penalties as
the city tax; until all the installments of any such extended tax with fees and interest thereon are fully
paid. Any person against whom any local assessment may be levied and taxed may pay any part of
any such assessment or installment thereof at any time prior to the due date thereof to the City
Chamberlain and receive a receipt therefor and failure to pay any balance of a local assessment or
installment thereof when due shall be a default within the meaning of the term as herein provided.
Upon default of payment of any installment of any such extended assessment when the same is due
and payable as above provided, the same proceedings on said installment, including the sale of the
real estate upon which such assessment is levied, shall be taken as though said assessment had not
be extended. The whole or any part of any such extended tax or assessment may be paid at any time
with interest and fees thereon to the date of payment, as above provided.
§ C17-14. Payment; contingent fund.
Where an order is made by the Common Council to collect a local assessment by installments, as
provided in § C17-13, any person liable to pay the same may, within thirty (30) days after the first
publication by the City Chamberlain in the official paper of notice that the warrant for any such
assessment roll is placed in his hands for collection, pay to the City Chamberlain the amount of
such assessment without fee, percentage or interest thereon.
If any obligations are issued to finance an improvement, all or part of the expense of which is to be
borne by the property benefited by such improvement, the portion of such obligations which is to
be redeemed from such assessments shall be credited to the contingent fund of the city. All
moneys collected upon the payment of installments of any such local assessments as herein
provided in any year shall be applied by the Chamberlain to the payment of the expense of such

pay his, her or its tax without any additional charges. During the next succeeding thirty (30) days oneand-
one-half-per-centum fees shall be added to the tax and collected by the City Chamberlain; and

tax and the fees herein provided for in relation to unpaid city taxes shall apply to all such local
assessments and shall be served as and in the same manner after the expiration of the second period
of thirty (30) days aforesaid, and such notice shall require payment of such taxes as then remain
unpaid to be made before the expiration of the sixty (60) days during which payment of two-and-onehalf-
per-centum fees are required, and it shall not be necessary to make any other demand of payment
of said taxes.
§ C17-17.
All local taxes and assessments imposed for any purpose by the Common Council under any provision
of this Charter shall be and remain liens upon the real estate upon which they are assessed from the
time when the respective taxes or assessments shall have been confirmed by the Common Council to
the same extent and with the same effect as the general annual tax of said city, viz., six (6) years. If
any such taxes or assessments or any part thereof shall be returned as unpaid by any officer
authorized to collect the same, such premises assessed shall be sold in the manner provided in this
Charter for the sale of lands for unpaid city taxes. And in case any such taxes or assessments are
extended for a period of years in accordance with the provisions of this Charter, the same shall be and
remain a lien upon the several parcels of real estate upon which such taxes or assessments are made,
for the amount due each year, for a period aforesaid, from and after the time when each such portion
of said taxes or assessment are due and payable; provided, however, that in case default shall be
made in the payment of an installment of such taxes or assessments, as the same becomes due, then
and in that event all the unpaid balance of said taxes or assessments shall be and become a lien from
and after the date of said default. The Common Council is hereby required to add to the amount and
include in the roll of any such local taxes or assessments, as ascertained by them under their authority,

All sums herein authorized to be raised shall be fixed on or before the 20th day of December in each
year. The Common Council shall annually cause to be made up and published with its proceedings an
estimate in detail, under appropriate heads, of the expenditures of the city in the various departments
of the government thereof for the current fiscal year, together with a statement of all receipts and
probable income of the city during the same period.
§ C18-11.
The tax so directed to be raised shall be assessed upon all the taxable real and personal property in
the city, according to the valuation of the same on the assessment rolls of the current year, filed by the
City Assessor after said rolls shall be corrected as herein provided for.
§ C18-12.
The sum rated and assessed upon the property of each person, company, corporation and association
shall be set opposite the name of such person, company, corporation or association respectively and

same to the City Chamberlain on or before the first day of March in each year. The City Chamberlain
shall extend the total tax levied against each separate assessment and compute the amount due in
two (2) equal installments. The tax can then be paid either in its entirety or in equal installments as
provided by § C17-13 of this Charter. The City Chamberlain shall cause a notice to be published in the
official paper that the same has been left with him to collect on or after the first day of April. Every such
tax or assessment, for whatever purpose imposed, charged upon any real estate within the city by
virtue of any provision of this Charter, shall be a lien upon the real estate so charged from the time of
the confirmation thereof by the Common Council, except as otherwise provided in this Charter.
§ C18-13.
In case any taxable land in said city has been omitted in the tax or assessment rolls of said city for any

year, in addition to its share of the tax or assessment for such year, the proportion of the taxes or
assessments it should have borne in such preceding years, stating such additional taxes or
assessments separately, and such additions shall be collected as part of the tax for the current year,
except as provided in the next section.
§ C18-14.
If the tax or assessment rolls are amended or corrected as provided by this Charter, the tax or
assessment as inserted in the tax or assessment rolls for the current year shall be a lien on said real
estate and be collected in the same manner as the taxes or assessments for the current year, if the
real estate remains the property of the person or party to whom it should have been taxed or assessed
in such former rolls. But if, since said former rolls were completed, said real estate has been sold to a
bona fide purchaser not knowing that such real estate has been omitted from such former roll or rolls,
then such tax or assessment shall not be a lien upon such real estate but may be collected by the City
Chamberlain by levy on the personal property of the person or party who should have been taxed or
assessed therefor on the rolls of the prior year or years or it may be collected from such person or
party, or his or her personal representative, by action in the name of the city, with costs of the suit.

be just and equitable, and the remainder of the sum so taxed, together with the interest and charges,
shall be a lien upon the residue of the land and premises only, which residue may be sold to satisfy the

been imposed upon the residue of said lands or premises.
§ C18-16.

each year. To each of such assessment rolls so to be delivered to the City Chamberlain, as aforesaid,

Chamberlain to collect from the several persons named in the assessment rolls the several sums
levied as taxes in the columns of said rolls, according to the provisions of this Charter. Said
assessment rolls, with the warrants attached, shall be delivered to the City Chamberlain on or before
the 18th day of March, but the collection of said taxes shall not be commenced until the first day of

and hold and apply the same on any defaulted tax or taxes levied or assessed against such
taxpayer or against property owned by him in form and manner prescribed by such resolution or
ordinance.
The City Chamberlain may also in his discretion, when authorized by the Common Council,
receive deposits on account of any defaulted water rate or rates charge or charges owed by any
water user or any owner of property to which water has been supplied, in weekly, semimonthly or
monthly installments of not less than one dollar ($1.), and hold and apply the same on such
defaulted water rate or rates charge or charges in form and manner prescribed by resolution or
ordinance enacted by the Common Council. Upon execution and delivery of a written agreement
to pay and discharge defaulted water rates and charges by installment payments and the
acceptance thereof by the City Chamberlain, the Department of Water, provided that current and
future water rates and charges are paid and discharged as they fall and become due, is hereby
authorized and empowered, notwithstanding the existence of such defaulted water rates and
charges, to continue to furnish and supply water to any such user or owner as long as such user

next succeeding due date of payment, a list of all such unpaid city taxes on all rolls, including the rolls
for local assessments, shall thereupon be delivered by the City Chamberlain to the Assessor of the
city, and he shall immediately review such assessments and correct all errors of every description
which may have been made either in the original assessments or subsequent proceedings, and shall

moneys received by the City Chamberlain shall forthwith be paid by him into the treasury of the city for
the use of the city.

For purposes of this section, a "gift" includes anything of value, whether in the form of money,

a gift is the gift's fair market value, determined by the retail cost of the item or a comparable item.

other benefit is the face value of the ticket, or the actual cost to the donor, whichever is greater.

together the value of all gifts received from the donor by an officer or employee during the twelvemonth
period preceding the receipt of the most recent gift.
A gift to a municipal officer or employee is presumed to be intended to influence the exercise
or performance of his or her official powers or duties when the gift is from a private person or
organization that seeks municipal action involving the exercise of discretion by or with the
participation of the officer or employee.
A gift to a municipal officer or employee is presumed to be intended as a reward for official
action when the gift is from a private person or organization that has obtained municipal
action involving the exercise of discretion by or with the participation of the officer or
employee during the preceding 12 months.
This section does not prohibit any other gift, including:
Gifts made to the municipality;
Gifts from a person with a family or personal relationship with the officer or employee when
the circumstances make it clear that the personal relationship, rather than the recipient's
status as a municipal officer or employee, is the primary motivating factor for the gift;
Gifts given on special occasions, such as marriage, illness, or retirement, which are modest,
reasonable and customary;
Unsolicited advertising or promotional material of little intrinsic value, such as pens, pencils,
note pads, and calendars;

§ 40-13. Approval of plats.
The Planning Board is hereby authorized and empowered to approve plats showing lots, blocks or

by the Planning Board, which hearing shall be advertised at least once in the official paper at least five
(5) days before such hearing. The Planning Board may thereupon approve, modify and approve or
disapprove such plat. Such approval or refusal to approve shall take place within forty-five (45) days

Editor's Note: Amended at time of adoption of Code; see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 40-14. Approval of plats; additional requisites.
Before the approval by the Planning Board of a plat showing lots, blocks or sites, with or without
streets or highways, such plat shall also show, in proper cases and when required by the Planning
Board, a park or parks suitably located for playground or other recreation purposes. In the event that
the Planning Board finds that the plat presents a proper case for requiring a park or parks suitably
located for playgrounds or other recreational purposes, but that a suitable park or parks of adequate
size to meet the requirement cannot be properly located on such plat, the Planning Board may require
a sum of money in lieu thereof, in an amount to be established by the Common Council, in accordance
with § 33 of the General City Law. In approving such plat, the Planning Board shall require that the
streets and highways shall be of sufficient width and suitable grade and shall be suitably located to
accommodate the prospective traffic, to afford adequate light and air, to facilitate fire protection and to
provide access of fire-fighting equipment to buildings and to be coordinated so as to compose a
convenient system conforming to the Official Map, if one be adopted and established, and properly
related to the proposals shown by the Planning Board on the Master Plan; that the land shown on such
plats shall be of such a character that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to
health or peril from fire, flood or other menace; that suitable monuments have been placed at such
block corners and other necessary points as may be required by the Planning Board, and the location
thereof is shown on the map of such plat; and that the parks shall be of reasonable size for

neighborhood playgrounds or other recreation uses; that all streets or other public places shown on
such plats shall be suitably graded and paved and that sidewalks, street lighting standards, curbs,
gutters, street trees, water mains, sanitary sewers, fire-alarm cables and necessary ducts, fire signal
boxes and storm drains or combined sewers shall be installed, all in accordance with standards,
specifications and procedure acceptable to the appropriate departments of the City of Oswego; or
alternatively that a performance bond sufficient to cover the full cost of the same as estimated by the
Planning Board or other appropriate city departments designated by the Planning Board shall be
furnished to the city by the owner; provided, however, that the Planning Board may waive, subject to
appropriate conditions and guarantees of such period as it may determine, the provision of any or all
such improvements as in its judgment of the special circumstances of a particular plat or plats are not
requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare. Such performance bond shall
be issued by a bonding or surety company approved by the City Attorney or by the owner with security
acceptable to the Common Council and shall also be approved by the City Attorney as to form,
sufficiency and manner of execution. Such performance bond shall run for a term to be fixed by the
Planning Board, but in no case for a longer term than three (3) years; provided, however, that the term
of such performance bond may be extended by the Planning Board with the consent of the parties
thereto. If the Planning Board shall decide at any time during the term of the performance bond that the
extent of building development that has taken place in the subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the
improvements covered by such performance bond or that required improvements have been installed,
as provided in this section, and by the Planning Board in sufficient amount to warrant reduction in the
face amount of said bond or that the character and extent of such development requires additional
improvements previously waived for a period stated at the time of fixing the original terms of such
bond, the Planning Board may modify its requirements for any or all such improvements, and the face
value of such performance bond shall thereupon be reduced or increased by an appropriate amount so
that the new face value will cover the cost in full of the amended list of improvements required by the
Planning Board and any security deposited with the bond may be reduced or increased
proportionately. In the event that any required improvements have not been installed as provided in
this section within the term of such performance bond, the Common Council may thereupon declare
said bond to be in default and collect the sum remaining payable thereunder and, upon receipt of the
proceeds thereof, the city shall install such improvements as are covered by such performance bond
and are commensurate with the extent of building development that has taken place in the subdivision,
but not exceeding in cost the amount of such proceeds. In making such determination regarding
streets, highways, parks and required improvement, the Planning Board shall take into consideration
the prospective character of the development, whether dense residence, open residence, business or
industrial.

§ 40-15. Changes in zoning regulations.
The Planning Board is hereby empowered simultaneously with the approval of any such plat either
to confirm the zoning regulations of the land so platted as shown on the Official Zoning Maps of
the City of Oswego or to make any reasonable change therein, and such Board is hereby
empowered to make such change. The owner of the land shown on the plat may submit with the
plat a proposed building plan indicating lots where group houses for residences or apartment
houses or local stores and shops are proposed to be built; such building shall indicate for each lot
or proposed building unit the maximum density of population that may exist thereon and the
minimum yard requirements. Such plan, if approved by the Planning Board, shall modify, change
or supplement the zoning regulations of the land shown on the plat within the limitations
prescribed herein; provided, however, that for such land so shown there shall not be a greater
average density of population or cover of the land with buildings than is permitted in the district
wherein such land lies, as shown on the Official Zoning Map. Such building plan shall not be
approved by the Planning Board unless in its judgment the appropriate use of adjoining land is
reasonably safeguarded and such plan is consistent with the public welfare. Before the Board
shall make any change in the zoning regulations there shall be a public hearing preceded by the
same notice as in the case of the approval of the plat itself. On the filing of the plat in the office of
the County Clerk of the County of Oswego, such changes shall be and become part of the zoning

[HISTORY: Adopted by the Common Council of the City of Oswego 5-10-1999. Amendments noted
where applicable.]
GENERAL REFERENCES
Fire prevention and building construction  See Ch. 126.
§ 57-1. Purpose and intent.
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to protect and promote the health, safety and general
welfare of the residents of the City of Oswego by reducing the number of avoidable alarms to
emergency agencies. Avoidable alarms contribute to ineffective utilization of public safety
personnel and equipment. In addition, avoidable alarms require emergency responses which may
contribute to the potential of accidents and delayed responses to genuine emergencies. This
chapter intends to assure that police and fire communications and facilities will be available to
dispatch police and fire personnel for actual emergencies and to alleviate the nuisance of
avoidable alarms within the City of Oswego. Additionally, this chapter is intended to provide the
City of Oswego with the names of responsible individuals to contact in case of activation of an
alarm.
This chapter is enforceable for the following structures:
Assembly.
Business.
Industrial.

§ 57-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ALARM BUSINESS
Any individual, partnership, corporation or other entity engaging in the business of selling, leasing,
maintaining, servicing, repairing, altering, replacing, moving or installing any alarm system.
ALARM SYSTEM
A device or an assembly of equipment which emits a signal which is intended to alert persons
inside or outside a premises to the existence of a hazard or emergency, or which is intended to
alert emergency agencies by automatically dialing an emergency agency, or which is connected to
a private answering point for the purpose of reporting such alarms to emergency agencies, or
which is directly connected to the Fire Department, Police Department, Oswego County 911
Center or other emergency agencies. Excluded from this definition and chapter, however, is any
residential smoke, heat, combustion or carbon monoxide detectors not connected to any point
outside the premises or intended to be heard or detected outside the premises.
ALARM USER
Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, company or organization of any kind in
control of any building, structure or facility wherein an alarm system is maintained, except that,
when the alarm system is used on a motor vehicle or is a proprietary system in the City of
Oswego, then the person using such system is an alarm user.
AVOIDABLE ALARM
The activation of an alarm system, through mechanical failure, malfunction, improper installation
or the negligence of the owner, user, custodian or lessee of an alarm system or of his/her
employees or agents or through any other cause, which is a direct connection to an emergency
agency or which, through notification of the emergency by a private answering point or automatic
dialing service or a Fire Department alarm system, or through notification to an emergency agency
by a second party or means, indicates that an emergency situation exists requiring a response
within the City of Oswego, when, in fact, an emergency situation does not exist. An avoidable
alarm also includes the knowing or intentional activation of an alarm to an emergency agency
when the activator knows an emergency situation does not exist. Avoidable alarms shall not
include alarms activated by violent conditions of nature such as hurricanes, tornadoes,
earthquakes or other similar causes beyond the control of the user of an alarm system. Activation
of an alarm system under any circumstances when the activator reasonably believes that an
emergency situation exists shall not be deemed an "avoidable alarm." Anything herein contained
to the contrary notwithstanding, the defective installation of an alarm system, the failure to repair
or cause to be repaired an alarm system or the use of defective equipment in connection with an
alarm system shall not constitute extraordinary circumstances beyond reasonable control of the
alarm user.
EMERGENCY AGENCY
The Police Department and Fire Department or other law enforcement agency, ambulance
company or other agency summoned to respond to an emergency situation; and the Oswego
County 911 Center.

https://ecode360.com/print/OS0092?guid=OS0092&children=true 74/568
A.
LOCAL ALARM SYSTEM
A signaling system which when activated causes an audible signaling device to be activated
outside the premises within which the system is installed, excluding, however, any residential
smoke, heat, combustion or carbon monoxide detectors not connected to any point outside the
premises or intended to be heard or detected outside the premises.
NOTICE ADDRESS
The address which an alarm user designates on the application for a permit and the address to
which notices are to be sent.
PERSON
Any person, firm, partnership, corporation, association, company or organization of any kind.
PRIVATE ANSWERING POINT
A business which offers the service of receiving emergency signals, monitoring said signals and
relaying them to an emergency agency.
PROPRIETARY SYSTEM
An alarm sounding and/or recording within the premises protected by the alarm which is not
intended to alert persons outside the premises on which the alarm system is located of a possible
hazard and not intended to alert an emergency agency, the control center being under the
supervision of the proprietor of the protected premises. If the proprietary system includes a signal
line connected directly or by means of an automatic device to an emergency agency or to a
private answering point or to a local alarm system, it shall be deemed an "alarm system" as such
is defined in this chapter.
WATER FLOW ALARM
A sounding device activated by water flow detector or alarm check valve and arranged to sound
an alarm which will be audible in all living areas over background noise levels with all intervening
doors closed. This also includes Niagara Mohawk's alarm to warn fishermen of high water rising in
the Oswego River.
§ 57-3. Exemptions.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to proprietary alarm systems and residential smoke,
carbon monoxide heat or combustion detectors not connected to any point outside the premises or
intended to be heard or detected outside the premises. Permits shall be required for all alarm systems
located in buildings at federal, state or local government agencies or authorities or at public or private
schools; provided, however, that such alarm systems shall be exempt from the permit fees, but subject
to the fines and penalties herein provided for avoidable alarms and, where applicable, to the master
box fire alarm fee of the Fire Department. No alarm user permit required under this section shall be
revoked if such system is required by federal, state or local law. However, all other provisions of this
chapter shall apply to such systems, including the payment of authorized fees.
§ 57-4. Permit required.
No person shall own, lease, operate or maintain an alarm system within the City of Oswego, nor shall
any person cause an alarm system to be connected directly to the Oswego County 911 Center, unless
such person shall have first obtained from the city a permit for such alarm as herein provided.
§ 57-5. Permit application.
In order to obtain an alarm user permit, any person who operates an alarm system shall submit an
application for such permit to the Oswego City Police Department in the form designated by the

Any other information relating to the alarm system or user as the City of Oswego may from
time to time require.
The information required on the permit application shall be treated as confidential and shall not be
made available to members of the general public. The Oswego City Common Council finds that
the release of such information would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy and
could endanger the life or safety of persons and premises wherein an alarm system is located.
Accordingly, the information on a permit application shall be used by the City of Oswego for public
safety purposes only and shall be used for no other purpose whatsoever.
§ 57-6. Permit fees and issuance; transferability.
Except as provided in § 57-3 of this chapter, every application for an alarm user permit for alarm
systems in the City of Oswego shall be accompanied by the appropriate permit fee. No alarm user
permit shall be granted unless the fee is submitted at time of application. Fees shall be as follows:
For use of a local alarm, water flow alarm, central station and/or automatic dialing devices for
fire protection: $10.
For use of the municipal or auxiliary alarm system: $50.
For all other systems: $10.
Upon receipt of a properly executed permit application and permit fee, the Oswego City Police
Department shall issue an alarm user permit to the applicant.
The alarm user permit shall not be transferable and shall be kept on the premises where the alarm
system is located and made available for inspection by emergency agency personnel.
§ 57-7. Duration of permit.
An alarm user permit will be valid for a calendar year, and all permits shall expire on December 31.
§ 57-8. Renewal of permit.
Subject to the provisions of this chapter and upon the payment of the appropriate renewal fee as
provided in Subsection B hereof, an alarm user permit may be renewed by the alarm user.

The annual permit renewal fee shall be based upon the number of avoidable alarms recorded for
each alarm user as follows:
For all alarm users with zero to three avoidable alarms during the preceding permit year, no
renewal fee shall be charged.
For all alarm users with four avoidable alarms during the preceding year, a base permit
renewal fee of $50 shall be charged.
For all alarm users with more than four avoidable alarms during the preceding year, a base
permit fee of $50, plus an additional excessive-use fee for each avoidable alarm in excess of
four shall be charged as follows:
For the fifth, sixth and seventh avoidable alarms: $25 for each.
For the eighth, ninth and tenth avoidable alarms: $50 each.
For the eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth avoidable alarm: $75 each.
For every avoidable alarm after the thirteenth: $100 each.
At the time of the renewal, an alarm user shall receive credit for any amounts paid during the
permit year to reinstate a revoked permit.
No renewal of a permit shall be granted unless the appropriate renewal fee is submitted with
the application.
§ 57-9. Notice of excessive-use fees.
The Oswego Police Department shall notify an alarm user, in writing, by means of first-class mail sent
to the notice address listed on the permit application, when an alarm user has had three avoidable
alarms during the permit year. The notice shall inform the alarm user that additional avoidable alarms
will subject the alarm user to the excessive-use fee as specified in this chapter for each additional
avoidable alarm. At the end of the permit year, the Oswego City Police Department shall notify each
alarm user having more than three avoidable alarms incurred during the preceding year and the
amount to be charged for the renewal of the alarm user permit. Notice shall be in writing and shall be
sent by first-class mail to the notice address listed on the application.
§ 57-10. Revocation of permit.
An alarm user permit shall be revoked whenever 10 or more avoidable alarms are recorded for a
system in any one permit calendar year. Notice of such revocation shall be sent by the Oswego
City Police Department via first-class mail to the notice address listed on the permit application at
least 15 days prior to the effective date of permit revocation. An alarm user may reinstate a
revoked permit by the payment of the excessive-use fee for each avoidable alarm in excess of
three and by submission of proof that modifications have been made to the alarm system or other
steps have been effected so as to reduce the number of avoidable alarms, or why any such alarm
should not be classified as an avoidable alarm. An alarm system will not be revoked under this
section if said alarm system is required by federal, state or local law; provided, however, that all
other provisions of this chapter shall apply to such systems, and the user thereof shall remain
responsible for the payment of all authorized fees.
If no proof of modification or steps taken to reduce the number of avoidable alarms is submitted by
the alarm user within at least 15 days or if it is determined by the Chief of Police and/or designee
that the action taken or to be taken will not prevent the occurrence of false alarms, the Police

Chief and/or designee shall give notice by certified mail to the alarm user that the permit will be
revoked without further notice on the 15th day after receiving said certified letter.
An alarm user whose alarm permit has been revoked may have his/her permit reinstated by
submission of proof that modifications have been made to the alarm system to reduce the number
of avoidable alarms and by payment of all excessive use fees. Should another avoidable alarm
occur during the life of the permit in said calendar year, same shall be subject to summary
revocation. In such case, the revocation shall be effective on the 7th day following the mailing, by
certified mail, of a revocation by the Chief of Police. The alarm permit may then be reinstated,
after making a payment of a $50 fine and the appropriate excessive-use fee and submission of
proof that modifications have been made to the alarm system to reduce the number of avoidable
alarms. Should another avoidable alarm occur again during the life of the permit, the same above
procedures shall be followed.
§ 57-11. Avoidable alarm incident report.

shall file with the Oswego City Police Department an avoidable alarm report, which shall contain the
following information:
The alarm user's name and address.

The reasons why the alarm was determined to be an avoidable alarm.
Any other pertinent information.
§ 57-12. Silencing of local alarms.
All local alarm systems as defined in § 57-2 of this chapter shall become deactivated and silenced
automatically after a period of time not to exceed 15 minutes of activation.
Any person utilizing the local alarm system within the City of Oswego by virtue of such utilization
of a local alarm shall be deemed to have given consent to the police and/or fire officials of the City
of Oswego to disable an audible alarm signal that has not been silenced prior to expiration of the
fifteen-minute period referred to in Subsection A of this section, and neither the City of Oswego
nor its officers and employees, including but not limited to such police and fire officials, shall be
liable for any damages which may result from the disabling of an audible alarm signal as herein
provided.
§ 57-13. Penalties for operation without permit.
In addition to any other fees or penalties provided for in this chapter, a violation of § 57-4 of this
chapter shall be deemed an offense and shall be punishable by a mandatory fine of not less than $100
nor more than $250; provided, however, that no person shall be charged with such offense until the
expiration of 15 days after the date of written notice is mailed to such person by certified mail that
he/she is required to obtain an alarm user permit, and further provided that no charge shall be filled
against a person so notified if he/she obtains a permit during said fifteen-day period. A person found
guilty of violating § 57-4 of this chapter shall not be excused from obtaining a required permit.
§ 57-14. Written instructions required.

§ 63-6.1. Vicious and dangerous dogs.
[Added 11-10-2014 by L.L. No. 3-2014]
Declaration as dangerous; exceptions.
A dog may be declared dangerous if:
It chases, attacks, or approaches a person on any public or private property without
provocation in a menacing fashion or intent to attack.
It has a known history of attacking, causing injury, or otherwise endangering or
threatening the safety of human beings or domestic animals.
It assaults, inflicts injury upon, bites or otherwise attacks any human being, domestic
animal or household pet on public or private property.
It is trained for dog fighting or is harbored primarily or in part for the purpose of dog
fighting.
It acts in an aggressive manner, creating a public safety threat as witnessed by the
Animal Control Officer or Peace Officer on duty within the City of Oswego.
It menaces, attacks, or attempts to attack the Animal Control Officer or any peace officer
on duty while performing the duties of his/her job.
Exceptions.
No dog may be declared dangerous if the damage/injury occurred to a person committing
a willful trespass upon premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog, or if the dog
was being teased, tormented, abused, or assaulted, or if said person was in the process
of committing or attempting to commit a crime. If the trespass is deemed to be of an
innocent nature, the court may, depending on the circumstances, still find the dog to be
dangerous.
No dog may be declared dangerous if used by law enforcement officials for law
enforcement work.
Seizure of potentially dangerous dogs. An Animal Control Officer who has probable cause to
believe that a dog is vicious, as defined by this article, shall immediately take possession of the
dog and shall impound said dog and notify the owner of said impoundment, if notification does not
take place at the time of seizure. The owner of such dog may request the City Court to conduct a
hearing within five days of the notification of said impoundment to determine if the dog shall be
deemed dangerous. If no such hearing is requested within five days of the notification of the dog's
impoundment, the dog shall become the property of the City of Oswego. If the dog is licensed
within the City of Oswego at the time of seizure, the owner shall be given nine days to request
such hearing before the dog becomes the property of the City of Oswego, as required by New
York State Law. If no owner can be located, the dog will be held for five days as required by New
York State Law and then will become the property of the City of Oswego.

leash at any time the dog is outside its enclosure or house.
The owner shall obtain a metal basket muzzle for the dog. The basket muzzle must be
approved by the Animal Control Officer and must be worn by the dog at any time the dog is
outside its fenced enclosure or house, including while being moved to and from the fenced
enclosure and the house.
The dog shall not be left in the care or under the control of anyone under the age of 18 or
anyone who is physically unable to restrain the dog.
The dog shall be implanted with a microchip at the owner's expense. Said microchip must be
registered in the owner's name, and the registration must be kept current for the life of the
dog.
The dog shall be licensed in the City of Oswego, and such license must be renewed prior to
the expiration for the life of the dog unless the dog is relocated outside the City of Oswego or
the dog is surrendered to the City of Oswego.
The dog shall be spayed or neutered at the owner's expense.
The dog shall not be returned to any owner under the age of 18.
The dog shall remain in the custody of the owner named at the time of the dangerous
declaration and shall not be re-homed to any other party for any reason. In the event that the
owner can no longer care for said dog, the owner shall either have the dog euthanized by a
licensed veterinarian at the owner's expense or relinquish the dog to the City of Oswego
Animal Shelter along with a surrender fee of $100, as well as any impoundment fees or fees
due to the court at the time of relinquishment.

§ 85-1. Legislative findings; purpose.
It is the finding of the Common Council that buildings which remain vacant, with access points boarded

troublesome in residential and neighborhood-commercial neighborhoods. Unfortunately, many
buildings, once boarded, remain that way for many years. The purpose of this chapter is to establish a
program for identifying and registering vacant buildings; to determine the responsibilities of owners of
vacant buildings and structures; and to facilitate the rehabilitation of the vacant properties.

The term "secured," for the purposes of this section, shall mean that all means of ingress and

authorized persons.
All boarding material shall be finished on exterior with one coat of primer and exterior grade
paint to match that of the adjacent walls.

Enforcement Officer shall conduct an interior inspection without the consent of the building owner,
unless the Code Enforcement Officer has first obtained a warrant from a court of competent
jurisdiction.
The owner of a building which remains vacant for a period of 365 days or more shall be subject to
the requirements of this section. By the end of such time period, the owner of the vacant building
shall demonstrate to the Code Enforcement Division that said owner has taken all positive action
to abate the vacancy of the building in an expeditious manner. This action may include but is not
limited to:
Applying for and obtaining a permit to repair and rehabilitate the building, or to demolish it,
and proceeding with the work in a timely fashion;
Providing competent evidence that the building is listed for sale at fair market value by the
owner or a licensed realtor and is being periodically advertised for sale in a local newspaper,
through the multiple listing service, or otherwise marketed by the owner; or
Providing a proposed schedule of action to undertake repair and rehabilitation of the building,
including a detailed financial plan for its accomplishment.
§ 85-6. Damaged, unsafe and dangerous buildings.
The Code Enforcement Division shall examine or cause to be examined every building reported as
unsafe, damaged or vacant and shall make a written record of each examination.
Whenever a Code Enforcement Officer shall find a building or structure or a portion thereof to be
damaged, unsafe or dangerous, he/she shall give the owner, agent or person in control of such
building or structure written notice pursuant to § 83-4D of this Code, stating the defects thereof.
This notice shall require the owner within a stated time either to complete specified repairs or
improvements or to demolish and remove the building or structure or portion thereof.
If a Code Enforcement Officer finds that the building or structure is a dangerous building as
defined in Chapter 83 of the Code of the City of Oswego, such notice shall require the building,
structure or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the specified repairs
and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by a Code Enforcement Officer. The
Code Enforcement Officer shall cause to be posted at each entrance of such building a notice
which includes the statement: "This building has been found to be a dangerous building and its
use or occupancy has been prohibited by the Code Enforcement Division of the City of Oswego."
Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs or demolition is completed. It shall be
unlawful for any person, firm or corporation, or their agents or other servants, to remove such
notice without written permission of the Code Enforcement Officer, or for any person to enter the
building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the same.
In the event that an owner fails, neglects or refuses to comply with a notice to repair or remove a
dangerous building or structure within the time limits specified in the notice provided herein, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall cause the affected building or structure to be repaired or removed
pursuant to the provisions of §§ 83-4 and 83-5 in Chapter 83[1] of the Code of the City of Oswego.

quarterly basis and notify the owner or agent of any accumulation of trash, debris, rodent
infestation, the failure to keep said building secured or other violation of law, ordinance, City or

The owner shall have seven days from receipt of said notice to correct such conditions,
unless the Code Enforcement Officer is of the opinion that a vacant building or any structure
is, for any cause, dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of the public or is unfit for
occupancy, in which case the provisions of Chapter 83 shall apply.
If the Code Enforcement Officer finds that a vacant building or structure is damaged or so
poorly maintained that it is in violation of any applicable state or local property maintenance
laws or regulations, and the owner fails, neglects or refuses, after having been given proper
notice, to correct such violation or to properly secure or board up the building as required
herein, the Code Enforcement Division shall report such fact to the Common Council in
writing.
The Common Council by resolution may authorize the Code Enforcement Division to cause
such building or structure to be repaired, secured, or boarded up, and the cost of the same
shall be charged against the land upon which such building exists in the same manner as
local assessments provided for in the Charter of the City of Oswego.
For this purpose, a Code Enforcement Officer may enter upon such building or structure with
such assistance as may be necessary.
§ 85-7. Fees.
The owner of a vacant building shall pay an annual fee as set forth in Subsection A, as amended from
time to time by resolution of the Common Council, for the time that the building remains a vacant
building.
The first-year annual fee shall be $250 and shall be paid no later than 30 days after the building
becomes vacant. If the fee is not paid within 30 days of becoming due, the owner shall be subject
to a fine as prescribed in Chapter 249[1] of the Code of the City of Oswego. If a plan is extended
beyond 365 days, subsequent annual fees shall be paid as follows:

longer deemed vacant under the provisions of this chapter within 180 days of its registry.

assuring compliance with the provisions of this chapter. Upon the request of a Code Enforcement
Officer, an owner may provide access to all interior portions of an unoccupied building in order to
permit a complete inspection. Nothing contained herein, however, shall diminish the owner's right to
insist upon the procurement of a search warrant from a court of competent jurisdiction by a Code
Enforcement Officer or his or her designee in order to enable such inspection, and a Code
Enforcement Officer shall be required to obtain a search warrant whenever an owner refuses to permit
a warrantless inspection of the premises.
§ 85-10. Annual reports.
The Code Enforcement Division shall submit an annual report to the Mayor and Common Council,
listing all buildings in the City declared vacant under the provisions of the chapter, the date upon which
they were declared vacant and whether a vacant building registration and vacant building plan has

Any person violating any provision of the vacant building registry or providing false information to a
Code Enforcement Officer shall be punished as provided by Chapter 249 of the Code of the City of
Oswego.
Article II. Blight Reduction Program
§ 85-12. Legislative findings; purpose.
It is the finding of the Common Council that the rehabilitation of the vacant properties that are the
subject of this chapter is critical to revitalizing neighborhoods where vacant buildings have been left
unattended. The State of New York has also made the eradication of so-called "zombie" properties a
priority and has authorized municipalities to implement local laws, rules and regulations to address this
growing problem. With the assistance of the New York State Attorney General's Office, funds are
available to assist the City of Oswego with the rehabilitation of such properties in the manner
determined within this chapter.

officer charged with the enforcement of this chapter and is hereinafter referred to as the
"enforcement officer." The enforcement officer is hereby authorized to issue appearance tickets,
pursuant to the Criminal Procedure Law of the State of New York, to secure the enforcement of
this article.
Notice of violation and order to remedy. The enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue a
notice of violation and order to remedy directing the person, owner, lessee, property manager,
tenant, occupant or other person having control, directly or indirectly, of any property, including but
not limited to foreclosed property, vacant property, abandoned property and property wherein a
foreclosure has been filed but not completed, to bring such property into compliance with the
provisions of this chapter. Such notice of violation and order to remedy shall be in writing, shall
reference the applicable section of the City of Oswego Code, and shall include a concise
statement of the reasons for its issuance. The notice of violation and order to remedy shall state
that the violation must be remedied within 10 days of the date of service of such notice, exclusive
of the date of service. The enforcement officer may extend the period for compliance if, in his or
her judgment, the violation cannot reasonably be remedied within 10 days. The enforcement

officer shall modify the notice and order to state such reasonably required extended period, which
shall then be applicable instead of the aforesaid 10 days.
Appearance ticket. If the violation is not remedied within the time set forth in the notice of violation
and order to remedy, the enforcement officer shall issue an appearance ticket requiring the
person, owner, lessee, property manager, tenant, occupant or other person having charge of any
property to appear in City Court for a determination by the City Court of claimed violations and to
impose penalties as set forth herein.
Service of notice. Service of a notice of violation and order to remedy or appearance ticket shall
be served personally on the owner or owners of the property. Service on the person, owner,
lessee, property manager, tenant, occupant or other person having charge of any property shall be
considered service on the owner. Where personal service cannot be made with due diligence,
service shall be by certified mail, return receipt requested, and by posting said notice in a
conspicuous place on the property. Where, after due diligence, the enforcement officer is unable
to confirm the owner of the property and, thus, cannot personally serve the owner of the property,
posting said notice, order and appearance ticket in a conspicuous place on the property for a
period of not less than 10 days shall constitute adequate notice.
Appeal before the Common Council. The notice of violation and order to remedy may be appealed
in writing to the Common Council. Such appeal shall be delivered to the City Clerk within the
required ten-day period, or other such period as directed by the enforcement officer. Any notice so
appealed shall be tolled until such time as the City Clerk specifies in writing to the appellant a date
and time of a hearing to be held before the Common Council.
Hearing. The owner or his or her attorney or other representative shall be afforded the opportunity,
upon written appeal within the period set forth on the order to remedy, to appear before the
Common Council to contest the enforcement officer's order to remedy before any further action is
taken by the City. The Common Council may consider the violations cited in the notice of violation
and may adopt a resolution affirming, modifying or withdrawing the enforcement officer's violation
and order to remedy.
In addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies, upon failure of a person or entity to comply
with a notice to correct, remove or prevent a condition which violates a provision of this chapter,
the Common Council may, upon due notice and due opportunity for a hearing, order the condition
abated and authorize the enforcement officer to take all necessary steps to carry out the Common
Council's order, including, through its officers, employees, contractors or agents, to enter upon the
property and correct and remedy the violation. All costs incurred by the City, including the cost of
correction and remedy and the cost of the proceeding, including but not limited to reasonable
attorney, engineering and consulting fees, shall be charged to the owner of such real property and,
if not paid in full within 30 days after billing the owner, shall be assessed and levied against the
property and shall constitute a lien against the property and may be collected in the same manner
as other City real property taxes.
In addition to establishing a lien, the City may recover such costs and expenses by bringing an
action against the owner(s) of the property. The institution of such action shall not suspend or bar
the right to pursue any other remedy provided by law for the recovery of such costs and expenses.
Other remedies available. Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to restrict the
authority to provide for the abatement of a public nuisance conferred upon any agency of the City
by any other provision of law.
§ 85-17. Accelerated abatement action.
Whenever the enforcement officer finds that a condition in violation of this chapter exists, and that
such condition poses a threat to the public health or safety which requires immediate attention, or

in the case of a vacant building, or whenever a "zombie" owner has been identified that is the
subject of a "zombie" foreclosure, he or she may issue an order by service of notice in the manner
set forth above, reciting the existence of the dangerous condition and requiring that such action be
taken by the owner immediately or as soon thereafter as specified by the enforcement officer to
remedy the dangerous condition, secure the vacant building, or maintain the "zombie" property.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, such order shall be effective immediately. Any
person to whom such an order is directed shall comply therewith immediately. Upon objection in
writing to the City Clerk within five days of its issuance, any such person shall be afforded a
hearing before the Common Council as soon as is reasonably possible. After such a hearing and
decision by the Common Council as to the existence or nonexistence of the dangerous condition,
vacancy, or "zombie" property, the Common Council may continue such order in effect or modify
or withdraw it.
Dangerous conditions. The term "dangerous conditions" shall include but not be limited to:
Any and all structures, trees, shrubs, long grasses or other growth that obstructs a public
road, street or sidewalk, or obstructs a clear sight-line along a public street, road or sidewalk.
Rodent infestation of property or premises.
Dead, damaged or fallen trees, tree branches, shrubs or structures that overhang or
otherwise obstruct passage along public streets, roads or sidewalks.
Cost to remedy by City. If, after notice, the owner of property fails to comply with an order to
remedy a dangerous condition, vacant building, or "zombie" property, the Common Council may,
by resolution, cause City funds to be expended to remedy the condition of the building. Such cost
shall be charged to the property owner and, if unpaid, shall become a lien upon the property,
subject to collection as a tax thereon, after due notice to the owner and the opportunity of a
hearing before the Common Council as to the justness of the costs. Said City funds shall be
designated as the Blight Reduction Revolving Fund, into which funds allocated to the City of
Oswego by the State of New York will be drawn from time to time to remedy the condition of the
building in violation of this chapter and upon collection as a tax shall be returned to the said
revolving fund to be reutilized to remedy other property in violation of this chapter.
§ 85-18. Penalties for offenses.
In addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies, any person, owner, occupant, property
manager or any other person who violates any provision of this chapter or who violates or fails to
comply with any lawful order promulgated hereunder shall be guilty of a violation and, for a first
conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine in an amount not less than $300 nor more than $500
per day of violation or a maximum of 15 days' imprisonment, or both; for conviction of a second
violation committed within 12 months of the first violation, such person shall be subject to a fine in
an amount not less than $400 and not more than $800 per day of violation or a maximum of 15
days' imprisonment, or both; for conviction of a third violation committed within 12 months of the
first violation, such person shall be subject to a fine in an amount not less than $600 and not more
than $1,500 per day of violation or a maximum of 15 days' imprisonment, or both; for conviction of
a fourth violation and for each subsequent violation committed within 12 months of any prior
violation, such person shall be subject to a fine in an amount not less than $1,000 and not more
than $2,500 per day of violation or a maximum of 15 days' imprisonment, or both.
Civil penalties and injunction. In addition to and not in lieu of any other remedies, the Common
Council may also maintain an action or proceeding in the name of the City in a court of competent
jurisdiction to obtain civil monetary penalties and compel compliance with or to restrain, by
injunction, the violation of this chapter or any order promulgated hereunder. The civil monetary
penalties shall be in accordance with and not exceed the monetary penalties set forth in
Subsection A of this section.

The City of Oswego hereby assumes the responsibility and authority to implement and administer a
coastal erosion management program within its jurisdiction pursuant to Article 34 of New York State
Environmental Conservation Law. In addition, it is the purpose of this chapter to:
Establish standards and procedures for minimizing and preventing damage to structures from
shoreline erosion and to protect natural protective feature areas.
Regulate, in coastal areas subject to serious erosion, land use and development activities so as to
minimize or prevent damage or destruction to man-made property, natural protective features,
other natural resources and to protect human life.
Regulate new construction or placement of structures in order to place them a safe distance from
areas of active erosion and to ensure that these structures are not prematurely destroyed or
damaged due to improper siting.
Restrict public investment in services, facilities or activities which are likely to encourage new
permanent development in erosion hazard areas.
Regulate the construction of erosion protection structures in coastal areas subject to serious
erosion to assure that when the construction of erosion protection structures is justified, their
construction and operation will minimize or prevent damage or destruction to man-made property,
private and public property, natural protective features and other natural resources.

The City of Oswego finds that the coastal erosion hazard area:
Is prone to erosion from action of Lake Ontario. Such erosion may be caused by the action of
waves, currents running along the shore and wind-driven water and ice. Such areas are also
prone to erosion caused by the wind, runoff of rain water along the surface of the land or
groundwater seepage, as well as by human activities, such as construction, navigation and certain
forms of recreation.
Experiences coastal erosion which causes extensive damage to publicly and privately owned
property and to natural resources, as well as endangering human lives. When this occurs,
individuals and private businesses suffer significant economic losses, as do the city and the state
economies, either directly through property damage or indirectly through loss of economic return.
Large public expenditures may also be necessitated for the removal of debris and damaged
structures and replacement of essential public facilities and services.
Experiences erosion-related problems that are often contributed to by man's building without
considering the potential for damage to property by undertaking activities which destroy natural
protective features, such as dunes or vegetation; by building structures intended for erosion
prevention which may exacerbate erosion conditions on adjacent or nearby property; and by water
action produced by wakes from boats.
Is the subject of programs which foster erosion protection structures, either with private or public
finds, which are costly, often only partially effective over time and may even be harmful to adjacent
or nearby properties. In some sections of the city, major erosion protection structures of great
length would be required to effectively reduce future damage due to erosion.
§ 95-6. Definitions.
The following terms used in this chapter have the meanings indicated, unless the context clearly
requires otherwise:
ADMINISTRATOR
The local official responsible for administering and enforcing this chapter. The powers and duties
of this position are more fully described in § 95-23.
[1]
BEACH
The zone of unconsolidated material that extends landward from the mean low-water line to the
place where there is a marked change in a material or physiographic form or to the line of
permanent vegetation or to the waterward toe of a dune, whichever is most waterward.
BLUFF
Any bank or cliff with a precipitous or rounded face adjoining a beach or a body of water. The
waterward limit of a "bluff" is the landward limit of its contiguous beach. Where no beach is
present, the waterward limit is mean low water. The landward limit is twenty-five (25) feet landward
of the receding edge.

https://ecode360.com/print/OS0092?guid=OS0092&children=true 126/568
areas subject to regulation under this law.
DEBRIS LINE
A linear accumulation of waterborne debris deposited on a beach by storm-induced high water or
by wave action.
DUNE
A ridge or hill of loose, windblown or artificially placed material, principally sand.
EROSION
The loss or displacement of land along the coastline due to the action of waves, currents, winddriven
water, waterborne ice or other impacts of storms. It also means the loss or displacement of
land due to the action of wind, runoff of surface waters or groundwaters or groundwater seepage.
EROSION HAZARD AREA
An area of the coastline which is a structural hazard area or a natural protective feature area.
EROSION PROTECTION STRUCTURE
A structure specifically designed to reduce or prevent erosion, such as a groin, jetty, seawall,
revetment, breakwater or artificial beach-nourishment project.
EXISTING STRUCTURE
A structure and appurtenances in existence or one where construction has commenced or one
where construction has not begun but for which a building permit has been issued prior to June
25, 1984, which is the effective date of this chapter.
MAJOR ADDITION
An addition to a structure resulting in a twenty-five-percent-or-greater increase in the ground area
coverage of the structure. The increase will be calculated as the ground area coverage to be
added, including any additions previously constructed under an erosion area permit, divided by the
ground area coverage of the existing structure (see definition of "existing structure").

foundation are examples of "movable structures."
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE
A nearshore area, beach, bluff, primary dune, secondary dune or marsh, and their vegetation.
NATURAL PROTECTIVE FEATURE AREA
A land and/or water area containing natural protective features, the alteration of which might
reduce or destroy the protection afforded other lands against erosion or inundation.

direction perpendicular to the shoreline to a point where mean low-water depth is fifteen (15) feet
or to a horizontal distance of one thousand (1,000) feet from the mean low-water line, whichever is
greater.
NORMAL MAINTENANCE
Periodic replacement or repair of same-kind structural elements or protective coatings which do
not change the size, design or function of the original structural. "Normal maintenance" of a
structure does not require an erosion area permit.

The most waterward major dune where there are two (2) or more parallel dune lines within a
coastal area. Where there is only one (1) dune present, it is the primary one. Occasionally one (1)
or more relatively small dune formations exist waterward of the "primary dune." These smaller
formations will be considered to be part of the "primary dune" for the purposes of this chapter. The
waterward limit of a "primary dune" is the landward limit of its fronting beach. The landward limit of
a "primary dune" is twenty-five (25) feet landward of its landward toe.
RECEDING EDGE
The most landward line of active erosion or, in cases where there is no discernible line of active
erosion, the most waterward line of permanent vegetation.
RECESSION RATE
The rate, expressed in feet per year, at which an eroding shoreline moves landward.

estimated full replacement cost of the total structure as determined with reference to a current cost
data publication in common usage, such as Building Construction Cost Data by Means.
SECONDARY DUNE
The major dune immediately landward of the primary dune. The waterward limit of a "secondary
dune" is the landward limit of its fronting primary dune. The landward limit of a "secondary dune" is
twenty-five (25) feet landward of its landward toe.
SIGNIFICANT FISH AND WILDLIFE HABITAT
Those habitats essential to survival of a large portion of a particular fish or wildlife population
which support rare or endangered species, that support fish or wildlife populations having
significant commercial or recreational value or that would be difficult or impossible to replace.
STRUCTURAL HAZARD AREA
Those shorelands, other than natural protective features, subject to erosion and located landward
of shorelines having an average annual recession rate of one (1) foot or more per year. The inland
boundary of a "structural hazard area" is calculated by starting at the landward limit of a bluff and
measuring along lines perpendicular to the shoreline a horizontal distance which is forty (40) times
the long-term average annual recession rate.
STRUCTURE
Any object constructed, installed or placed in, on or under land or water, including, but not limited
to, a building; permanent shed; garage; mobile home; public service distribution, transmission or
collection systems; tanks; docks; piers; wharves; groins; jetties; seawalls; bulkheads; breakwaters;

§ 95-9. Findings required prior to issuance of permit.
An erosion area permit will be issued only with a finding by the Administrator that the proposed
regulated activity:
Is reasonable and necessary, considering reasonable alternatives to the proposed activity and the
extent to which the proposed activity requires a shoreline location.
Is not likely to cause a measurable increase in erosion at the proposed site or at other locations.
Prevents, if possible, or minimizes adverse effects on natural protective features and their
functions and protective values, existing erosion protection structures or natural resources.
§ 95-10. Restrictions applicable to regulated activities.
The following restrictions apply to regulated activities within structural hazard areas:
An erosion area permit is required for the installation of public service distribution, transmission or
collection systems for gas, electricity, water or wastewater. Systems installed along the shoreline
must be located landward of the shoreline structures.
The construction of nonmovable structures or placement of major nonmovable additions to an
existing structure is prohibited.

No movable structure may be placed or constructed such that, according to accepted engineering
practice, its weight places excessive groundloading on a bluff.
Plans for landward relocation of movable structures must be included with each application for a
permit. Movable structures which have been located within a structural hazard area, pursuant to
an erosion area permit, must be removed before the edge of the structure closest to the line of
recession is within ten (10) feet of the receding edge. The last owner of record, as shown on the
latest assessment roll, is responsible for removing that structure and its foundation, unless a
removal agreement was attached to the original erosion area permit. With the attachment of a
removal agreement of the erosion area permit, the landowner or the signator is responsible for the
landward relocation of movable structures. Removal agreements may be made when the last
owner of record and the owner of the structure are different with the approval of the city at the time
the permit is issued.
Debris from structural damage which may occur as a result of sudden unanticipated bluff-edge
failure, dune migration or wave or ice action must be removed within sixty (60) days of the
damaging event.
Any grading, excavating or other soil disturbance conducted within a structural hazard area must
not direct surface water runoff over the receding edge.
§ 95-11. Nearshore areas.
Nearshore areas function as reservoirs of sand, gravel, and other unconsolidated material for
beaches. Sandbars, which are located in nearshore areas, control the orientation of incoming
waves and promote the development of icecap formations which help to protect shorelines during
winter storms. The roots of aquatic vegetation in nearshore areas bind fine grained silts, clays and
organic matter to form a fairly cohesive bottom that resists erosion.
The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in nearshore areas:
Excavating, mining or dredging which diminishes erosion protection afforded by a natural
protective feature in a nearshore area is prohibited, except construction or maintenance of
navigation channels, bypassing sand around natural and man-made obstructions and artificial
beach nourishment, all of which require an erosion area permit.
Clean sand or gravel of a compatible type and size is the only material which may be
deposited within nearshore areas. Any deposition will require an erosion area permit.
§ 95-12. Beach areas.
Beaches buffer shorelands from erosion by absorbing wave energy that otherwise would be
expended on the toes of bluffs or dunes. Beaches that are high and wide protect shorelands from
erosion more effectively than beaches that are low or narrow. Beaches also act as reservoirs of
sand or other unconsolidated material for longshore littoral transport and offshore sandbar and
shoal formation.
The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in beach areas:

Excavation or mining which diminishes the erosion protection afforded by beaches is
prohibited.
Clean sand or gravel of a compatible type and size is the only material which may be
deposited within beach areas. Any deposition will require an erosion area permit, which may
be issued only for expansion or stabilization of beaches.
Active bird nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed unless such disturbance is
pursuant to a specific wildlife management activity approved, in writing, by the Department of
Environmental Conservation.
§ 95-13. Dune areas.
Dunes prevent wave overtopping and store sand for coastal processes. High, vegetated dunes
provide a greater degree of protection than low, unvegetated ones. Dunes are of the greatest
protective value during conditions of storm-induced high water. Because dunes often protect some
of the most biologically productive areas, their value is especially great. The key to maintaining a
stable dune system is the establishment and maintenance of beach grass or other vegetation on
the dunes and assurance of a supply of nourishment sand to the dunes.
The following restrictions apply to regulated activities in dune areas:
In primary dune areas:
Excavating or mining of primary dunes is prohibited.
Clean sand of a compatible type and size is the only material which may be deposited.
All depositions must be vegetatively stabilized using species tolerant of the conditions at
the site and must be placed so as to increase the size of or restore a dune or dune area.
Active bird nesting and breeding areas must not be disturbed unless such disturbance is
pursuant to a specific wildlife management activity approved, in writing, by the
Department.
In secondary dune areas:
All depositions must be of clean sand of a compatible type and size, and all grading must
be performed so as to increase the size of or restore a dune or former dune area.
Excavation or mining must not diminish the erosion protection afforded by the natural
protective feature.
Permitted construction, reconstruction, restoration or modifications must be built on
adequately anchored pilings, such that at least three (3) feet of open space exists
between the floor joists and the surface of the secondary dune; and the permitted activity
must leave the space below the lowest horizontal structural members free of
obstructions.
All other activities and development in dune areas are prohibited, unless specifically provided
for by this chapter.
The restrictions of § 95-16, Traffic control, apply to dune areas.
§ 95-14. Bluff areas.

Bluffs protect shorelands and coastal development by absorbing the often destructive energy of
open water. Bluffs are a source of depositional material for beaches and other unconsolidated
natural protective features.
Prohibited activities; restrictions.
The following activities are prohibited on bluffs:
Excavating or mining, except when in conjunction with conditions stated in an erosion
area permit issued for minor alterations in construction of an erosion protection structure
or for provision of shoreline access.
All development, unless specifically allowed by this section.
Disturbance of active bird nesting and breeding areas, unless such disturbance is
pursuant to a specific wildlife management activity approved in writing by the
Department.
Soil disturbance that directs surface water runoff over the receding edge.
The restrictions of § 95-16, Traffic control, shall apply to bluffs.
Activities specifically allowed under this section are:
Minor alteration of a bluff done in accordance with conditions stated in an erosion area permit
issued for new construction, modification or restoration of an erosion protection structure.
Bluff cuts done in accordance with conditions stated in an erosion area permit issued for the
provision of shoreline access, provided that:
Cuts are made in a direction perpendicular to the shoreline.
Ramp slopes may not exceed one to six (1:6).
Side slopes may not exceed one to three (1:3) unless terraced or otherwise structurally
stabilized.
Side slopes and other disturbed nonroadway areas must be stabilized with vegetation or
other approved physical means.
Completed roadways must be stabilized and drainage provided for.
New construction, modification or restoration of walkways or stairways done in accordance
with conditions of an erosion area permit.
§ 95-15. Erosion protection structures.
The following requirements apply to the construction, modification or restoration of erosion protection
structures:
The construction, modification or restoration of erosion protection structures must:
Not be likely to cause a measurable increase in erosion at the development site or at other
locations.
Minimize and, if possible, prevent adverse effects upon natural protective features, existing
erosion protection structures and natural resources, such as significant fish and wildlife
habitats.

All erosion protection structures must be designed and constructed according to generally
accepted engineering principles which have demonstrated success or, where sufficient data is not
currently available, a likelihood of success in controlling long-term erosion. The protective
measures must have a reasonable probability of controlling erosion on the immediate site for at
least thirty (30) years.
All materials used in such structures must be durable and capable of withstanding inundation,
wave impacts, weathering and other effects of storm conditions for a minimum of thirty (30) years.
Individual component materials may have a working life of less than thirty (30) years only when a
maintenance program ensures that they will be regularly maintained and replaced as necessary to
attain the required thirty (30) years of erosion protection.
A long-term maintenance program must be included with every permit application for construction,
modification or restoration of an erosion protection structure. The maintenance program must
include specifications for normal maintenance of degradable materials. To assure compliance with
the proposed maintenance program, a bond may be required.
§ 95-16. Traffic control.
Motorized and nonmotorized traffic must comply with the following restrictions:
Motor vehicles must not travel on vegetation, must operate waterward of the debris line and, when
no debris line exists, must operate waterward of the waterward toe of the primary dune or bluff.
Motor vehicle traffic is prohibited on primary dunes, except for officially designated crossing areas
and on bluffs.
Pedestrian passage across primary dunes must utilize elevated walkways and stairways or other
specially designed dune crossing structures.
§ 95-17. Emergency activities.
Applicability. The requirements of this chapter do not apply to emergency activities that are
necessary to protect public health, safety or welfare, including preventing damage to natural
resources. Whenever emergency activities are undertaken, damage to natural protective features
and other natural resources must be prevented, if possible, or minimized.
Notification to Administrator. The Administrator must be notified by the person responsible for
taking the emergency measures within two (2) working days from the commencement of an
emergency measure, and a description of the problem and activities must be provided. The
description shall be in written form, outline the public health or safety or resource for which
protection was sought and relate the measures which were taken to secure the protection.
Improper or insufficient notification. If the Administrator determines that a regulated activity has
been undertaken without an erosion area permit and does not meet the emergency activity
criteria, then the Administrator shall order the immediate cessation of the activity. In addition, the
Administrator may require:
Removal of any structure that was constructed or placed without an erosion area permit.
The return to former conditions of any natural protective feature that was excavated, mined or
otherwise disturbed without an erosion area permit.

All responsible means and measures to mitigate adverse impacts on natural systems and
their functions and values have been incorporated into the activity's design, at the property
owner's expense.
The development will be reasonably safe from flood and erosion damage.
The variance requested is the minimum necessary to overcome the practical difficulty or
hardship which was the basis for the requested variance.
Where public funds are utilized, the public benefits must clearly outweigh the long-term
adverse effects.
Format and procedure. Any request for a variance must be in writing and specify the standard,
restriction or requirement to be varied and how the requested variance meets the criteria of
Subsection A of this section. The burden of demonstrating that the requested variance meets
those criteria rests entirely with the applicant.

Falsely stating the reasons for offering or supplying goods or services at sale or discount
prices.
Communicating with the debtor or any member of his family or household with such frequency
or at such unusual hours or in such a manner as can reasonably be expected to abuse or
harass the debtor.
Any deception, fraud, false pretense, false premise, misrepresentation or the knowing
concealment, suppression or omission of any material fact with the intent that consumers rely

whether or not any person has, in fact, been misled, deceived or damaged thereby.
Use of the word "free," except as herein provided:
When making free or similar offers, all substantial terms, conditions and obligations upon
which the right to take advantage of such offer is directly depended shall appear in close
conjunction with the offer of free merchandise or service and in a manner which is as
prominent as the offer of free merchandise or services. For the purpose of this regulation,
placement of the terms of an offer set forth in a footnote of an advertisement to which
reference is made by an asterisk or other symbol placed next to the offer is not in close
conjunction.
If a consumer good or service is to be given free upon the purchase of some additional
merchandise or service, said additional service or merchandise must not be sold at
above the regular price, nor may the quantity or quality of the product be diminished.
A free offer of a single size of a product or a single kind of a service shall not be
advertised by the same person in a trade area for more than six (6) months in any
twelve-month period. At least thirty (30) days shall elapse before another such offer is
promoted in the same trade area. No more than three (3) such offers shall be made in
the same area in a twelve-month period.
No free offer shall be made in connection with the introduction of a new product or
service offered for sale at a specified price unless the offeror expects, in good faith, to
commence selling the product or service promoted, separately, at the same price at
which it was promoted with a free offer.
The use of any term in an advertisement which tends to indicate that the goods or service
is free shall fall within the purview of this chapter.
For the purposes of this regulation, the following definitions shall apply:
FREE
A consumer shall pay nothing for an article so offered and not more than the regular
price for any other article which must be purchased by the consumer in order to avail
himself of said "free" offer.
REGULAR PRICE
The price in the same quantity, quality and with the same service, at which the seller
or advertiser of said product or service has openly and actively sold the product or
service in the trade area in which he is making a free or similar offer for a prior
period of thirty (30) days. For consumer products or services which fluctuate in price,
the "regular price" shall be the lowest price at which any substantial sales were
made during the aforesaid thirty-day period.
Use of the words "special," "bargain," "savings" or similar language, except as herein
provided:
When the words "special," "bargain," "savings" or similar language represent a reduction
in price in comparison to one's own price at a past or specified future time; and

In any action brought under the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations
promulgated thereunder, the Office of Consumer Affairs, or any other department designated
by the Mayor, is entitled to recover from the violator the office's or department's cost for
investigation and hearing, provided that a repeated, multiple or persistent violation has been
established by the Consumer Complaint Investigator, or any city officer or employee
designated by the Mayor, of said office or department.
Remedies.
Whenever any person has engaged in any practices which constitute violations of any
provisions of this chapter or any rule or regulation promulgated thereto, the Office of
Consumer Affairs, or any other department designated by the Mayor, may make application to
the Supreme Court for an order enjoining such acts or practices and for an order granting a
temporary or permanent injunction, restraining order or other order enjoining such acts or
practices.
Whenever any person has engaged in an unconscionable or deceptive trade practice to the
detriment of a consumer, such consumer may seek redress in a court of appropriate
jurisdiction, except that no consumer shall have the authority to sue for a civil penalty or to
commence a criminal action as provided by the Consumer Code.
Settlements.
In lieu of instituting or continuing an action pursuant to this Consumer Code or any rule or
regulation promulgated thereto, the Consumer Complaint Investigator, or any city officer or
employee designated by the Mayor, may accept a written assurance of discontinuance of any
act or practice in violation of this chapter from the person or persons who have engaged in
such acts or practices. Such settlement agreement may include, but is not limited to, a
stipulation for voluntary payment by the violator or the costs or investigation by the Consumer
Complaint Investigator or any city officer or employee designated by the Mayor and may
include a stipulation for the restitution by the consumer of money, property or other things
received from them in connection with a violation of this chapter, including money necessarily
expended in the course of making and pursuing a complaint to the Consumer Complaint
Investigator or any city officer or employee designated by the Mayor. If such stipulation
applies to consumers who have been affected by the violator's practice but have not yet
complained to the Consumer Complaint Investigator or any city officer or employee
designated by the Mayor, the settlement agreement must be approved by court, which shall
direct the minimum means by which potential claimants shall be notified of the agreement. A
consumer need not accept restitution pursuant to such a settlement agreement; his
acceptance shall bar recovery of any other damages in any action by him against the
defendant or defendants on account of the same acts or practices.
All settlement agreements shall be made a matter of public record.
Violation of a settlement agreement entered into pursuant to this section shall be treated as a
violation of this chapter and shall be subject to all the penalties provided therefor.

Investigator, or any city officer or employee designated by the Mayor, of the Office of Consumer Affairs,

competent jurisdiction in the manner prescribed by law.

Chapter 115. Environmental Protection Code
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Common Council of the City of Oswego 10-28-2019 by L.L. No. 8-2019.[1]
Amendments noted where applicable.]
Editor's Note: The subtitle for this chapter is "'Keep Oswego Clean' Initiative."
Article I. Authority; Intent
§ 115-1. Statutory authority.
Pursuant to Municipal Home Rule Law § 10, Subdivision 1(ii)a(12), the Environmental Protection Code
of the City of Oswego is enacted.
§ 115-2. Legislative intent.
It is the intent of the Common Council of the City of Oswego, as an exercise of its police power, to
promote the general health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City by enacting this chapter.
The City of Oswego is the first freshwater port of the Great Lakes of the United States of America for
vessels traveling from the Atlantic Ocean and through the St. Lawrence Seaway. Derived from the
Iroquois language meaning "the pouring out place, a river's mouth," Oswego has long strived to be a
steward of the environment. The enactment of the articles contained in this chapter are intended to
support and strengthen that stewardship for the benefit of the many generations to follow so they can
appreciate and perpetuate the beauty and resources of Oswego.
Article II. Disposable Expanded Polystyrene Containers
Editor's Note: This article, formerly Article I, was redesignated for organizational purposes.
§ 115-3. Purpose.
The Common Council for the City of Oswego finds that disposable expanded polystyrene, commonly
referred to as Styrofoam, is difficult to recycle, does not decompose and makes up a significant portion

Article IV. Smoking - City Facilities
Editor's Note: This article, formerly Article III, Part 1, was redesignated for organizational purposes.
§ 115-10. Legislative intent.
The City of Oswego Common Council finds that scientific studies have proven that cigarette
smoking, cigar smoking or the smoking of other tobacco products causes chronic lung disease,
coronary heart disease, stroke and cancer of the lungs, larynx, esophagus, mouth, bladder and
contributes to cancer of the cervix, pancreas and kidneys. More than 440,000 people die in the
United States from tobacco-related diseases every year, making it the nation's leading cause of
preventable illness. Furthermore, a number of studies have indicated that exposure to outdoor
tobacco smoke is similar to the levels of exposure to indoor levels of secondhand smoke. The
United States Environmental Protection Agency has found secondhand smoke to be a risk to
public health and has classified secondhand smoke as a Group A carcinogen. Exposure to
secondhand smoke is the third leading cause of preventable death in this country. In addition to
the health impact, outdoor smoking results in significant amount of litter from cigarettes, cigarette
filters, tobacco packaging and wrappers, which can be costly to both the environment and
municipalities.
The City of Oswego Common Council further finds that smoking in outdoor public areas makes it
difficult to pass through because of individuals smoking and the clouds of smoke that fill the air. It
has become unsightly as cigarette butts, filters, and tobacco packaging are thrown on the ground,
causing a litter problem in public areas.
§ 115-11. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
SMOKING
The act of engaging in the smoking of tobacco, generally by cigarette, cigar, or pipe. For the
purpose of this article, vaping shall be synonymous with "smoking."
VAPING
To inhale and exhale vapor of any substance from an e-cigarette or a similar electronic device.
§ 115-12. Restrictions.
Smoking is prohibited throughout the City facilities and in any City offices.
§ 115-13. Enclosed work areas; rights of nonsmoker.

B.

Smoking is prohibited in any indoor enclosed work area. The rights of a nonsmoker to a smoke-free
work area shall prevail.
§ 115-14. Common areas.
Smoking is prohibited in all employee restrooms, elevators, hallways and areas containing office
equipment used in common.
Smoking is prohibited in conference or meeting rooms and municipal vehicles.
§ 115-15. Conflicts and complaints.
Conflicts should be brought to the attention of the appropriate supervisory personnel. Employees may
also file a formal complaint with the Oswego County Health Department, which has the sole jurisdiction
to enforce the new law on a county-wide basis.
§ 115-16. Rules to be posted and distributed.
Copies of these rules will be posted and distributed to all departments, employees and to all
prospective employees upon request.
§ 115-17. Amendments.
This policy may be amended from time to time by resolution of the City of Oswego. All amendments
shall be in conformance with New York State law, and employees will be notified accordingly.
Article V. Smoking - Outdoors
Editor's Note: This article, formerly Article III, Part 2, was redesignated for organizational purposes.
§ 115-18. Outdoor smoking prohibited.
Smoking or vaping cigarettes, cigars, pipes or any form of tobacco products or other substances in, on,
or within 30 feet of any City-owned parks, beaches, pools, recreation centers, playgrounds, outdoor
sporting arenas, outdoor stages, parking garages or the sidewalks immediately adjoining the parks,
outdoor recreation areas, parking garages and public places is strictly prohibited.
§ 115-19. Penalties for offenses.
Any person who violates any provision of this chapter shall, upon conviction for a first offense, be
punished by a fine of not less than $100, nor more than $150; and upon a second offense the sum of
not less than $150, nor more than $200; and upon a third and subsequent offense the sum of $250 or

§ 133-1. Findings.
The Common Council of the City of Oswego finds that the potential and/or actual damages from
flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of the City of Oswego and that such damages
may include destruction or loss of private and public housing, damage to public facilities, both publicly
and privately owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat of such
damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 133-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion
hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected
against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which
are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood
damages.
Regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may
increase flood hazards to other lands.
Qualify for and maintain participation in the National Flood Insurance Program.
§ 133-3. Objectives.
The objectives of this chapter are to:
Protect human life and health.
Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken
at the expense of the general public.
Minimize prolonged business interruptions.
Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone,
sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard.
Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of
special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas.
Provide that developers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard.

actions.
§ 133-4. Definitions.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable
application.
APPEAL
A request for a review of the local administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter or
a request for a variance.
AREA OF MODERATE WAVE ACTION
The portion of the SFHA landward of a V Zone or landward of an open coast without mapped V
Zones, in which the principal sources of flooding are astronomical tides, storm surges, seiches, or
tsunamis, not riverine sources. Areas of moderate wave action may be subject to wave effects,
velocity flows, erosion, scour, or combinations of these forces and are treated as V Zones. The
area of moderate wave action is an area within a Zone AE that is bounded by a line labeled "Limit
of Moderate Wave Action."
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING
A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a
one-percent-or-greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and
where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD
The land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one-percent-or-greater chance of
flooding in any given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1 through A30,
A99, V, VO, VE, or V1 through V30. It is also commonly referred to as the "base floodplain" or
"one-hundred-year floodplain." For purposes of this chapter, the term "special flood hazard area
(SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD
The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT
That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL
A wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design
and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the
elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system.
BUILDING
See "structure."
CELLAR
Has the same meaning as "basement."
COASTAL HIGH-HAZARD AREA
An area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune
along an open coast and any other area subject to high-velocity wave action from storms or
seismic sources. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone V1 through V30, VE, VO or V. The
"coastal high-hazard area" shall also include areas on a FIRM within a Zone AE that is bounded
by a line labeled "Limit of Moderate Wave Action."

operations centers that are needed for flood response activities before, during, and after a
flood; and
Public and private utility facilities that are vital to maintaining or restoring normal services to
flooded areas before, during, and after a flood.
CUMULATIVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure that equals or
exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the improvement or repair when
counted cumulatively for 10 years.
DEVELOPMENT

Built, in the case of a building in Zones A1 through A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or
D, to have the top of the elevated floor, or in the case of a building in Zones V1 through
30, VE, or V, or area of moderate wave action to have the bottom of the lowest horizontal
structure member of the elevated floor, elevated above the ground level by means of
pilings, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and
Adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a
flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood.
In the case of Zones A1 through A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X, or D, "elevated building"
also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with
openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters.
In the case of Zones V1 through V30, VE, or V, "elevated building" also includes a building
otherwise meeting the definition of "elevated building," even though the lower area is
enclosed by means of breakaway walls that meet the federal standards.

The invalidity of any section or provision of this chapter shall not invalidate any other section or
provision thereof.
§ 133-9. Penalties for noncompliance.
No structure in an area of special flood hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended,
converted, or altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance with the terms of
this chapter and any other applicable regulations. Any infraction of the provisions of this chapter by
failure to comply with any of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute a violation. Any person who
violates this chapter or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be
fined no more than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days or both. Each day of noncompliance
shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the City of Oswego
from taking such other lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any structure
found not compliant with the requirements of this chapter for which the developer and/or owner has not
applied for and received an approved variance under § 133-23 will be declared noncompliant and
notification sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
§ 133-10. Warning and disclaimer of liability.
The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur
on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does
not imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be
free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of
Oswego, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any
flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.
§ 133-11. Designation of local administrator.
The Oswego City Engineer is hereby appointed local administrator to administer and implement this
chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 133-12. Purpose of floodplain development permit; fees.
Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all construction and other
development to be undertaken in areas of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose
of protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and ensuring that new development is
constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake
any development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 133-6, without a valid floodplain development permit. Application for a permit
shall be made on forms furnished by the local administrator and may include, but not be limited to:
plans, in duplicate, drawn to scale and showing: the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations
of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities,
and the location of the foregoing.
Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be accompanied by an application
fee of $100. In addition, the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of Oswego for
any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of this project. The local
administrator may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these additional costs.

used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice and with all applicable provisions of
this chapter.
§ 133-14. Duties and responsibilities of local administrator.
Duties of the local administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following:
Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the following permit application
review before issuing a floodplain development permit:
Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the requirements of § 133-13,
Application for permit, and for compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
Review subdivision and other proposed new development, including manufactured home
parks to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard, all new construction and
substantial improvements shall meet the applicable standards of §§ 133-15 through 133-22
and, in particular, § 133-15B, Subdivision proposals.
Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special flood hazard may result
in physical damage to any other property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The local administrator may require the applicant to submit additional technical
analyses and data necessary to complete the determination. If the proposed development
may result in physical damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§§ 133-15 through 133-22, no permit shall be issued. The applicant may revise the
application to include measures that mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit
the application.
Determine that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies
from which approval is required by state or federal chapter.
Use of other flood data.
When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated areas of special flood
hazard on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water
surface elevation data (These areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM.) nor identified

Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as two feet
above the depth number specified in feet on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 133-6 (at least two feet if no depth number is specified).
Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to guide floodwaters around
and away from proposed structures on slopes.
§ 133-18. Residential structures (coastal high-hazard areas).
The following standards, in addition to the standards in § 133-15A, Coastal high-hazard areas, and B,
Subdivision proposals, and § 133-16, Standards for all structures, apply to new and substantially
improved residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard shown as Zones V1 through
V30, VE or V, or in an area of moderate wave action, on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
designated in § 133-6.
Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated on pilings, columns
or shear walls such that the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member supporting the
lowest elevated floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles or columns,
grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to either withstand storm action or break
away without imparting damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the effects of wind and water
loads acting simultaneously during the base flood on all building components.
The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that would occur during the
base flood. Horizontal water loads considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves,
current drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris. Dynamic uplift loads
shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or other natural or man-made flow obstructions
could cause wave runup beyond the elevation of the base flood.
Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due to wind pressure. Wind
forces on the superstructure include windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on
the roof, internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and upward force on
the underside of the house when it is exposed. In the design, the wind should be assumed to
blow potentially from any lateral direction relative to the house.
Wind-loading values used shall be those required by the building code.
Foundation standards.
The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto shall be adequately anchored
to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures
acting simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be designed to transfer
safely to the underlying soil all loads due to wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads
(including uplift due to wind and water).
Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural support of a new building or
substantial improvement of an existing structure.
Pile foundation design.
The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less than 8:1 for individual piles.
(This shall not apply to pile clusters located below the design grade.) The maximum center-tocenter
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center under load bearing sills,
beams, or girders.

Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to resist the combined wave
and wind loads (lateral and uplift) associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with
typical structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration of decreased
resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata surrounding the piles. The minimum
penetration for foundation piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl)
datum if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if the BFE is greater
than +10 msl.
Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in column action from the
bottom of the structure to the stable soil elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or
diagonally braced to withstand wind and water forces.
The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of eight inches for round
timber piles and eight inches by eight inches for square timber piles. All wood piles must be
treated in accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and damage from
fungus.
Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twenty-eight-day ultimate
compressive strength of not less than 5,000 pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced
with a minimum of four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than 1% nor
more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for precast piles shall have a concrete
cover of not less than 1 1/4 inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches
for No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field shall have a concrete
cover of not less than two inches.
Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer, jetted, or augered into place.
Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include lateral or diagonal bracing
between piles.
When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both directions by a wood timber
grade beam or a reinforced concrete grade beam. These at-grade supports should be
securely attached to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eight-inch (minimum) members
bolted to the piles, shall be limited in location to below the lowest supporting structural
member and above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane along pile rows
perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cabletype
bracing is permitted in any plane.
Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the beam-to-pile connection,
may be used along pile rows perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-by-four-or-larger braces
framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts
(each end) for two-by-eight members, or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end) for square
members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three feet below the elevation of the base
flood.
Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete piers shall be internally
reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads, and be connected with a movement-resisting
connection to a pile cap or pile shaft.
Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood connectors, or bolts of size and
number adequate for the calculated loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a
structure. Toe nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal connectors
and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hot-dipped galvanized after fabrication.
Connectors in protected interior locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.

Beam-to-pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall span the supports in the
direction parallel to the flow of potential floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the
columns or pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall be connected
by reinforcement, if cast in place, or (if precast) shall be securely connected by bolting and
welding. If sills, beams, or girders are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two fiveeights-
inch galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16 inch by four inches by
18 inches each bolted with two one-half-inch lag bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching
of pile tops shall be the minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that the cross section is
reduced below 50%.
Floor and deck connections.
Wood two-inch-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist anchors shall be used to tie
floor joists to floor beams/girders. These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a
minimum. Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such cross bridging may be oneinch-
by-three-inch members, placed eight feet on-center maximum, or solid bridging of same
depth as joist at same spacing.
Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide good torsional resistance
in the horizontal plane of the structure. The plywood should not be less than three-fourthsinch
total thickness, and should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or joists with 8d
annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such fastening shall be supplemented by the
application of waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces.
Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required breaks under a wall stud or an
anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be used to secure rasters or joists and top and bottom plates to
studs in exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous fifteen-thirty-seconds-inchor-
thicker plywood sheathing-overlapping the top wall plate and continuing down to the sill, beam,
or girder-may be used to provide the continuous tie. If the sheets of plywood are not vertically
continuous, then two-by-four nailer blocking shall be provided at all horizontal joints. In lieu of the
plywood, galvanized steel rods of one-half-inch diameter or galvanized steel straps not less than
one-inch wide by one-sixteenth-inch thick may be used to connect from the top wall plate to the
sill, beam, or girder. Washers with a minimum diameter of three inches shall be used at each end
of the one-half-inch-round rods. These anchors shall be installed no more than two feet from each
corner rod, no more than four feet on center.
Ceiling joist/rafter connections.
All ceiling joists or rafters shall be installed in such a manner that the joists provide a
continuous tie across the rafters. Ceiling joists and rafters shall be securely fastened at their
intersections. A metal or wood connector shall be used at alternate ceiling joist/rafter
connections to the wall top plate.
Gable roofs shall be additionally stabilized by installing two-by-four-blocking on two-foot
centers between the rafters at each gable end. Blocking shall be installed a minimum of eight
feet toward the house interior from each gable end.
Projecting members. All cantilevers and other projecting members must be adequately supported
and braced to withstand wind and water uplift forces. Roof eave overhangs shall be limited to a
maximum of two feet and joist overhangs to a maximum of one foot. Larger overhangs and
porches will be permitted if designed or reviewed and certified by a registered professional
engineer or architect.
Roof sheathing.
Plywood, or other wood material, when used as roof sheathing, shall not be less than 15/32
inch in thickness, and shall be of exterior sheathing grade or equivalent. All attaching devices

for sheathing and roof coverings shall be galvanized or be of other suitable corrosion-resistant
material.
All corners, gable ends, and roof overhangs exceeding six inches shall be reinforced by the
application of waterproof industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces of any plywood
sheet used in the sheathing of such corner, gable end, or roof overhang.
In addition, roofs should be sloped as steeply as practicable to reduce uplift pressures, and
special care should be used in securing ridges, hips, valleys, eaves, vents, chimneys, and
other points of discontinuity in the roofing surface.
Protection of openings. All exterior glass panels, windows, and doors shall be designed, detailed,
and constructed to withstand loads due to the design wind speed of 75 mph. Connections for
these elements must be designed to transfer safely the design loads to the supporting structure.
Panel widths of multiple panel sliding glass doors shall not exceed three feet.
Breakaway wall design standards.
The breakaway wall shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than 10 and not
more than 20 pounds per square foot, with the criterion that the safety of the overall structure
at the point of wall failure be confirmed using established procedures. Grade beams shall be
installed in both directions for all piles considered to carry the breakaway wall load. Knee
braces are required for front row piles that support breakaway walls.
Use of breakaway wall strengths in excess of 20 pounds per square foot shall not be
permitted unless a registered professional engineer or architect has developed or reviewed
the structural design and specifications for the building foundation and breakaway wall
components, and certifies that the breakaway walls will fail under water loads less than those
that would occur during the base flood; and that the elevated portion of the building and
supporting foundation system will not be subject to collapse, displacement, or other structural
damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously on all building
components (structural and nonstructural). Water-loading values used shall be those
associated with the base flood. Wind-loading values shall be those required by the building
code.
§ 133-19. Nonresidential structures (except coastal high-hazard
areas).
The following standards apply to new and substantially improved commercial, industrial and other
nonresidential structures located in areas of special flood hazard, in addition to the requirements

evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter and:
The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect
of such damage on the individual owner;
The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;

The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency
vehicles;
The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with conducting search and
rescue operations during periods of flooding;
The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the
floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and
The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including
search and rescue operations, maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities
such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
Upon consideration of the factors of § 133-23A(4) and the purposes of this chapter, the
Zoning Board of Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions including technical
information and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency upon
request.
Conditions for variances.
Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be
erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood elevation, providing items in § 133-23A(4)(a)
through (l) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon
determination that:
The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an "historic structure"; and
The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of
the structure.
Variances may be issued by the Zoning Board of Appeals for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the conduct of a
functionally dependent use provided that:
The criteria of Subsection B(1), (4), (5) and (6) of this section are met; and
The structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages
during the base flood and create no additional threat to public safety.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels
during the base flood discharge would result.
Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum
necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
A showing of good and sufficient cause;
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to
the applicant; and

https://ecode360.com/print/OS0092?guid=OS0092&children=true 202/568
(c)
(7)
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights,
additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause
fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with other existing chapters or
ordinances.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the lowest floor below the
base flood elevation shall be given written notice over the signature of the Local Administor
that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.
§ 133-24. When effective.
This chapter shall take effect immediately upon filing with the Secretary of State.

in any court or courts having jurisdiction of such cause or action.

farm labor camps, travel trailers and trailer parks and other forms of temporary housing.
§ 149-5. Conflicts with other provisions.
The provisions of Part 1 shall supersede local laws, ordinances, codes or regulations to the extent
that such laws, ordinances, codes or regulations are inconsistent with the provisions of this Part 1;

higher standard than those provided in this Part 1, and such more restrictive requirement or higher
standard shall govern during the period in which it is in effect.
Where a provision of this Part 1 is found to be in conflict with a provision of a zoning, building,

life, safety, or the general welfare of the public, the Director of Code Enforcement shall be
authorized to issue said permit for the sole and exclusive purpose of bringing such violations
into compliance with the Code of the City of Oswego. Nothing contained herein shall relieve

The Common Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Oswego in the operation of
certain establishments and the use of property in flagrant violation of the penal laws of this state
and related statutes and ordinances, all of which substantially and seriously interfere with the
interests of the public in the quality of life and total community environment, commerce in the City,
residential living, property values and the public health, safety and welfare.
The Common Council further finds that while existing laws may be adequate to punish offensive
conduct and bring violators into compliance, said laws are not adequate to abate the nuisances
created by multiple offenders.
The Common Council further finds that the continued occurrence of such activities, violations and
attitudes is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of the City of Oswego and of the business
and residents thereof and the visitors thereto. It is the purpose of this chapter to authorize and
empower the Chief of Police to impose and enforce the sanctions of the court for such public
nuisances, and such powers may be exercised either in conjunction with, or apart from, the
powers contained in other laws without prejudice to the use of procedures and remedies available
under such other laws. The Council further finds that the sanctions and penalties imposed
pursuant to this chapter constitute an additional and appropriate method of law enforcement in
response to the proliferation of the hereafter-described public nuisances. The sanctions and
penalties are reasonable and necessary in order to protect the health and safety of the people of
the City and to promote the general welfare.
§ 170-2. Public nuisances enumerated.
[Amended 10-24-2006; 2-26-2007]
For the purposes of this chapter, a public nuisance exists where there exists a series of violations
of a designated nuisance offense, as that term is defined in § 170-3 of this chapter, which have
resulted in a conviction or series of verifiable violations of any of the following provisions resulting
from separate incidents occurring at or on the premises where 12 or more points are accumulated,
in accordance with the following point system. Where more than one violation occurs during a
single incident, the total points for the incident shall be the highest point value assigned to any
single violation. The violations shall be assigned the point value indicated in the definition of
"designated nuisance offense" in § 170-3. All accumulated points will be removed upon the sale of
the property to a bona fide purchaser for value who is not related to the property owner, or when
the City has obtained a remedy pursuant to § 170-5 of this chapter for the public nuisance at such
premises.
[Amended 8-10-2009]
The Chief of Police or his/her designee shall review all police incidents to determine if points
should be assessed to the property where such incident took place. The Chief of Police or his/her
designee shall have the authority to refrain from assessing points against the property in
circumstances where the offense is not related to the use of the property.
For the purpose of this chapter, a conviction for an offense(s) in a court of competent jurisdiction
or an administration bureau shall not be required. Instead, the City shall prove by a
preponderance of the evidence that the violations have occurred. However, a conviction as
defined and applied in accordance with the provisions of § 1.20 of the Criminal Procedure Law, in
any court of competent jurisdiction, shall constitute conclusive proof of a violation. Conviction of an
attempt to commit a violation of any of the specified provisions shall be considered a conviction for
a violation of the specified provision.
The provisions of this section shall not apply to any federal, state or local government building
and/or property, public or private schools, and health-care facilities, including hospitals and
nursing homes.

Any substance which will cause the POTW to violate its SPDES permit(s) or the receiving
water quality standards as a result of interference or pass-through.
Any wastewater with objectionable color not removed in the treatment process such as, but
not limited to, dye wastes and vegetable tanning solutions.
Any wastewater which contains heat in amounts which will accelerate the biodegradation of
wastes, causing the formation of excessive amounts of hydrogen sulfide in the POTW or
inhibit biological activity in the POTW treatment plant, but in no case shall the discharge of
heated wastewater exceed 150° F. (65° C.) or cause the temperature of the influent to the
POTW treatment plants to exceed 104° F. (40° C.). The City Engineer reserves the right in
certain instances to prohibit or limit the discharge of heated wastewater with maximum
temperatures less than 150° F. (65° C.).
Any pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, etc.), released at a flow rate
and/or pollutant concentration which will cause interference with the POTW. In no case shall a
slug load have a flow rate or contain concentrations or quantities of pollutants that exceed for
any time period longer than 15 minutes more than five times the average twenty-four-hour
concentration, quantities or flow during normal operations.
Any wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or isotopes except in compliance with
applicable state or federal regulations.
Any wastewater containing fats, waxes, grease or oils which become visible solids when the
wastes are cooled to 50° F. (10° C.); any petroleum oil, nonbiodegradable cutting oil or

Subchapter N, Parts 405 through 471.
Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the City Engineer may impose equivalent concentration
or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not
regulated by the same standard, the City Engineer shall impose an alternate limit using the
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove,
pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its
discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing the
categorical pretreatment standard.
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15.
§ 199-62. Special agreements.
Nothing in this article shall be construed as preventing any special agreement or arrangements

accepted into the system and specially treated subject to any payments or user charges as may be
applicable. No discharge in violation of federal and state standards and local limits will be allowed.
§ 199-63. Water and energy conservation.
The conservation of water and energy shall be encouraged by the City Engineer. In establishing
discharge restrictions upon users, he shall take into account already implemented or planned
conservation steps revealed by the user. Upon request of the City Engineer, each user shall provide
the City Engineer with pertinent information showing that the quantities of substances or pollutants
have not been nor will be increased as a result of the conservation steps. Upon such a showing to the
satisfaction of the City Engineer, he may make adjustments to discharge restrictions, which have been
based on concentrations, to reflect the conservation steps.

§ 199-64.2. Allocation of maximum allowable industrial loadings
(MAILs) as specific pollutant limitations.
The MAIL is the total daily mass of a particular pollutant that each treatment plant can accept from all
permitted users and ensure it is protecting against pass-through and interference. The no net increase
loading is the total daily mass of mercury that each treatment plant can accept from users. The MAIL
for mercury is calculated by subtracting the total daily mass of mercury allocated to all unpermitted
users from the no net increase loading for mercury. The following two tables include the MAIL that the
City of Oswego's East and West Side Wastewater Treatment Plants can accept from all permitted
users for the listed pollutants (deemed pollutants of concern) for which limits were determined to be
necessary. The tables also include the no net increase loading for mercury. In accordance with Article
IX of this chapter, and to assure that the combined total daily mass of a pollutant discharged by all
permitted users together does not exceed the MAIL, the City Engineer shall issue wastewater
discharge permits to users, including mass limits and concentration limits as follows except as
otherwise specified in this section.
Mass limits.
Except as otherwise specified in this section (e.g., more stringent federal categorical mass
limits apply, etc.), each permit shall restrict the discharge from each permitted user to a
portion of the MAIL listed below for each listed pollutant using a mass limit. In determining
what portion of the MAIL each user shall be allowed to discharge, the City Engineer shall
consider:
Historical discharge trends;
Past pollution control efforts of each user as compared to other dischargers of the same
pollutant;
Potential for growth in the POTW services area;

Potential for more restrictive regulatory requirements to be placed on the POTW
discharge or sludge disposal method; and
Treatability of the pollutant.
These mass limits are applicable to wastewater effluents at the point just prior to discharge
into the POTW and are to be applied as daily maximum limits in pounds per day.
Concentration limits.
Except as otherwise specified in this section (e.g., more stringent federal categorical
concentration limits apply, etc.), each permit shall restrict the discharge from each permitted
user to a portion of the MAIL listed below for each pollutant by including a concentration limit
in the permit based on either the uniform concentration method using the total industrial flow
or using the industrial contributory flow method using the applicable portion of industrial flow.
One method will (not both) be applied to all permitted users for a given pollutant. The basis for
establishing a concentration limit using these methods is described as follows:
A limit using the uniform concentration method based on total industrial flow is
determined by dividing the MAIL listed below for a pollutant by the total industrial flow to
allocate the MAIL among the permitted users using a conversion factor of 8.34 pounds
per milligram per liter per million gallons. The total industrial flow shall be determined by
adding the maximum flow from each permitted user.
A limit using the industrial contributory flow method is determined by dividing the MAIL
listed below for a pollutant by the portion of each permitted user's contributory flow and
by a conversion factor of 8.34 pounds per milligram per liter per million gallons. The
industrial contributory flow shall be determined by adding the maximum flow from each
permitted user that contributes the pollutant.
These concentration limits are applicable to wastewater effluents at the point just prior to
discharge into the POTW and are to be applied as daily maximum limits. These limits are to
be included in wastewater discharge permits independent of any mass-based limits as
specified in this section.
If a permitted user can demonstrate that a pollutant is not present in his or her wastewater
discharge at levels above the concentrations specified in § 199-64.1 of this article (i.e., domestic
background concentrations) and if not other limit, as specified in other sections of this article, is
applicable to the POTW discharge for that pollutant, then no limit shall be included in the
wastewater discharge permit for that pollutant and instead the limit in § 199-64.1 of this article for
that pollutant shall apply. However, for mercury, all permitted users will have a mass and
concentration limit as specified in this section.
If the MAIL for a pollutant listed below is zero, then the mass and concentration limits specified
above in this section do not apply. Instead, the limit specified in § 199-64.1 of this article (i.e.,
domestic background concentration) for that pollutant will be included in the user's permit unless
another more stringent limit is applicable to the POTW discharge, as specified in other sections of
this article, and is included in this permit. If both concentration- and mass-based limits are
included in an industrial wastewater discharge permit, both limits apply independently of each
other.
If more stringent federal categorical discharge limits apply to a permitted industrial user, per 40
CFR Parts 405 through 471 et. seq., the applicable categorical pretreatment standard will be
included in the wastewater discharge permit in place of limits specified in this section if the limits
are applied over the same duration (e.g., daily maximum, monthly average, etc.) and applied at
the same location. All unpermitted users discharging into either the East Side or West Side POTW
will be limited in their discharge of pollutants in accordance with concentration limits outlined in
§ 199-64.1 of this article. In addition, the City Engineer shall adhere to more restrictive regulatory

NOTES:
* The MAIL for mercury is calculated by subtracting the total daily mass of mercury allocated to
all unpermitted users from the no net increase loading established in the table. Mercury loadings
are subject to a no net increase requirement. A mercury monitoring and compliance program will
be implemented to evaluate and maintain compliance by the industrial users with the no net
increase requirement to both East Side and West Side Wastewater Facilities. Specific mercury
limitations will be imposed upon industrial users, and numeric MAILs will be set based upon the
results of the monitoring and compliance program.
** The no net increase loading will not be increased above this value in the future (i.e., as a result
of future local limits technical analyses).
The East Side and West Side Wastewater Facilities will incorporate mass tracking systems to
evaluate permitted industry allocations compared to the MAIL. The mass tracking program shall
be updated each time a new industry is added, when a new permit limit is established or when
there is new nonpermitted industrial or domestic growth.

State requirements and limitations on discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent
than federal requirements and limitations on those in this chapter. The New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC) Ambient Water Quality Standards (AWQS) for Mercury in
Surface Water, 6 NYCRR Part 703, are more stringent than the federal water quality standards,
USEPA Local Limits Development Guidance, Appendix D. The USEPA has required the City of
Oswego to utilize the most stringent NYSDEC mercury AWQS standard for evaluation of allowable
headworks loadings to the wastewater treatment facilities. This stringent standard results in a
nonachievable maximum allowable industrial loading (MAIL) for mercury. Therefore, until achievable
numeric limitations are developed, the no net increase in mercury loadings is required and shall not be
exceeded even after achievable numeric limitations are developed.
§ 199-66. Supplementation of limitations.
Specific pollutant limitations contained in this Part 2 may be supplemented with more stringent
limitations when, in the opinion of the City Engineer:
The limitations in this Part 2 are not sufficient to protect the POTW;
The limitations in this Part 2 are not sufficient to enable the POTW treatment plants to comply
with applicable water quality standards or the effluent limitations specified in the POTW's
SPDES permits;
The limitations in this Part 2 are not sufficient to enable the City to dispose of POTW sludge
as desired;
Municipal employees or the public will be endangered; or
Air pollution and/or groundwater pollution will be caused.
The specific pollutant limitations shall be reviewed about every five years. The results of this
review shall be reported to the Common Council. This Part 2 shall then be amended appropriately,
if necessary. Any issued industrial wastewater discharge permits which have limitations based
directly on any limitations which were changed shall be revised and amended, as appropriate.
§ 199-67. Substituting dilution for compliance prohibited.
Except where expressly authorized to do so by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement, no
user shall ever increase the use of process water or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the limitations
contained in the National Categorical Pretreatment Standards or in any other pollutant-specific
limitation developed by the City or state. The City Engineer may impose mass limitations on users who
are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in other cases when
the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.
§ 199-68. Pretreatment of wastewater.
Pretreatment facilities. Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with this
Part 2 and shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits and
the prohibitions set out in § 199-60 of this article within the time limitations specified by the EPA,
the state or the City Engineer, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities necessary for compliance
shall be provided, operated and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the City Engineer for review and shall be
acceptable to the City Engineer before such facilities are constructed. The review of such plans
and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such

facilities as necessary to produce a discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this
Part 2.
Additional pretreatment measures.
Whenever deemed necessary, the City Engineer may require users to restrict their discharge
during peak flow periods, designate that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific
sewers, relocate and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage waste streams
from industrial waste streams and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user's compliance with the requirements of this Part 2.
The City Engineer may require any person discharging into the POTW to install and maintain,
on his or her property and at his or her expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to
ensure equalization of flow. A wastewater discharge permit may be issued solely for flow
equalization.
Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the City Engineer,
they are necessary for the proper handling of wastewater containing excessive amounts of
grease and oil, or sand, except that such interceptors shall not be required for residential
users. All interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the City Engineer and
shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. Such interceptors shall
be inspected, cleaned and repaired regularly, as needed, by the user at his or her expense.
Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter.
Article X. Wastewater Dischargers
§ 199-69. Wastewater analysis.
As a means of determining compliance with this Part 2, with applicable conditions of SPDES permits
and with applicable state and federal law, all users shall be required to notify the City Engineer of any
new or existing discharges to the POTW and submit a completed industrial chemical survey (ICS) form
and a completed industrial wastewater survey (IWS) form to the City Engineer. When requested by the
City Engineer, a user must submit information on the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within
60 days of the request and update such information as the City Engineer deems necessary. All
information shall be furnished by the user in complete cooperation with the City Engineer.
§ 199-70. Notification to users.
The City Engineer shall, from time to time, notify users of applicable pretreatment standards and of
other applicable requirements under §§ 204(B) and 405 of the Clean Water Act, and Subtitles C and D
of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA).
§ 199-71. Permit required; violations.
No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into the POTW without first obtaining a
wastewater discharge permit from the City Engineer, except that a significant industrial user that
has filed a timely application pursuant to § 199-72 of this article may continue to discharge for the
time period specified therein.
The City Engineer may require other users to obtain wastewater discharge permits as necessary
to carry out the purposes of this Part 2.

The applicant shall have the burden of providing proof in a form acceptable to the
department that there are no such violations or unpaid monies.
In the event that the applicant has accrued violations or unpaid monies, such permit or
renewal thereof shall be denied regardless of whether such violations or unpaid monies
relate to a parcel of real property for which the application is made or another parcel
owned by applicant or are personal to the applicant.
In the event that the applicant has accrued violations or unpaid monies, such permit or
renewal thereof shall be denied regardless of whether such violations or unpaid monies
occurred or accrued before the effective date of this local law.
Such permit, once granted, shall be revoked in the event that the applicant accrues
violations or unpaid monies, or violations or unpaid monies are discovered, after the
permit is granted. The revocation shall take effect five business days after receipt by the
permit holder of notice from the City of Oswego of the pending revocation. Upon such
revocation, all permitted activities and privileges shall immediately cease.
No application fees shall be refunded upon revocation of the permit.
The applicant must reapply for the issuance of such revoked permit by submitting a new
application and paying all necessary application fees, and any such permitted activities or
privileges may only be resumed once a new permit has been granted.
All requirements set forth herein shall also apply to nonperson entities and such permit or
renewal thereof shall be denied to an entity, or revoked, if a person with a substantial
interest in such entity owes such unpaid monies or has accrued such violations. A
"person with a substantial interest" shall mean an ownership interest of more than 10%
of, membership on the governing board of, holding an office in or holding the ability to
cast or control more than 10% of the votes in such entity.
Notwithstanding the provisions contained in this section to the contrary, when in the opinion of
the Director of Code Enforcement the issuance of a permit is necessary to prevent harm to
life, safety, or the general welfare of the public, the Director of Code Enforcement shall be
authorized to issue said permit for the sole and exclusive purpose of bringing such violations
into compliance with the Code of the City of Oswego. Nothing contained herein shall relieve
the property owner from complying with all other applicable sections of the Code including,
without limitation, the provisions contained in this section.

§ 199-78. Permit duration.
Permits shall be issued for a specified time period, not to exceed five years from the effective date of
the permit. A permit may be issued for a period less than five years. Each permit will indicate a specific
date upon which it will expire. The user shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior
to the expiration of the user's existing permit. The terms and conditions of the permit may be subject to
modification by the City during the term of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in

proposed changes in his permit at least 30 days prior to the effective date of change.
§ 199-79. Permit transfer.
Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a specific user for a specific operation or discharge at
a specific location. A wastewater discharge permit may be transferred to a new owner or operator
only if the permittee gives at least 180 days' advance notice to the City Engineer and the City
Engineer approves the wastewater discharge permit transfer. The notice to the City Engineer must
include a written certification by the new owner or operator which:
States that the new owner and/or operator has no immediate intent to change the facility's
operations and processes;
Identifies the specific date on which the transfer is to occur; and
Acknowledges full responsibility for complying with the existing wastewater discharge permit.
Failure to provide advance notice of a transfer renders the wastewater discharge permit void as of
the date of facility transfer.
§ 199-80. Permit revocation.
The City Engineer may revoke a wastewater discharge permit for good cause, including but not
limited to the following reasons:
Failure to notify the City Engineer of significant changes to the wastewater prior to the
changed discharge.
Failure to provide prior notification to the City Engineer of changed conditions pursuant to
§ 199-81E of this article.
Misrepresentation or failure to fully disclose all relevant facts in the wastewater discharge
permit application.
Falsifying self-monitoring reports.
Tampering with monitoring equipment.
Refusing to allow the City Engineer timely access to the facility premises and records.
Failure to meet effluent limitations.
Failure to pay fines.
Failure to pay user charges.

reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be
analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in § 199-86 of this article.
Sampling must be performed in accordance with procedures set out in § 199-86 of
this article.
Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified
by a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a
consistent basis and, if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or
additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements.
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment and/or O&M will be required to meet the
pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such
additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be
later than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A
compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in
§ 199-81B of this article.
Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in
accordance with § 199-75 of this article.
Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions shall apply to the compliance
schedule required by § 199-81A(2)(g) of this article:
The schedule shall contain progress increments in the forms of dates for the commencement
and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional
pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such
events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction
and beginning and conducting routine operation);
No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;
The user shall submit a progress report to the City Engineer no later than 14 days following
each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance, including, as a minimum, whether
or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and, if appropriate,
the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the City
Engineer.
Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. Within 90 days following
the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a
new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user
subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the City Engineer a
report containing the information described in § 199-81A(2)(d) through (f) of this article. For users
subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures
in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term
production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in
terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this
report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All
compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 199-75 of this article.

and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All
periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 199-75 of this
article.
All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring
facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are
unrepresentative of its discharge.
If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more
frequently than required by the City Engineer, using the procedures prescribed in § 199-86 of
this article, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the City Engineer of any planned significant
changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality or volume of its
wastewater at least 90 days before the change.
The City Engineer may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed
necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater
discharge permit application under § 199-74 of this article.
The City Engineer may issue a wastewater discharge permit under § 199-74D of this article or
modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under § 199-77B of this article in response to
changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions.
For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow
increases of 20% or greater and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants.
Reports of potential problems.
In the case of any discharge, including but not limited to accidental discharges, discharges of
a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge or a slug load, that may cause
potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the City
Engineer of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of
waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user.
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the City Engineer,
submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to
be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve
the user of any expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall
such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties or other liability which may be
imposed pursuant to this Part 2.
A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place
advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in Subsection F(1)
above. Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur
are advised of the emergency notification procedure.
Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit
shall provide appropriate reports to the City Engineer as the City Engineer may require.
Notice of violation/report sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a
violation, the user must notify the City Engineer within 24 hours of becoming aware of the
violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat
analysis to the City Engineer within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not
required to resample if the City Engineer monitors at the user's facility at least once a month or if

the City Engineer samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the
results of this sampling.
Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.
Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA
Regional Waste Management Division Director and NYSDEC, in writing, of any discharge into
the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under
40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set
forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of discharge
(continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste
per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information
to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of
the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and
concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month
and an estimation of the mass constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged
during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after
the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only
once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions
must be submitted under § 199-81E of this article. The notification requirement in this section
does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of § 199-81 A, C and D of this article.
Discharges are exempt from the requirements of Subsection I(1) above during a calendar
month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes unless the
wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e).
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month or of
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261:30(d) and 261.33(e)
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification.
In the case of any new regulations under § 3001 of RCRA identifying additional
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste,
the user must notify the City Engineer, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director and NYSDEC of the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date
of such regulations.
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the
degree it has determined to be economically practical.
This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to
be discharged by this Part 2, a permit issued thereunder or any applicable federal or state
law.
Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For
reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States
Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern.
Recordkeeping. users subject to the reporting requirements of this Part 2 shall retain and make
available for inspection and copying all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring
activities required by this Part 2 and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall
include the date, exact place, method and time of sampling and the name of the person(s) taking
the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical
techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain
available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automatically extended for the

duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City or where the user has been specifically
notified of a longer retention period by the City Engineer.
§ 199-82. Flow equalization.
No person shall cause the discharge of slugs to the POTW. Each person discharging into the POTW
greater than 100,000 gallons per day or greater than 5% of the average daily flow in the POTW,
whichever is less, shall install and maintain on his property and at his expense a suitable storage and
flow-control facility to ensure equalization of flow over a twenty-four-hour period. The facility shall have
a capacity for at least 50% of the daily discharge volume and shall be equipped with alarms and a rate
of discharge controller, the regulation of which shall be directed by the City Engineer. A wastewater
discharge permit may be issued solely for flow equalization.
§ 199-83. Monitoring facilities.
When required by the City Engineer, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying wastewater discharges that have caused or may cause interference or pass-through shall
install and maintain suitable access and such necessary meters or other appurtenances in the
building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of the wastewater. Such
access shall be in a readily and safely accessible location and shall be provided in accordance
with plans approved by the City Engineer. The access shall be provided and maintained at the
owner's expense so as to be safe and accessible at reasonable times.
If there is more than one building sewer serving a user, the City Engineer may require the
installation of a control manhole on each building sewer.
The City Engineer may require that such monitoring facilities include equipment for the
continuous measurement and recording of wastewater flow rate and for the sampling of the
wastewater.
The City may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user,
allow the monitoring facilities to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so
that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.
The City Engineer shall consider such factors as the volume and strength of the discharge, POTW
treatment plant removal capabilities, rate of discharge, qualities of toxic materials in the discharge
and cost effectiveness in determining whether or not access and equipment for monitoring the
wastewater discharge shall be required.
Where the City Engineer determines access and equipment for monitoring or measuring the
wastewater discharges is not practicable, reliable or cost effective, the City Engineer may specify
alternative methods of determining the characteristics of the wastewater's discharge which will, in
the City Engineer's judgment, provide an equitable measurement of such characteristics.
§ 199-84. Pretreatment and flow equalization facilities; monitoring
stations.
Users shall provide necessary wastewater treatment as required to comply with this Part 2 and
shall achieve compliance with all National Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time
limitations as specified by the Code of Federal Regulations. Any facilities required to pretreat
wastewater to acceptable levels to the City shall be provided, operated and maintained at the
user's expense.

Preliminary treatment and flow equalization facilities or monitoring stations, if provided for any
wastewater, shall be constructed and maintained continuously clean, safe and operational by the
owner at his expense. Where an industrial user has such treatment, equalization or monitoring
facilities at the time this Part 2 is enacted, the City Engineer may approve or disapprove the
adequacy of such facilities. Where the City Engineer disapproves of such facilities and
construction of new or upgraded facilities for treatment, equalization or monitoring are required,
plans and specifications for such facilities shall be prepared by a state-licensed professional
engineer and submitted to the City Engineer.
§ 199-85. Vandalism and/or tampering prohibited.
No unauthorized person shall negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, tamper with,
prevent access to or render inaccurate or cause or permit the negligent breaking, damaging,
destroying, uncovering or defacing of tampering with, preventing access to or rendering inaccurate of
any measuring, sampling and/or testing device or mechanism installed pursuant to any requirement
under this Part 2, except as approved by the City Engineer.
§ 199-86. Sampling and analysis.
Sample collection.
Except as indicated in Subsection A(2) below, the user must collect wastewater samples
using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event that flow proportional
samples are infeasible, the City Engineer may authorize the use of time proportional sampling
or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a
representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits.
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic
compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques.
Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as
part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with
the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 unless otherwise specified in an applicable
categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance
with procedures approved by the EPA.
§ 199-87. Accidental discharges; SPCC plan.
The City Engineer may require any user to develop, submit for approval and implement a plan to
provide for protection from accidental or slug discharges of prohibited materials or discharges of
materials in volume or concentration exceeding limitations of this Part 2 or of any wastewater
discharge permit. At least once every two years, the City Engineer shall evaluate whether each
significant industrial user needs an accidental or slug discharge control plan. Users shall
immediately notify the City Engineer of the discharge of wastes in violation of this Part 2 or any
permit. Such discharges may result from the breakdown of pretreatment equipment, accidents
caused by mechanical failure or negligence or other causes.
Where possible, such immediate notification shall allow the City Engineer to initiate appropriate
counter-measure action at the POTW. The user shall prepare a detailed written statement
following any accidental or slug discharge which describes the causes of the discharge and the
measures being taken to prevent future occurrences within five days of the occurrence, and the
City Engineer shall receive a copy of such report no later than the fifth calendar day following the

occurrence. Analytical results and their interpretation may be appended to the report at a date not
exceeding 45 calendar days after the occurrence.
When required by the City Engineer, detailed plans and procedures to prevent accidental or slug
discharges shall be submitted to the City Engineer for approval. These plans and procedures shall
be called a "Slug Prevention, Control and Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan." The plan shall address,
at a minimum, the following:
Description of discharge practices, including nonroutine batch discharges;
Description of stored chemicals;
Procedures for immediately notifying the POTW of any accidental or slug discharge. Such
notification must also be given for any discharge which would violate any provision of the
permit and any prohibited discharge standards;
Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling, and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants (including solvents) and/or measures and equipment for
emergency response.
§ 199-88. Posting notices.
In order that the industrial user's employees be informed of the City's requirements, a notice shall be
permanently posted on appropriate bulletin boards within the user's facility advising employees of the
City's requirements and whom to call in case of an accidental discharge in violation of this Part 2.
§ 199-89. Sample splitting.
When so requested in advance by an industrial user and when taking a sample of industrial
wastewater, the City representative(s) shall gather sufficient volume of sample so that the sample can
be split into two nearly equal volumes, each of a size adequate for the anticipated analytical protocols,
including any quality control (QC) procedures. One of the volumes shall be given to the industry whose
wastewater was sampled and the other shall be retained by the City for its own analysis.
§ 199-90. Confidential information.
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits
and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the release of such information would divulge
information, processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the
information or data.
When requested and demonstrated by the person furnishing a report that the information obtained
in Subsection A above should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public but shall
be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to this
Part 2, the NPDES/SPDES program or pretreatment program and in enforcement proceedings
involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics, reports of

§ 199-91. Compliance monitoring.
Right of entry: inspection and sampling. The City Engineer shall have the right to enter the
premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all requirements of this Part
2 and any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the City
Engineer ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
records examination and copying and the performance of any additional duties.
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its
security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the City Engineer will be
permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
The City Engineer shall have the right to set up on the user's property or require installation of
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
The City Engineer may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated once per year to ensure their accuracy.
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal
request of the City Engineer and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the user.
Unreasonable delays in allowing the City Engineer access to the user's premises shall be a
violation of this Part 2.
Search warrants. If the City Engineer has been refused access to a building, structure or property,
or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this Part 2 or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program of the City designed to verify compliance with this Part 2 or any
permit or order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the
community, then the City Engineer may seek issuance of a search warrant from the City Court of
the City of Oswego.
§ 199-92. Liability of property owner.
During the performance, on private premises, of inspections, sampling or other similar operations
referred to in § 199-91 of this article, said representatives shall observe all applicable safety rules
established by the owner or occupant of the premises. The owner and/or occupant shall be held
harmless for personal injury or death of the representatives and the loss of or damage to the
representative's supplies and/or equipment; and the representative shall indemnify the owner and/or
occupant against loss or damage to property of the owner or occupant by the representative and
against liability claims asserted against the owner or occupant for personal injury or death of the

Prevent the equitable compensation to the City for wastewater conveyance and treatment and
sludge management and disposal.
No discharge in violation of federal and state standards and local limits will be allowed under the
terms of such special agreements.
§ 199-94. Publication of users in significant noncompliance.
The City Engineer shall publish annually, in the largest daily newspaper published in the City, a list of
the users which, during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. The term "significant noncompliance" is defined in Article II,
§ 199-8, of this Part 2.
§ 199-95. Effect of federal law.
In the event that the federal government promulgates a regulation for a given new or existing user in a
specific industrial subcategory that establishes pretreatment standards or establishes that such a user
is exempt from pretreatment standards, such federal regulations shall immediately supersede
applicable sections of this article.
§ 199-96. Revision of pretreatment standards.
The City Engineer shall promptly apply for and obtain authorization from the EPA to revise discharge
limitations for those substances listed in the Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards for which
consistent removal occurs in the POTW treatment plant of the City. The City Engineer shall not adopt
or enforce discharge limitations more stringent than the requested limitations until the state or EPA
acts on the application.

for such action and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action
should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or
certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 10 days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be
served on any authorized representative of the user. A show-cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
Compliance orders. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate
any provision of this Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may issue an order to the user
responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into compliance within a specified time.
If the user does not come into compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be
discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to
address the noncompliance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices
designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may
not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or requirement nor
does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing
violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
Cease-and-desist orders.
When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the
City Engineer may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such
violations and directing the user to:
Immediately comply with all requirements; and
Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or
terminating the discharge.
Issuance of a cease-and-desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against the user.
Administrative fines.
When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any provision of
this Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may fine such user in an amount not
to exceed $1,000. Such fines shall be assessed on a per-violation-per-day basis. In the case
of monthly or other long-term average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day
during the period of violation.

Unpaid charges, fines and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional
penalty of 10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of 1.5%
per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines and
penalties.
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the City Engineer to
reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within 15 days of being notified
of the fine. Where a request has merit, the City Engineer may convene a hearing on the
matter. In the event that the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any
interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The City Engineer may add the costs
of preparing administrative enforcement actions such as notices and orders to the fine.
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any
other action against the user.
Emergency suspensions. The City Engineer may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or
threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The City Engineer may also immediately
suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere
with the operation of the POTW or which presents, or may present, an endangerment to the
environment.
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or eliminate its
contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the
suspension order, the City Engineer may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW,
its receiving stream or endangerment to any individuals. The City Engineer may allow the
user to recommence its discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer that the period of endangerment has passed, unless the termination
proceedings in Subsection H of this section are initiated against the user.
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the City Engineer
prior to the date of any show-cause or termination hearing under Subsections C and D of this
section.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency
suspension under this section.
Termination of discharge.
In addition to the provisions in § 199-80 of this Part 2, any user who violates the following
conditions is subject to discharge termination:
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;
Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of its
discharge;
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constituents
and characteristics prior to discharge;
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection,
monitoring or sampling; or
Violation of the pretreatment standards in Article IX of this Part 2.

Such user will be notified of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under Subsection C of this section why the proposed action should
not be taken. Exercise of this option by the City Engineer shall not be a bar to, or a
prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.
§ 199-99. Judicial remedies.
Injunctive relief. When the City Engineer finds that a user has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the City Engineer may petition the Court of the City of
Oswego through the City Attorney for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which restrains or compels the specific performance of the wastewater discharge
permit, order or other requirement imposed by this Part 2 on activities of the user. The City
Engineer may also seek such other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief,
including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for injunctive
relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.
Civil penalties.
A user who has violated or continues to violate any provision of this Part 2, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement shall be liable to the City for a maximum civil penalty of $1,000 per violation, per
day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average discharge limit, penalties shall
accrue for each day during the period of the violation.
The City may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs and other expenses associated
with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by the City.
In determining the amount of civil liability, the court shall take into account all relevant
circumstances, including but not limited to the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user and any other
factor as justice requires.
Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against a user.
Criminal prosecution.
A user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Part 2, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement shall,
upon conviction, be guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of not less than
$500 nor more than $1,000 per violation, per day, or imprisonment for not more than one
year, or both.
A user who willfully or negligently introduces any substances into the POTW which causes
personal injury or property damage shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor and be subject to a penalty of not more than $1,000 or be subject to
imprisonment for not more than one year, or both. This penalty shall be in addition to any
other cause of action for personal injury or property damage available under state law.
A user who knowingly makes any false statements, representations or certifications in any
application, record, report, plan or other documentation filed or required to be maintained
pursuant to this Part 2, wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or who
falsifies, tampers with or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or method

Remedies nonexclusive. The remedies provided for in this Part 2 are not exclusive. The City
Engineer may take any, all or any combination of these actions against a noncompliant user.
Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be in accordance with the City's enforcement
response plan. However, the City Engineer may take other action against any user when the
circumstances warrant. Further, the City Engineer is empowered to take more than one
enforcement action against any noncompliant user.
§ 199-100. Supplemental enforcement action.
Performance bonds. The City Engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Part 2, a previous
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, unless such user first files a satisfactory bond payable to the City in a sum not to
exceed a value determined by the City Engineer to be necessary to achieve consistent
compliance.
Liability insurance. The City Engineer may decline to issue or reissue a wastewater discharge
permit to any user who has failed to comply with any provision of this Part 2, a previous
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement unless the user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances sufficient
to restore or repair damage to the POTW caused by its discharge.
Water supply severance. Whenever a user has violated and continues to violate any provision of
this Part 2, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, water service to the user may be severed. Service will only recommence,
at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demonstrated its ability to comply.

of current market value of the property at the time of its first use within this city. The value of
such property for compensating use tax purposes may not exceed its cost.
The compensating use tax on such tangible personal property brought into this city (other
than for complete consumption or for incorporation into real property located in this city and
used in the performance of a contract or subcontract within this city by a purchaser or user for
a period of less than six months) may be based, at the option of the taxpayer, on the fair

at such times and in such amounts as may be prescribed by the State Tax Commission as
provided in § 1132 of the Tax Law.

a sale or compensating use tax was paid to this state and any of its municipal corporations. For
the purpose of this subsection, a payment to the State Tax Commission of a tax imposed by a
municipal corporation shall be deemed a payment to such municipal corporation. To the extent
that a compensating use tax imposed pursuant to this Article and the compensating use tax
imposed by Article 28 of the Tax Law are at a higher aggregate rate than the rate of tax imposed in

Article or resulted from the acceptance by a governmental agency of a bid accompanied by a

services subject to tax under § 224-2C(1), (2), (3) and (5) and such property has become a
physical component part of the property upon which the services are performed or has been

No. 4-2018]
§ 224-16. Exemption.
Pursuant to Real Property Tax Law § 485-b, real property constructed, altered, installed or
improved subsequent to the first day of July, 2016, for the purpose of commercial, business or
industrial activity shall be exempt from taxation and special ad valorem levies, except for special
ad valorem levies for fire district, fire protection district and fire alarm district purposes, to the
extent hereinafter provided.
Such real property shall be exempt for a period of one year to the extent of 50% of the increase in
assessed value thereof attributable to such construction, alteration, installation or improvement
and for an additional period of nine years; provided, however, that the extent of such exemption
shall be decreased by 5% each year during such additional period of nine years, and such
exemption shall be computed with respect to the "exemption base." The exemption base shall be
the increase in assessed value as determined in the initial year of such ten-year period, following
the filing of an original application, except as provided in Subsection B(2).
In any year in which a change in the level of assessment of 15% or more is certified for a final
assessment roll pursuant to the rules of the State Board, the exemption base shall be
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the total assessed value of the parcel
on such final assessment roll (after accounting for any physical or quantity changes to the
parcel since the immediately preceding assessment roll), and the denominator of which shall
be the total assessed value of the parcel on the immediately preceding final assessment roll.
The result shall be the new exemption base. The exemption shall thereupon be recomputed
to take into account the new exemption base, notwithstanding the fact that the Assessor
receives the certification of the change in level of assessment after the completion,
verification and filing of the final assessment roll. In the event the Assessor does not have
custody of the roll when such certification is received, the Assessor shall certify the
recomputed exemption to the local officers having custody and control of the roll, and such
local officers are hereby directed and authorized to enter the recomputed exemption certified
by the Assessor on the roll. The Assessor shall give written notice of such recomputed
exemption to the property owner, who may, if he or she believes that the exemption was
recomputed incorrectly, apply for a correction in the manner provided by Title 3 of Article 5 of
the New York State Real Property Tax Law for the correction of clerical errors.

No such exemption shall be granted unless:
Such construction, alteration, installation or improvement was commenced
subsequent to the first day of January, 2016;
The cost of such construction, alteration, installation or improvement exceeds the
sum of $10,000; and
Such construction, alteration, installation or improvement is completed as may be
evidenced by a certificate of occupancy or other appropriate documentation as

For purposes of this section, the terms "construction," "alteration," "installation" and
"improvements" shall not include ordinary maintenance and repairs.
No such exemption shall be granted concurrent with or subsequent to any other real
property tax exemption granted to the same improvements to real property, except,
where during the period of such previous exemption, payments in lieu of taxes or other
payments were made to the local government in an amount that would have been equal
to or greater than the amount of real property taxes that would have been paid on such
improvements had such property been granted an exemption pursuant to this section. In
such case, an exemption shall be granted for a number of years equal to the ten-year
exemption granted pursuant to this section, less the number of years the property would
have been previously exempt from real property taxes.
Such exemption shall be granted only upon application by the owner of such real property on a
form prescribed by the State Board. Such application shall be filed with the Assessor of the City of
Oswego on or before the appropriate taxable status date of the City of Oswego and within one
year from the date of completion of such construction, alteration, installation or improvement.
If the Assessor is satisfied that the applicant is entitled to an exemption pursuant to this section,
he or she shall approve the application, and such real property shall thereafter be exempt from
taxation and special ad valorem levies, except for special ad valorem levies for Fire District, Fire
Protection District and Fire Alarm District purposes, as herein provided, commencing with the
assessment roll prepared after the taxable status date referred to in Subsection C of this section.
The assessed value of any exemption granted pursuant to this section shall be entered by the
Assessor on the assessment roll with the taxable property, with the amount of the exemption
shown in a separate column.

Where the title is vested in either the husband or wife, their combined income may not exceed
such sum, except as provided in § 467 of the New York Real Property Tax Law.
Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain
from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or
exchange of a capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings and
net income from self-employment, but shall not include return of capital, gifts or inheritances or
moneys earned through employment in the federal foster grandparent program. In computing net
rental income and net income from self-employment, no depreciation deduction shall be allowed
for the exhaustion, wear and tear of real or personal property held for the production of income.
Except as is otherwise provided in § 467 of the New York Real Property Tax Law, the title must
have been vested in the name of the owner or all of the owners of the property for at least 24
consecutive months prior to the date of the making of the application for exemption.
The property must also be used exclusively for residential purposes and be the legal residence of
and occupied in whole or in part by the owner or by all the owners of the property, except as is
otherwise provided in § 467 of the New York Real Property Tax Law.
The application for such exemption must be made by the owner or one of the owners of the
property, on a form prescribed by the State of New York, and shall furnish the required information
and be properly executed and shall be filed in the Assessor's office of the City of Oswego, New
York, on or before the appropriate taxable status date.
Pursuant to the Real Property Tax Law § 467, Subdivision 6, at least 60 days prior to the
appropriate taxable status date, the assessing authority shall mail to each person who was
granted exemption pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll an application
form and a notice that such application must be billed on or before taxable status date and be
approved in order for the exemption to be granted. The assessing authority shall, within three days
of the completion and filing of the tentative assessment roll, notify by mail any applicant who has
included with his application at least one self-addressed, prepaid envelope of the approval or
denial of the application; provided, however, that the assessing authority shall, upon the receipt
and filing of the application, send by mail notification of receipt to any applicant who has included
two of such envelopes with the application. Where an applicant is entitled to a notice of denial
pursuant to this subsection, such notice shall be on a form prescribed by the State Board and shall
state the reasons for such denial and shall further state that the applicant may have such
determination reviewed in the manner provided by law. Failure to mail any such application form or
notices or the failure of such persons to receive any of the same shall not prevent the levy,
collection and enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property owned by such person.
Any exemption provided by this article shall be computed after all other partial exemptions allowed
by law have been subtracted from the total amount assessed.
The real property tax exemption on real property owned by husband and wife, one of whom is 65
years of age or over, once granted, shall not be rescinded solely because of the death of the older
spouse so long as the surviving spouse is at least 62 years of age.
Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the application for such exemption
noted above shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant

exemption has been granted increases or decreases as the result of a revaluation or update of
assessments and a material change in level of assessment, as provided in the Real Property Tax
Law, is certified for the assessment roll pursuant to the rules of the State Board, the Assessor
shall increase or decrease the amount of such exemption by multiplying the amount of such

amount of exemption as recomputed pursuant to this subsection and such local Assessor is
hereby directed and authorized to enter the recomputed exemption on the roll.

exemption pursuant to § 458. The Assessor shall recompute all exemptions granted pursuant to
this section by multiplying the amount of each such exemption by the cumulative change in level
of assessment certified by the State Board measured from the assessment roll immediately
preceding the assessment roll on which exemptions were first granted pursuant to § 458-a;
provided, however, that if an exemption pursuant to this section was initially granted to a parcel on
a later assessment roll, the cumulative change in level factor to be used in recomputing the
exemption shall be measured from the assessment roll immediately preceding the assessment roll
on which that exemption was initially granted. No refunds or retroactive entitlements shall be
granted.
Such adjustments shall be made by the Assessor in the manner provided in § 458, Subdivision
1(3), of the Real Property Tax Law, and, except as provided in Subsection B herein, no application
need be filed by or on behalf of any owner of any eligible property.

§ 253-1. Purpose.
The seriousness of the outdoor storage of abandoned, junked, discarded and unlicensed motor
vehicles upon City property, City streets, and privately owned land within the City of Oswego increases
with each passing month. The outdoor storage of such vehicles constitutes an attractive nuisance to
children and a peril to safety, depreciates neighborhoods and is unsightly for adjoining property
owners.
§ 253-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter and throughout the City Code, the following words shall have the
meanings indicated:
JUNKED, ABANDONED OR DISCARDED MOTOR VEHICLE
Any automobile, motor vehicle, truck, or vehicle of any type, as further defined in Article 1 of
the Vehicle and Traffic Law, that fits any of the following criteria: uninspected, unregistered,
without valid license plates or otherwise not in physical condition for use on public
thoroughfares. This shall also include any portion of said motor vehicle, such as the trailer of
a tractor trailer, or the rear section of a multi-wheeled vehicle.
Exceptions to this section will be granted only to new- and used-car sales establishments duly
licensed and approved to do business in the City of Oswego and the State of New York and at
registered motor vehicle repair shops when such storage is temporary in nature. For the purpose
of this section, "temporary" shall mean only that length of time that is absolutely necessary to
perform the automotive repairs causing the vehicle to be in such storage.
§ 253-3. Storage on City property.
The storage or parking of any junked motor vehicle, as defined by this chapter, is strictly prohibited on
any City street or vacant property owned by the City of Oswego. When speaking of a City street in
conjunction with this chapter, the word "street" is not confined to the paved roadway but encompasses
all property owned and controlled by the City of Oswego from building line to building line on any City
street or thoroughfare.
§ 253-4. Storage on private property.
The storage of any automobile, motor vehicle, truck or vehicle of any type that qualifies as junked,
abandoned or discarded, under this chapter, on any private property within the confines of the City of
Oswego shall constitute a violation of this chapter. Such junked or abandoned vehicles shall be stored
in an enclosed garage or placed in licensed junkyards that are licensed by the City and designated for
that purpose.

calendar days, it will result in the vehicle being removed by the City of Oswego and the costs
associated thereof shall be assessed against the owner of the vehicle, in accordance with § 257-
68 of the Vehicle and Traffic Law of the City of Oswego. After the removal of any vehicle as
provided in this article, the vehicle shall be stored in a suitable place at the expense of the owner.
For the purpose of this section, a "suitable place" shall be deemed to mean a properly fenced-in
area owned or maintained by the City or a privately owned fenced-in area for which a towing
company has provided a bond and evidence of insurance in the minimum amount of $1,000,000
naming the City of Oswego as an additional named insured on such policy. The Traffic Section
shall maintain a list of such suitable places. A storage charge shall be $100 per day. Such charge
shall be in addition to any fine payable for violation of laws, ordinances, rules or regulations.
Any property owner, occupant, lessee, agent or tenant who shall refuse and neglect to remove the
abandoned, junked, discarded and unlicensed motor vehicle, as directed by this chapter, or shall
otherwise violate the provisions of this chapter, or who shall resist or obstruct the agents of the
City from removing the vehicle(s) involved, shall be subject to a fine not to exceed $1,000 for each
violation of this chapter.

which apply specifically to the winter parking ban and agrees to abide by them.
The applicant is aware that the permit may be revoked at any time by the
Chamberlain's office, at the request of the Councilor for that ward, for a violation of
those parking regulations and that, in the event of a revocation on the basis of such
a violation, the applicant will not be entitled to a reimbursement of any part of the fee
paid for the parking permit.
The applicant waives any and all rights, and holds the City harmless and indemnifies
the City, for any damage occurring to or caused by the vehicle of the applicant,
whether due to the plowing of the streets by the City or otherwise, while parked on a
City street in exercise of the permission to park pursuant to the parking permit.
The applicant acknowledges that granting of permission to park on the street is not a
right or privilege, but rather a revocable license issued by the City, and that the
granting of a permit for one winter season does not guarantee that the permit holder
will receive a permit for the following or any subsequent winter season and the
applicant waives all right to make any claim of detrimental reliance.

There must be sufficient road frontage to allow the applicant to park in a designated
spot without blocking existing driveways or crosswalks. If, in the opinion of the
Commissioner of the Department of Public Works, there is insufficient space on the
street to accommodate all of the vehicles for which applications have been
submitted, the Commissioner may locate the permitted parking space in the nearest
location that allows for the safe egress of emergency vehicles and the efficient
clearing of snow as outlined below. If there is still not enough space to accommodate
the applications received, the Commissioner shall first deny applications by
applicants who already have sufficient space in their driveway or parking lot to park

vehicles for which applications have been submitted, residents to whom parking
permits shall be issued shall be chosen by a lottery to be conducted by the
Commissioner.
The application shall be submitted to the Chamberlain's office. The Chamberlain shall
distribute a copy of the application to the Department of Public Works and to the
Councilor of the ward in which the property is located for review and approval by the
Commissioner of the Department of Public Works.
Applications may be submitted between August 1 and November 1 of each year. The
Common Council may change the annual application acceptance period by resolution.
The application acceptance period for the preceding year shall remain in effect unless
and until the Common Council adopts a new acceptance period by resolution.
The application shall require the approval of the Commissioner of the Department of
Public Works. If the application receives the approval of the Commissioner of the
Department of Public Works, the Chamberlain shall issue the parking permit to the
applicant for the vehicle described in the application.
The permit shall be granted only for the one winter season for which it was issued and
shall expire at the end of that season. There shall be no reimbursement of any part of the
application fee if the Mayor ends the winter parking ban before March 31.
If the permit holder sells or otherwise transfers the vehicle for which the permit was
issued, the permit shall be revoked and there shall be no reimbursement of the

and other devices, violators frequently are able to evade existing enforcement measures.
By reason of the foregoing, the City of Oswego finds that the health, welfare and safety will be
served by adoption of an ordinance providing additional means of enforcing parking orders, rules,
regulations, ordinances and local laws in the case of vehicle owners who fail to timely respond to
summonses (tickets) issued for parking violations.
The Chief of Police or his/ her designee is hereby authorized to provide for the removal of and/or
immobilization of vehicles against which three or more parking summonses (tickets) have been
issued if three or more of such summonses (tickets) have not been answered within 60 days of the
issuance date or dates shown on such summonses (tickets).
Any such vehicle found to be operating or parked on any Oswego City street, highway or parking
area may be removed under the direction of the Police Department. In addition to, or in lieu of,
towing, any such vehicle may be immobilized in such manner as to prevent its operation, except
that no such vehicle shall be immobilized by any means other than by the use of a device or other
mechanism which will cause no damage to such vehicle unless it is moved while such device or
mechanism is in place. In any case involving immobilization of a vehicle pursuant to this
subsection, such member of the Police Department shall cause to be placed on such vehicle, in a
conspicuous manner, notice sufficient to warn any individual to the effect that any attempt to move
such vehicle might result in damage to such vehicle.
If full payment of the outstanding fines for parking violations is not made by 5:00 p.m. on the day
the vehicle is immobilized by a "boot" device, the Police Department may have the vehicle
removed by towing or other means, and the registered owner would also be responsible for towing
and storage fees.
Release of vehicle. Before the owner or person in charge of any vehicle taken into custody, or
immobilized as above provided, shall be allowed to repossess or to secure the release of said
vehicle, the owner or his/her agent shall pay, in cash or certified check, or the posting of a security
bond, the following:
To the City of Oswego: all sums legally due for parking fines issued against such vehicle and
any motor vehicle registered in the name of the registered owner of the impounded motor
vehicle.
To the City of Oswego: a fee as set out in § 257-72C for the application and removal of said
boot or immobilization device placed on such vehicle.
To the towing service: the cost of towing and storage as set out in § 257-72B, if applicable.
If, after a vehicle has been towed or immobilized, any person shall remove such vehicle without
complying with Subsection F(1) or shall do any damage to the immobilization device, then the

device or mechanism and in addition, be subject to a fine of not more than $100. In the event that
the damages caused to the immobilization device or mechanism renders the said immobilization
device or mechanism unable to be used again, then the person(s) damaging said immobilization
device or mechanism shall be charged with a felony and shall be liable for the damages done to
the immobilization device or mechanism and, in addition, be subject to a fine of not more than
$500.
The owner of such vehicle may, as a defense to this Subsection G, plead and prove that at
the time of such removal or damage, such vehicle was stolen, but only if, prior to such act or
acts, notice of a stolen vehicle had been given to the applicable police authority.
§ 257-72. Storage; charges; fees.
After the removal of any vehicle as provided in this article, or in accordance with any other law,
ordinance, rule or regulation governing the same, the vehicle shall be stored in a suitable place at
the expense of the owner. For the purpose of this section, a "suitable place" shall be deemed to
mean a properly fenced-in area owned or maintained by the city or a privately owned fenced-in
area for which a towing company has provided a bond and evidence of insurance in an amount
deemed satisfactory by the City Attorney. A list of such suitable places shall be maintained by the
Traffic Section.
[Amended 5-29-2012]

SUPERINTENDENT OF WATER
The Superintended, or his delegated representative in charge of the Oswego Department of
Water, is invested with the authority and responsibility for the implementation of a crossconnection
control program and for the enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance.
§ 263-7. Administration of program.
The Department will operate a cross-connection control program, to include the keeping of
necessary records, which fulfills the requirements of the Commission's Cross-connection
Regulations and is approved by the Commission.
The owner shall allow his property to be inspected for possible cross-connections and shall follow
the provisions of the Department's program and the Regulations if a cross-connection is permitted.
If the Department requires that the public supply be protected by containment, the owner shall be
responsible for water quality beyond the outlet end of the containment device and should utilize
fixture outlet protection for that purpose. He may utilize public health officials or personnel from the
Department or their delegated representatives to assist him in the survey of his facilities and to
assist him in the selection of proper fixture outlet devices and the proper installation of these
devices.
§ 263-8. Requirements.
Department.
On new installations, the Department will provide on-site evaluation and/or inspection of plans
in order to determine the type of backflow preventer, if any, that will be required, issue permits
and perform inspections and testing. In any case, a minimum of a dual-check valve will be
required in any new construction.
For premises existing prior to the start of this program, the Department will perform
evaluations and inspections of plans and/or premises and inform the owner by letter of any
corrective action deemed necessary, the method of achieving the correction and the time
allowed for the correction to be made. Ordinarily, ninety (90) days will be allowed; however,
this time period may be shortened depending upon the degree of hazard involved and the
history of the device(s) in question.
The Department will not allow any cross-connection to remain unless it is protected by an
approved backflow preventer for which a permit has been issued and which will be regularly
tested to ensure satisfactory operation.
The Department shall inform the owner by letter, of any failure to comply, by the time of the
first reinspection. The Department will allow an additional fifteen (15) days for the correction.
In the event that the owner fails to comply with the necessary correction by the time of the
second reinspection, the Department will inform the owner, by letter, that the water service to
the owner's premises will be terminated within a period not to exceed five (5) days. In the
event that the owner informs the Department of extenuating circumstances as to why the
correction has not been made, a time extension may be granted by the Department, but in no
case will exceed an additional thirty (30) days.
If the Department determines at any time that a serious threat to the public health exists, the
water service will be terminated immediately.
The Department shall have on file a list of private contractors who are certified backflow
device testers. All charges for these tests will be paid by the owner of the building or property.

The Department will begin initial premises inspections to determine the nature of existing or
potential hazards following the approval of this program during the calendar year 1994. Initial
focus will be on high-hazard industries and commercial premises.
Owner.
The owner shall be responsible for the elimination or protection of all cross-connections on his
premises.
The owner, after having been informed by a letter from the Department, shall, at his expense,
install, maintain, and test or have tested any and all backflow preventers on his premises.
The owner shall correct any malfunction of the backflow preventer which is revealed by
periodic testing.
The owner shall inform the Department of any proposed or modified cross-connections and
also any existing cross-connections of which the owner is aware but has not been found by
the Department.
The owner shall not install a bypass around any backflow preventer unless there is a backflow
preventer of the same type on the bypass. owners who cannot shut down operation for testing
of the device(s) must supply additional devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
The owner shall install backflow preventers in a manner approved by the Department.
The owner shall install only backflow preventers approved by the Department.
Any owner having a private well or other private water source must have a permit if the well or
source is cross-connected to the Department's system. Permission to cross-connect may be
denied by the Department. The owner may be required to install a backflow preventer at the
service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even if it is not cross-connected to
the Department's system.
In the event that the owner installs plumbing to provide potable water for domestic purposes
which is on the Department's side of the backflow preventer, such plumbing must have its
own backflow preventer installed.
The owner shall be responsible for the payment of all fees for permits, annual or semiannual
device testing, retesting, in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and second
reinspections for noncompliance with Department requirements.
§ 263-9. Degree of hazard.
The Department recognizes the threat to the public water system arising from cross-connections. All
threats will be classified by degree of hazard and will require the installation of approved reduced
pressure principle backflow prevention devices or double-check valves.
§ 263-10. Permits.
The Department shall not permit a cross-connection within the public water supply system, unless
it is considered necessary and that it cannot be eliminated.
Cross-connection permits that are required for each backflow prevention device are obtained from
the Department. A fee of twenty-five dollars ($25.) will be charged for the initial permit and twentyfive
dollars ($25.) for the renewal of each permit.

Permits shall be renewed every three (3) years and are nontransferable. Permits are subject to
revocation and become immediately revoked if the owner should so change the type of crossconnection
or degree of hazard associated with the service.
A permit is not required when fixture isolation is achieved with the utilization of a nontestable
backflow preventer.
§ 263-11. Existing in-use backflow prevention devices.
Any existing backflow preventer shall be allowed by the Department to continue in service unless the
degree of hazard is such as to supersede the effectiveness of the present backflow preventer or will
result in an unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has increased, as in
the case of a residential installation converting to a business establishment, any existing backflow
preventer must be upgraded to a reduced pressure principle device or a reduced pressure principle
device must be installed in the event that no backflow device was present.
§ 263-12. Periodic testing.
Reduced pressure principle backflow devices shall be tested and inspected at least semiannually.
Periodic testing shall be performed by the Department's certified tester or his delegated
representative. This testing will be done at the owner's expense.
The testing shall be conducted during the Department's regular business hours. Exceptions to
this, when at the request of the owner, may require additional charges to cover the increased
costs to the Department.
Any backflow preventer which fails during a periodic test will be repaired or replaced. When
repairs are necessary, upon completion of the repair, the device will be retested at owners
expense to insure correct operation. High-hazard situations will not be allowed to continue
unprotected if the backflow preventer fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
situations, a compliance date of not more than thirty (30) days after the test date will be
established. The owner is responsible for spare parts, repair tools or a replacement device.
Parallel installation of two (2) devices is an effective means of the owner ensuring that
uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and is strongly recommended when
the owner desires such continuity.
Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than specified in Subsection A above,
in cases where there is a history of test failures and the Department feels that due to the degree of
hazard involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional tests will be born by the
owner.
§ 263-13. Records and reports.
Records. The Department will initiate and maintain the following:
Master files on customer cross-connection tests and/or inspections.
Master files on cross-connection permits.
Copies of permits and permit applications.
Copies of lists and summaries.

§ 274-1. Purpose and legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the City of Oswego's authority concerning the
placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications facilities. The City of
Oswego finds that wireless telecommunications facilities may pose significant concerns to the
health, safety, public welfare, character and environment of the City and its inhabitants.
The Common Council further finds that facilitating the development of wireless service technology
can be an economic development asset to the City and of significant benefit to the City and its
residents. In order to insure that the placement, construction or modification of wireless
telecommunications facilities is consistent with the City's land use policies, the City is adopting a
single, comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and permit process. The
intent of this chapter is to minimize the negative impact of wireless telecommunications facilities,
establish a fair and efficient process for review and approval of applications, assure an integrated,
comprehensive review of environmental impacts of such facilities, and protect the health, safety
and welfare of the City of Oswego.

application thereof to any person or circumstance is declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid for
any reason, then such word, phrase, sentence, part, section, subsection, or other portion, or the
proscribed application thereof, shall be severable, and the remaining provisions of this chapter,
and all applications thereof, not having been declared void, unconstitutional, or invalid, shall
remain in full force and effect.
Any special use permit issued under this chapter shall be comprehensive and not severable. If
part of a permit is deemed or ruled to be invalid or unenforceable in any material respect, by a
competent authority, or is overturned by a competent authority, the permit shall be void in total,
upon determination by the City.
§ 274-3. Definitions.

Both the wireless telecommunications facility and any and all accessory or associated facilities
shall maximize the use of building materials, colors and textures designed to blend with the
structure to which it may be affixed and/or to harmonize with the natural surroundings; this shall
include the utilization of stealth or concealment technology as may required by the City.
At a telecommunications site, an access road, turnaround space and parking shall be provided to
assure adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use of existing roads, whether public
or private, shall be made to the extent practicable. Road construction shall at all times minimize
ground disturbance and the cutting of vegetation. Road grades shall closely follow natural
contours to assure minimal visual disturbance and reduce soil erosion.
All wireless telecommunications facilities shall be constructed, operated, maintained, repaired,
provided for removal of, modified or restored in strict compliance with all current applicable
technical, safety and safety-related codes adopted by the City, State, or United States, including
but not limited to the most recent editions of the ANSI Code, National Electrical Safety Code, New
York State Fire Protection Code and the National Electrical Code, as well as accepted and
responsible workmanlike industry practices and recommended practices of the National
Association of Tower Erectors. The codes referred to are codes that include, but are not limited to,
construction, building, electrical, fire, safety, health, and land use codes. In the event of a conflict
between or among any of the preceding the more stringent shall apply.
A holder of a special use permit granted under this chapter shall obtain, at its own expense, all
permits and licenses required by applicable law, rule, regulation or code, and must maintain the
same, in full force and effect, for as long as required by the City or other governmental entity or
agency having jurisdiction over the applicant.
An applicant shall submit to the City the number of completed applications determined to be
needed at the preapplication meeting. Written notification of the application shall be provided to
the legislative body of all adjacent municipalities.

Allow shared use of the new tower if another telecommunications provider agrees in writing to
pay reasonable charges. The charges may include, but are not limited to, a pro rata share of
the cost of site selection, planning, project administration, land costs, site design, construction
and maintenance financing, return on equity, less depreciation, and all of the costs of
adapting the tower or equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
Failure to abide by the conditions outlined above may be grounds for revocation of the special
use permit for the tower.
There shall be a preapplication meeting. The purpose of the preapplication meeting will be to
address issues that will help to expedite the review and permitting process. A preapplication
meeting shall also include a site visit if there has not been a prior site visit for the requested site.
Costs of the City's consultants to prepare for and attend the preapplication meeting will be borne
by the applicant.
The holder of a special use permit shall notify the City of any intended modification of a wireless
telecommunications facility and shall apply to the City to modify, relocate or rebuild a wireless
telecommunications facility.
In order to better inform the public, in the case of a new telecommunications tower, the applicant
shall, prior to the public hearing on the application, hold a "balloon test." The applicant shall
arrange to fly, or raise upon a temporary mast, a minimum of a three foot in diameter brightly
colored balloon at the maximum height of the proposed new tower. The dates (including a second
date, in case of poor visibility on the initial date), times and location of this balloon test shall be
advertised by the applicant seven and 14 days in advance of the first test date in a newspaper
with a general circulation in the City. The applicant shall inform the City, in writing, of the dates and
times of the test, at least 14 days in advance. The balloon shall be flown for at least four
consecutive hours sometime between 7:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. on the dates chosen. The primary
date shall be on a weekend, but in case of poor weather on the initial date, the secondary date
may be on a weekday.
The applicant will provide a written copy of an analysis, completed by a qualified individual or
organization, to determine if the tower or existing structure intended to support wireless facilities
requires lighting under Federal Aviation Administration Regulation Part 77. This requirement shall
be for any new tower or for an existing structure or building where the application increases the
height of the structure or building. If this analysis determines, that the FAA must be contacted,
then all filings with the FAA, all responses from the FAA and any related correspondence shall be
provided in a timely manner.
§ 274-6. Location of wireless telecommunications facilities.
Applicants for wireless telecommunications facilities shall locate, site and erect said wireless
telecommunications facilities in accordance with the following priorities, (1) being the highest
priority and (4) being the lowest priority:
[Amended 9-27-2004by Res. No. 385-2004]
On existing towers or other structures without increasing the height of the tower or structure;
On City-owned properties;
On properties in areas zoned for industrial use;
On properties in areas zoned for commercial use;
If the proposed site is not proposed for the highest priority listed above, then a detailed
explanation must be provided as to why a site of a higher priority was not selected. The person

seeking such an exception must satisfactorily demonstrate the reason or reasons why such a
permit should be granted for the proposed site, and the hardship that would be incurred by the
applicant if the permit were not granted for the proposed site.
An applicant may not bypass sites of higher priority by stating the site proposed is the only site
leased or selected. An application shall address collocation as an option. If such option is not
proposed, the applicant must explain to the reasonable satisfaction of the City why collocation is
commercially or otherwise impracticable. Agreements between providers limiting or prohibiting
collocation shall not be a valid basis for any claim of commercial impracticability or hardship.
Notwithstanding the above, the City may approve any site located within an area in the above list
of priorities, provided that the City finds that the proposed site is in the best interest of the health,
safety and welfare of the City and its inhabitants and will not have a deleterious effect on the
nature and character of the community and neighborhood.
The applicant shall submit a written report demonstrating the applicant's review of the above
locations in order of priority, demonstrating the technological reason for the site selection. If
appropriate, based on selecting a site of lower priority, a detailed written explanation as to why
sites of a higher priority were not selected shall be included with the application.
Notwithstanding that a potential site may be situated in an area of highest priority or highest
available priority, the City may disapprove an application for any of the following reasons:
Conflict with safety and safety-related codes and/or requirements;
Conflict with the historic nature or character of a neighborhood or historical district;
The use or construction of wireless telecommunications facilities which is contrary to an
already stated purpose of a specific zoning or land use designation;
The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities which would create an
unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such, to residents, the public, employees
and agents of the City, or employees of the service provider or other service providers;
The placement and location of wireless telecommunications facilities which would create an
unacceptable risk, or the reasonable probability of such, to commercial property;
Conflicts with the provisions of this chapter.
§ 274-7. Shared use of wireless telecommunications facilities and
other structures.
The City, as opposed to the construction of a new tower, shall prefer locating on existing towers or
others structures without increasing the height. The applicant shall submit a comprehensive report
inventorying existing towers and other suitable structures within four miles of the location of any
proposed new tower, unless the applicant can show that some other distance is more reasonable
and demonstrate conclusively why an existing tower or other suitable structure cannot be used.
An applicant intending to locate on an existing tower or other suitable structure shall be required to
document the intent of the existing owner to permit its use by the applicant.
Such shared use shall consist only of the minimum antenna array technologically required to
provide service primarily and essentially within the City, to the extent practicable, unless good
cause is shown.

§ 274-13. Retention of expert assistance and reimbursement by
applicant.
The City may hire any consultant and/or expert necessary to assist the City in reviewing and
evaluating the application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted,
and any requests for recertification.
An applicant shall deposit with the City funds sufficient to reimburse the City for all reasonable
costs of consultant and expert evaluation and consultation to the City in connection with the review
of any application, including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. The
initial deposit shall be $8,500. The placement of the $8,500 with the City shall precede the
preapplication meeting. The City will maintain a separate escrow account for all such funds. The
City's consultants/experts shall invoice the City for their services in reviewing the application,
including the construction and modification of the site, once permitted. If at any time during the
process this escrow account has a balance less than $2,500, the applicant shall immediately,
upon notification by the City, replenish said escrow account so that it has a balance of at least
$5,000. Such additional escrow funds shall be deposited with the City before any further action or
consideration is taken on the application. In the event that the amount held in escrow by the City is
more than the amount of the actual invoicing at the conclusion of the project, the remaining
balance shall be promptly refunded to the applicant.
The total amount of the funds needed as set forth in Subsection B of this section may vary with
the scope and complexity of the project, the completeness of the application and other information
as may be needed to complete the necessary review, analysis and inspection of any construction
or modification.
§ 274-14. Exceptions from special use permit requirement.
No person shall be permitted to site, place, build, construct, modify or prepare any site for the
placement or use of wireless telecommunications facilities as of the effective date of this chapter
without having first obtained a special use permit for wireless telecommunications facilities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this section, no special use permit shall be required for
those noncommercial exceptions noted in the definition of "wireless telecommunications facilities."
All wireless telecommunications facilities existing on or before the effective date of this chapter
shall be allowed to continue as they presently exist; provided, however, that any visible
modification of an existing wireless telecommunications facility must comply with this chapter.
§ 274-15. Public hearing and notification requirements.
Prior to the approval of any application for a special use permit for wireless telecommunications
facilities, a public hearing shall be held by the City, notice of which shall be published in the official
newspaper of the City no less than 10 calendar days prior to the scheduled date of the public
hearing. In order that the City may notify nearby landowners, the application shall contain the
names and address of all landowners whose property is located within 1,500 feet of any property
line of the lot or parcel on which the new wireless telecommunications facilities are proposed to be

conformance with the city's waterfront revitalization program.
The Planning Board may require changes or additions in relation to yards, driveways, entrances
and exits, landscaping and location and height of buildings and enclosures to ensure safety, to
minimize traffic difficulties and to safeguard adjacent properties. Should changes or additional
facilities be required by the Board, final approval of the site plan shall be conditional upon the
satisfactory compliance by the owner with changes or additions. Any owner wishing to make
changes in an approved site plan shall submit a revised site plan to the Planning Board for review
and approval.

five days prior to said hearing. Notice of said hearing shall also be given to the owners of all
adjoining properties.
Prior to making any determination, the Planning Board will cause a review of the proposal
pursuant to the requirements of the State Environmental Quality Review Act (SEQRA).
Within 60 days of the close of the public hearing, the Planning Board shall render a decision on
the site plan application.
The Planning Board shall act by resolution to approve, approve with modifications or disapprove
the site plan application. A resolution either approving or approving with modifications shall include
the authorization for the Planning Board Chairman to stamp and sign the site plan upon the
applicant's compliance with the submitted site plan. Any modifications required by the Planning
Board shall be deemed a condition of approval. If the site plan has been disapproved, the
Planning Board's resolution shall state the reasons for such decision.
Reasonable costs incurred by the Planning Board for private consultation fees of a planner,
engineer or attorney or other expense in connection with the review of a proposed site plan shall
be charged to the applicant. In this regard, the Planning Board may require such costs to be paid
in advance and may deny an application upon failure of the applicant to make payment within 60
days of the date of the original application submission.
§ 280-38. Performance bond.
The Planning Board may require as a condition of site plan approval that the owner file a performance

Article VIII. Signs
§ 280-45. Objectives and applicability.
This article regulates signs within the City of Oswego that are visible from the right-of-way and
from beyond the property where erected. These regulations balance the need to protect the public
safety and welfare, the need for a well-maintained and attractive community and the need for
adequate identification, communication and advertising for all land uses. The regulations for signs
have the following objectives:
To ensure that signs are designed, constructed, installed and maintained so that public safety
and traffic safety are not compromised.
To allow and promote positive conditions for meeting a sign user's needs, while at the same
time avoiding nuisances to nearby properties and promoting an attractive environment.
To reflect and support the desired character and development patterns of the various districts
and conform to applicable design standards.
To allow for adequate and effective signs in commercial and industrial districts while
preventing signs from dominating the visual appearance of the area.
These regulations allow for adequate and multiple types of signs for a site. The provisions do not
necessarily assure or provide for a property owner's desired level of visibility for the signs.
Unless specified otherwise, the regulations in this article apply to districts not covered by the
Design Standards.

Purpose. It is the purpose of this section to regulate the placement, construction and installation of
wind-energy-producing systems while promoting the safe, effective and efficient use of such
systems. These regulations relate to siting of wind-energy-producing systems in the City of
Oswego and do not address large-scale wind farms which are typically intended to sell energy
directly to power companies or retail users.
Findings. The City of Oswego finds and declares that wind energy is an abundant, renewable and
nonpolluting energy resource of the City and that its conversion to electricity will reduce the City's
dependence on nonrenewable energy sources and decrease the air and water pollution that
results from the use of conventional energy sources.
The City of Oswego further finds and declares that regulation of siting and installation of wind
turbines is necessary for the purpose of protecting the health and safety of neighboring property
owners and the general public and for preserving the aesthetics of the community.
Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
EMERGENCY PROCEDURES PLAN
A document filed with the Oswego Code Enforcement Office detailing the procedures to shut
down a wind energy system in case of emergency.
SYSTEM HEIGHT
With regard to a wind energy system, the combination tower height plus blade length.
TOWER
With regard to a wind energy system, the structure on which the wind turbine is mounted.
TOWER HEIGHT
With regard to a wind energy system, the height above grade of the fixed portion of the tower.
TURBINE
The parts of a wind energy system, including the blades, generator and tail.
WIND ENERGY SYSTEMS
A wind energy conversion system consisting of a wind turbine, tower and associated control
or conversion electronics which has a rated capacity of no more than 25 kW for residential
use and no more than 125 kW for business zones and is not for resale to any other individual
and/or commercial entity, and not more than 1.5 MW systems for industrial zones.
Site plan review. The following submission guidelines shall be required for Planning Board
applications:
Wind system design.
Tower: The tower shall be either steel lattice or solid tube monotower and designed to
handle the maximum potential load as certified by a New York State licensed engineer. In
addition, under no circumstances shall the height of the system exceed the height
specified by the manufacturer of the system.
Minimum blade height: The minimum distance between the ground and the turbine
blades must be 25 feet, measured at the lowest point of the blade arc.
Color: The tower shall maintain a neutral, nonreflective exterior color that blends with the
surrounding environment.
Advertising: No wind tower, turbine, building or other structure associated with a wind
energy system may be used to advertise or promote any product or service. A weatherresistant
sign on the exterior of the tower, no greater than two square feet in size, shall
include the name and address of the current owner, twenty-four-hour emergency phone

required or permitted, under this section, to be devoted to landscaping, water features and
environmental improvement, which may include existing and new vegetation, berms, lighting, site and

Along any district boundary where a nonresidential district abuts a residential district, there shall
be provided within the nonresidential district a landscaped area at least 20 feet wide, which shall
be suitably landscaped and maintained to provide visual screening from adjacent residential
properties.
Where any nonresidential land use in a residential district abuts any residential land use, there
shall be provided by the nonresidential use a landscaped area at least 15 feet wide, which shall be
suitably landscaped and maintained to provide visual screening from adjacent residential
properties.
In any Planned Unit Development District, landscaping shall be provided as required by the
Planning Board.
Specifications.
Required landscaping shall consist of shade trees, deciduous shrubs, evergreens, well-kept
grassed areas and ground cover.
One shade tree at least eight feet in height and at least two inches in diameter measured at a
point six inches above finished grade level shall be planted no nearer than five feet to any lot
line for each 500 square feet of required landscaped area; and one deciduous shrub or
evergreen shall be planted for every 200 square feet of required landscaped area.
All such landscaping shall be maintained in a healthy growing condition with ground cover or
grassed areas. Dead material shall be replaced, and plant material shall be regularly pruned
and nourished to maintain health.
The Planning Board may require fencing or suitable landscaping to provide adequate
screening of property. Such fencing shall be erected so that the finished or smooth side faces
the public.
In nonresidential areas, erosion control plans shall be incorporated into all landscape plans.
Bufferyards.
In addition to standard setbacks and the planting requirements outlined in this section,
additional bufferyards shall be used to establish a greater separation where dissimilar land
uses are located adjacent to each other. Careful site planning can minimize the need for
constructed bufferyards by the preservation of natural topographic features, preservation of
vegetation and sensitive location of site improvements and land uses.
The type and extent of plantings, fencing and walls required for bufferyards shall be
proportionally greater for increased degrees of incompatibility among adjacent land uses.
§ 280-78. Fences, hedges and walls.
In residential districts, fences, hedges and walls not exceeding a height of four feet in a front yard
or six feet in a side or rear yard shall be permitted. Fences, hedges and walls up to eight feet in
height may be permitted by the Board of Appeals anywhere on a lot when it finds that:
They will contribute to the aesthetic appearance of the neighborhood and are an integral part
of the premises.
They will not adversely affect the access of adjoining lots to light and air.
In nonresidential districts adjoining residential districts, fences, hedges and walls shall not exceed
eight feet in height along the boundary; elsewhere there shall be no restriction on the height of

§ 280-81. Adult uses.
Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to regulate sexually oriented businesses in order to
promote the health, safety, morals and general welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of
this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the
content of any speech, including sexually oriented speech. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of
this chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to speech protected by the First Amendment and
New York Constitution, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented
speech to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this chapter to condone or
legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
Findings. The Mayor and members of the City Council of the City of Oswego are all residents of
the city and represent one of the seven wards in the city or the city-at-large. The Mayor and
members of the Council are familiar with the city and the issues raised by sexually oriented
businesses in the city and throughout the country. The Mayor and Council are also cognizant that
AIDS, hepatitis and other sexually transmitted diseases are serious health concerns in the local
community. Based on the Mayor and Council's local knowledge and evidence concerning the
impacts or secondary effects of adult uses on the community, as presented in reports made
available to the Council, on findings involving the effects of sexually oriented businesses and
public nudity incorporated in judicial decisions such as, but not limited to, Town of Islip v. Caviglia,
73 N.Y.2d 544 (1989); Stringfellow's of New York, Ltd. v. City of New York, 91 N.Y.2d 382 (1998);
City of Erie v. Pap's A.M., 146 L. Ed.2d 265 (2000); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475
U.S. 41(1986); U.S.v. O'Brien, 88 S.Ct. 163 (1968); Steam Heat vs. Silva, 230 A.D.2d 800 (2nd
Dept. 1996); and Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991); and on studies in other
communities, including, but not limited to: Kansas City, Missouri (April 1998); Whittier, California
(July 1994); Denver, Colorado (January 1998); and Newport News, Virginia (March 1996), and
from publications such as the New York Planning Federation article "Everything You Ever Wanted
to Know About Adult Entertainment Regulations," and the Adult Use Manual of Massachusetts
Chapter APA & City Solicitor & Town Counsel Association; the Mayor and Council find:

C.
Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and unhealthy activities
that are not properly controlled by the operators of the establishments. Further, there are not
adequate legal provisions making the owners of these establishments responsible for the
activities that occur on their premises.
Employees of sexually oriented businesses engage in or may be requested to engage in
sexual behavior as a result of the type of employment in which they are engaged.
Sexual acts, including masturbation, occur at sexually oriented businesses, especially those
which provide private or semi-private booths or cubicles for viewing films, videos or live sex
shows.
The "entertainment" offered at sexually oriented businesses often encourages sexual
activities, which create unhealthy conditions.
Persons frequently visit sexually oriented businesses for the purpose of engaging in sexual
activities within the premises of such sexually oriented businesses.
Communicable diseases may be spread by sexual activities, including, but not limited to,
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), AIDS, hepatitis B, and venereal diseases.
AIDS, HIV, hepatitis B and venereal diseases are serious health concerns in the local
community.
Sanitary conditions in some sexually oriented businesses are unhealthy, in part, because the
activities conducted there are unhealthy, and, in part, because of the unregulated nature of
the activities and the failure of the owners and the operators of the facilities to regulate those
activities and maintain those facilities.
Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in certain areas of
sexually oriented businesses, particularly where persons view adult-oriented films or adult
entertainment.
The Council further determines that sexual encounter centers, as defined herein, do not serve
a legitimate purpose, offer a location at which sexual activities and acts of prostitution can
readily occur, and provide a location at which sexually transmitted diseases may be spread.
The Council thus determines that sexual encounter centers should be prohibited.
The Council further determines that adult hotels or motels, as defined herein, offer a location
at which sexual activities and acts of prostitution can readily occur due to the offering of shortterm
or hourly rooms with beds, and provide a location at which sexually transmitted diseases
may be spread. The Council thus determines that adult hotels or motels should be prohibited.
The general welfare, health, morals and safety of the citizens of the city will be promoted by
the enactment of this chapter.
Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated
hereinafter; the definitions contained within § 280-11 of this chapter shall also apply.
ESTABLISHMENT
Includes any of the following:
The opening or commencement of any sexually oriented business as a new business.
The conversion of an existing business, whether or not a sexually oriented business, to
any sexually oriented business.

containing another adult use.
For the purpose of this article, measurement shall be made in a straight line, without regard to
intervening structures or objects, from the nearest portion of the building or structure used as
part of the premises where an adult use is conducted to the nearest property line of the
premises of a church or public or private elementary or secondary school, or to the nearest

such nonconforming use shall immediately thereafter and henceforth be eligible for or
occupied by only conforming uses.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection C(1), if a prior nonconforming use has ceased
its nonconforming use for one year or more, the owner may apply to the Zoning Board of
Appeals for a special permit to use the building, structure or lot for the purpose that it was
originally constructed.
In making its decision, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall consider the following criteria:
Whether the owner can establish the original constructed use of the building or structure
to justify reinstatement of the nonconforming use.
Whether the owner has adequate parking on the property available to meet the
requirements of § 280-39 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Whether the proposed use of the building, structure or lot is in harmony with the
neighborhood and will not adversely increase the population and vehicular density of the
neighborhood.

Whether the proposed use of the building, structure or lot is the most economically viable
alternative to reestablish the original use of the property.
Whether it is necessary that the special permit be granted with conditions.
Change to another nonconforming use. A nonconforming use may be changed to another
nonconforming use by special permit from the Board of Appeals, if the said Board deems the
proposed nonconforming use to be sufficiently similar in nature to the existing nonconforming use
and closer in character to surrounding conforming uses than is the existing nonconforming use.
Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or extended or relocated to a different
position on the lot which it occupies.
Any nonconforming use, as hereinbefore or hereinafter referred to, is an affirmative defense in any
action or proceeding.
In an Industrial District included in an Economic Development Zone (EDZ), an existing
nonconforming residential use may be continued with respect to the same number of existing onefamily
dwellings situate on the premises; however, the size of the one-family dwellings and
accessory uses shall not be subject to the requirements of Subsection E of this section.
§ 280-83. Damaged nonconforming uses.
If a nonconforming use and a building or other structure of nonconforming bulk sustains an amount of
damage or destruction by any cause, which amount is officially appraised to be 75% or more of its true
value, the building, other structure or tract of land shall thereafter be eligible for and occupied by only a
conforming use, and the damaged portions of the building or other structure shall, if rebuilt or
reconstructed, conform to pertinent use and bulk regulations for that district.
§ 280-84. Maintenance, repair and alteration of nonconforming
uses.
Maintenance and repairs. Customary maintenance of a building or other structure containing a
nonconforming use is permitted, including necessary nonstructural repairs and minor alterations,
so long as they do not increase or expand the nonconforming use.
Structural alterations. No structural alterations are permitted, except when required by law or when
adapting or remodeling a building or other structure for a conforming use.
§ 280-85. Buildings nonconforming in bulk.
Changes or alterations. Buildings and structures which are only nonconforming in bulk may be
altered, moved, reconstructed or enlarged, provided that each change does not increase the
degree of, or create any new, nonconforming bulk in such building and does not violate any other
provisions of this chapter.
Reduction in lot area. No lot shall be reduced in area so that it creates a nonconforming bulk or
use in violation of any regulations contained in this chapter.
§ 280-86. Existing undersized lots.

local law, to grant area variances as defined herein.
In making its determination, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall take into consideration the
benefit to the applicant if the variance is granted, as weighed against the detriment to the
health, safety and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant. In making such
determination the Board shall also consider:
Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the character of the neighborhood or
a detriment to nearby properties will be created by the granting of the area variance;
Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be achieved by some method feasible
for the applicant to pursue, other than an area variance;
Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect or impact on the physical or
environmental conditions in the neighborhood or district; and
Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which consideration shall be relevant to
the decision of the Board of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting of
the area variance.
The Board of Appeals, in the granting of area variances, shall grant the minimum variance
that it shall deem necessary and adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and welfare of the community.
Use variances.
The Board of Appeals, on referral from the Zoning Administrator or on application by any
person allegedly aggrieved by the strict application of any of the requirements of this chapter
or desiring to deviate therefrom, shall have the power to grant use variances, as set forth
herein. Application for variance shall be made to the Zoning Administrator in such form as
he/she may prescribe.
Referral to Planning Board. At least 45 days before the date of public hearing held in
connection with any application for a use variance submitted, the Board of Appeals shall
transmit to the Planning Board a copy of said application, and shall request that the
Planning Board submit to the Board of Appeals its advisory opinion on said application.
The Planning Board shall submit a report of such advisory opinion prior to the date of
said public hearing. The failure of the Planning Board to submit such report shall be
interpreted as a favorable opinion for the granting of the use variance applied for.
No such use variance shall be granted by the Board of Appeals without the applicant showing
that applicable zoning regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary hardship. In
order to prove such unnecessary hardship the applicant shall demonstrate to the Board of
Appeals that for each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for the particular
district where the property is located:
The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided that lack of return is
substantial as demonstrated by competent financial evidence;
The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is unique and does not apply to
a substantial portion of the district or neighborhood;
The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood; and
The alleged hardship has not been self-created.

Board of Appeals its advisory opinion on said application. The Planning Board shall submit a

special permit applied for.

time limit for specified use approved by the special permit. Transfer of use to a new owner shall
require the same conditions and requirements as specified in the granted special permit. Any
