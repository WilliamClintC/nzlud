ARTICLE I
Procedures for Changing Terms of Office for Elected Public Officials
[Adopted 1-24-2000 by L.L. No. 2-2000]
§ 54-1. Legislative findings.
This Board has determined that the New York State Law with reference to
changing the terms of office of local officials is totally inadequate. Based
on the current state law, future Boards of Trustees can change the term
of office with a simple resolution and with very little opportunity for public
input. This Board believes the state law does not protect the public
inasmuch as it does not require a public hearing on the question of changing
terms of office and it does not allow time for a fair, open and very public
dialogue. Without these two components, the public is effectively removed
from the process. This article sets forth a series of events which will ensure
that the public is aware, early in the political process, that its elective
officials are attempting to change their terms of office, and this will allow
sufficient time and opportunity for the public to be actively involved in the
decisionmaking process.
§ 54-2. Legislative intent.
It is the specific legislative intent of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa
Park enacting this article to protect, preserve and ensure the integrity
and continuation of the annual elections in the Incorporated Village of
Massapequa Park.
§ 54-3. Written petition for public hearing required.
In order to change the term of office for any elected public official or
officials, there must be a written petition signed by a minimum of 250
registered voters in the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park
requesting a public hearing to be held to change the term of office for said
elected public official or officials, which written petition must be submitted
to the Village Administrator at Village Hall.
§ 54-4. Petition and notification procedures for public hearing.
A. Scheduling of public hearing. After receipt of this written petition,
within 60 days thereafter, this matter shall be placed on the agenda at a
Board of Trustees' meeting for a vote scheduling thereafter a public
hearing, which vote must be approved by a majority of the entire Board
of Trustees, If the vote to hold the public hearing is not approved by a
majority of the entire Board of Trustees, then the issue to change the
term of office for an elected public official or officials is deemed
defeated for all purposes.
B. Conditions for renewal of petition. This same issue cannot be
considered again by the Board of Trustees until such time as there is a
new written petition submitted to the Village Administrator of the
§ 54-1 TERMS OF OFFICE § 54-4
54:25
§ 54-5. Number of votes required for placement of proposition on
ballot.
After a full public hearing has been held concerning this issue relating to
changing the term of office for an elected public official or officials, the
decision to place a proposition to change the said term of office on the
public ballot by permissive referendum or otherwise on the public ballot
must be approved in the affirmative by a vote of at least four members of the
Board of Trustees. If the vote relating to changing the term of office for an
elected public official or officials is not approved by at least four members
of the Board of Trustees, then the issue to change the term of office for
an elected public official or officials is deemed defeated for all purposes
and shall only be submitted at least one year after the initial date that the
Board of Trustees voted not to change the term of office for an elected
public official or officials on the public ballot by permissive referendum or
otherwise.
§ 54-6. Time limitations for placement of proposition on ballot.
The proposition to change the term of office for an elected public official or
officials shall only be put on the ballot no less than nine months prior to the
next mayoral election, and the proposition can only appear on the ballot by
permissive referendum or otherwise during the mayoral election year.
§ 54-7. Approval by majority of votes required.
Once this proposition has been placed on the public ballot by permissive
referendum or otherwise, the proposition must be approved by a majority
of the votes cast by registered voters in the Incorporated Village of
Massapequa Park.
Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park, and the said new written
petition, signed by a minimum of 250 registered voters in the
Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park, shall only be submitted at
least one year after the initial date that the Board of Trustees voted
not to hold a public hearing to change the term of office for an elected
public official or officials.
C. Public hearing requirements. If the Board of Trustees votes by the
majority of the entire Board to hold a scheduled public hearing, there
must be a minimum of 90 days' notice of the said scheduled public
hearing, and notice of the scheduled public hearing must be posted in
both of the local newspapers in the Village of Massapequa Park for four
consecutive weeks prior to the scheduled public hearing, and notice of
said scheduled public hearing must also be posted in three conspicuous
areas in the Village of Massapequa Park for four weeks prior to the said
scheduled public hearing.

Establishments for On-Premises Consumption
[Adopted at time of adoption of Code8]
§ 70-5. Legislative findings.
A. The municipality of Massapequa Park, pursuant to its zoning powers,
may properly restrict the number of places used for the sale of alcoholic
beverages for on-premises consumption.
B. A local law prohibiting the use of or the sale of alcoholic beverages
within a particular zone of a building or premises directly devoted to a
similar use is a valid exercise of the zoning powers.
C. The regulation and control of the location of establishments making
alcoholic beverages available for on-premises consumption shall foster
and permit temperance in the consumption of alcohol and respect for
obedience of the law.
D. The use of property for the sale of liquor is construed and deemed by
legislative authority to have a more deleterious effect upon the health
and welfare of the community than ordinary business.
E. A municipality may restrict the number of places where liquor or other
alcoholic beverages are made available for on-premises consumption
within a particular geographical area, and this restriction may differ
substantially from a similar restriction relating to other permitted uses
for property.
F. The power of the state or any subordinate division thereof, including
the municipality of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park, is
hereby authorized to act ill the matter to regulate and restrict the use of
property for the business of the sale of liquor, which power is broader
than the power to regulate or restrict property used for ordinary lawful
business.
G. The Village of Massapequa Park has many establishments licensed by
the New York State Liquor Authority for on-premises consumption of
alcoholic beverages. Many problems have been created by the
multitude of such establishments, which has adversely affected the
enjoyment of residential property in areas adjacent to such
establishments.
H. The existence and location of establishments serving alcoholic
beverages within the community has contributed to increased incidents
of vandalism and the destruction of private and public property, which
has imposed significantly difficult problems to the village and its
population in terms of law enforcement.
8. Editor's Note: See Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I.
§ 70-5 ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES § 70-5
70:31
§ 70-6. Definitions.
I. The existence and location of establishments serving alcoholic
beverages for on-premises consumption within the community has had
a detrimental ecological and environmental impact with the imposition
of additional burdens to the village in such matters as parking, littering
and noise control, as well as other conditions which have all had an
adverse impact on the quality of life.
J. The existence and location of establishments serving alcoholic
beverages for on-premises consumption within the community has
contributed to the unauthorized use and improper operation of motor
vehicles and loitering and numerous other activities, all of which
constitute public and private nuisances and undesirable conditions for
the population of the village, which justifies the enactment of this
article.
K. The enactment of this article will not adversely affect any premises
occupied by an existing business at its present location licensed by the
New York State Liquor Authority for on-premises consumption of
alcoholic beverages, but only restrict buildings from being occupied by
similar establishments within a two-hundred-foot radius from any other
building so occupied. This will result in substantial savings to the
residents of the Village of Massapequa Park in terms of police and fire
protection and vandalism deterrence and will prevent court congestion.
L. This article is a valid exercise of the zoning power of this village and, as
such, does not constitute an invasion of the power of the New York
State Liquor Authority.
A. Whenever used in this article, unless the context requires otherwise,
the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:
ALCOHOL  Ethyl alcohol, hydrated oxide of ethyl or spirit or wine
from whatever source or by whatever processes produced.

reserves to itself the power to modify specific requirements of this article
or any provisions of the village local laws and ordinances to promote the
health, welfare and safety of its residents.

to keep with the intent to sell.
B. All other language relating to alcoholic beverages shall be as defined by
the definitions in § 3 of Article 1 of the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law
of the State of New York, and all other nonalcoholic words shall be

licenses to enable any building to become occupied as an establishment
for the purpose of serving alcoholic beverages for on-premises
consumption if said building is located within a two-hundred-foot radius
of any other building which is also occupied as an establishment serving
alcoholic beverages for on-premises consumption.
B. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to prevent the sale, transfer
or other disposition of any business licensed by the State Liquor
Authority and the Village of Massapequa Park occupying a premises on
the effective date of this article.

statements of said building or structure have been submitted or approved.
§ 154-16. Demolition.
§ 154-17. Expiration for nonuse; cancellation processing fee.

this chapter, no money shall be refunded from said bond. If proposed
construction is abandoned, the village shall refund the deposit or cancel
the bond if the applicant restores the property to its original condition

building permit will carry a one-time three-month extension. Failure to
comply with this provision will result in a summons. For building
permits issued prior to the effective date of this subsection, a threemonth
grace period will be permitted, at the end of which time a threemonth
extension will be granted provided an application for renewal is
filed with a fee of $250. Failure to comply with this provision will result

C. A surety bond, in form and amount to be determined by the Building
Inspector, shall be filed with each application for a permit to demolish.
The bond shall be in sufficient amount to defray the expense of
completing the demolition to one foot below the grade of surrounding
ground level and the removal of demolished buildings, walls or other

the proposed demolition and all related work required by the Building
Inspector is completed. In the event that the demolition and related
work is not completed within the time limit set forth in said permit, as it
may be extended pursuant to § 154-16B, the Board of Trustees may
cause so much of such demolition work to be completed as it deems
necessary and shall use the proceeds from the surety bond posted by
the applicant to defray the expenses thereof. If the proposed demolition
is abandoned and the applicant restores the property and the remaining
buildings, walls and other structures thereon to the satisfaction of the

of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO, AH or VO Zone on
a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with a one-percent or
greater annual chance of flooding to an average annual depth of one foot to
three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path
of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  The land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in any
given year. This area may be designated as Zone A, AE, AH, AO, A1-A30,
A99, V, VO, VE or V1-V30. It is also commonly referred to as the base
floodplain or one-hundred-year floodplain. For purposes of this chapter, the
term "special flood hazard area (SFHA)" is synonymous in meaning with the
phrase "area of special flood hazard."
BASE FLOOD  The flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
BASEMENT  That portion of a building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support of
the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse
under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated
portion of the building or the supporting foundation system.

CELLAR  The same meaning as "basement."
COASTAL HIGH HAZARD AREA  An area of special flood hazard
extending from offshore to the inland limit of a primary frontal dune along
an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave action
from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on a FIRM as Zone
V1-V30, VE, VO or V.
CRAWL SPACE  An enclosed area beneath the lowest elevated floor, 18
inches or more in height, which is used to service the underside of the
lowest elevated floor. The elevation of the floor of this enclosed area, which
may be of soil, gravel, concrete or other material, must be equal to or above
the lowest adjacent exterior grade. The enclosed crawl space area shall be
properly vented to allow for the equalization of hydrostatic forces which
would be experienced during periods of flooding.

have the bottom of the lowest horizontal structure member of the elevated
floor, elevated above the ground level by means of pilings, columns (posts
and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and adequately
anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during
a flood of up to the magnitude of the base flood. In the case of Zones
A1-A30, AE, A, A99, AO, AH, B, C, X or D, "elevated building" also includes

This chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special flood
hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding
or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of
the Village of Massapequa Park, any officer or employee thereof, or the
Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result
from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made
thereunder.

The applicant shall provide the following information as appropriate.
Additional information may be required on the permit application form.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 158-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to, plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures,
fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee of $500. In addition, the applicant
shall be responsible for reimbursing the Village of Massapequa Park for
any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of
this project. The local administrator may require a deposit of no more
than $500 to cover these additional costs.
A. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially improved
structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or Zone A if base
flood elevation data are available. Upon completion of the lowest floor,
the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the as-built
elevation, certified by a licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
B. The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the bottom of
the lowest structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and
columns) of any new or substantially improved structure to be located
in Zones V1-V30 or VE, or Zone V if base flood elevation data are
available. Upon completion of the lowest floor, the permittee shall
§ 158-10 FIREARMS § 158-12
150:123
submit to the local administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a
licensed professional engineer or surveyor.

conveyance than the original stream segment. The applicant must
submit any maps, computations or other material required by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to revise the
documents enumerated in § 158-6, when notified by the local
administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs assessed by FEMA
for this purpose. The applicant must also provide assurances that the
conveyance capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
G. A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required by
the local administrator, which shows whether proposed development to
be located in an area of special flood hazard may result in physical
damage to any other property.
H. In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from other
sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the permit
applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments
(including proposals for manufactured home and recreational vehicle
parks and subdivisions) that are greater than either 50 lots or five
acres.

applicable provisions of this chapter.
A. Permit application review. The local administrator shall conduct the
following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 158-12, Permit application requirements, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of Article V, Construction standards, and, in
particular, § 158-14B, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
Article V, Construction standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.
(1) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has designated
areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (these areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
§ 158-12 FIREARMS § 158-13
150:125
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 158-12G, as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses. The local administrator shall:
(1) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State Department
of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such
notification to the Regional Director, Region II, Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
(2) Determine that the permit holder has provided for maintenance
within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.
D. Construction stage.
(1) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) In Zones V1-V30 and VE, and also Zone V if base flood elevation
data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor of a new or
substantially improved structure, the permit holder shall submit to
the local administrator a certificate of elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, of the bottom of the lowest structural member of the
lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns). The certificate shall
be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a licensed land
surveyor or professional engineer and certified by same. For
manufactured homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate
of elevation upon placement of the structure on the site. An
elevation certificate must also be submitted for a recreational
vehicle if it remains on a site 180 consecutive days or longer
(unless it is fully licensed and ready for highway use).

(3) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction in order to monitor compliance
with permit conditions and enable said inspector to certify, if requested,
that the development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 158-8 of this chapter.
(2) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found noncompliant
with the provisions of this chapter and/or the conditions of the
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 158-8 of this chapter.
G. Certificate of compliance.

elevation data are available, new construction and substantial
improvements shall have the space below the lowest floor either
free from obstruction or constructed with nonsupporting
breakaway walls, open wood lattice work or insect screening
intended to collapse under wind and water loads without causing
collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated
portion of the building or supporting foundation system. The
enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be used only for parking
vehicles, building access or storage. Use of this space for human
habitation is expressly prohibited. The construction of stairs,
stairwells and elevator shafts are subject to the design
requirements for breakaway walls.
C. Utilities.
(1) New and replacement electrical equipment, heating, ventilating,
air conditioning, plumbing connections, and other service
equipment shall be located at or above the base flood elevation or
be designed to prevent water from entering and accumulating
within the components during a flood and to resist hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic loads and stresses. Electrical wiring and outlets,
switches, junction boxes and panels shall be elevated to or above
the base flood elevation unless they conform to the appropriate
provisions of the electrical part of the Building Code of New York
State or the Residential Code of New York State for location of such
items in wet locations;
(2) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system;
§ 158-15 FIREARMS § 158-15
150:131
§ 158-16. Residential structures (except coastal high hazard areas).
Elevation. The following standards apply to new and substantially improved
residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard, in addition
to the requirements in § 158-14B, Subdivision proposals, § 158-14C,
Encroachments, and § 158-15, Standards for all structures.
§ 158-17. Residential structures (coastal high hazard areas).
The following standards, in addition to the standards in § 158-14A, Coastal
high hazard areas, § 158-14B, Subdivision proposals, and § 158-15,
Standards for all structures, apply to new and substantially improved
residential structures located in areas of special flood hazard shown as
Zones V1-V30, VE or V on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
designated in § 158-6.
(3) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters. Sanitary sewer
and storm drainage systems for buildings that have openings below
the base flood elevation shall be provided with automatic backflow
valves or other automatic backflow devices that are installed in
each discharge line passing through a building's exterior wall; and
(4) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid
impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding.
A. Within Zones A1-A30, AE and AH and also Zone A if base flood elevation
data are available, new construction and substantial improvements
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above
two feet above the base flood elevation.
B. Within Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available, new
and substantially improved structures shall have the lowest floor
(including basement) elevated at least three feet above the highest
adjacent grade.
C. Within Zone AO, new and substantially improved structures shall have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the highest
adjacent grade at least as high as two feet above the depth number
specified in feet on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 158-6 (at least two feet if no depth number is
specified).
D. Within Zones AH and AO, adequate drainage paths are required to
guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures on
slopes.
A. Elevation. New construction and substantial improvements shall be
elevated on pilings, columns or shear walls such that the bottom of the
lowest horizontal structural member supporting the lowest elevated
floor (excluding columns, piles, diagonal bracing attached to the piles
or columns, grade beams, pile caps and other members designed to
§ 158-15 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 158-17
150:132
either withstand storm action or break away without imparting
damaging loads to the structure) is elevated to or above two feet above
base flood elevation so as not to impede the flow of water.
B. Determination of loading forces. Structural design shall consider the
effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously during the base
flood on all building components.
(1) The structural design shall be adequate to resist water forces that
would occur during the base flood. Horizontal water loads
considered shall include inertial and drag forces of waves, current
drag forces, and impact forces from waterborne storm debris.
Dynamic uplift loads shall also be considered if bulkheads, walls, or
other natural or man-made flow obstructions could cause wave
runup beyond the elevation of the base flood.
(2) Buildings shall be designed and constructed to resist the forces due
to wind pressure. Wind forces on the superstructure include
windward and leeward forces on vertical walls, uplift on the roof,
internal forces when openings allow wind to enter the house, and
upward force on the underside of the house when it is exposed. In
the design, the wind should be assumed to blow potentially from
any lateral direction relative to the house.
(3) Wind loading values used shall be those required by the building
code.
C. Foundation standards.
(1) The pilings or column foundation and structure attached thereto
shall be adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral
movement due to the effects of wind and water pressures acting
simultaneously on all building components. Foundations must be
designed to transfer safely to the underlying soil all loads due to
wind, water, dead load, live load and other loads (including uplift
due to wind and water).
(2) Spread footings and fill material shall not be used for structural
support of a new building or substantial improvement of an existing
structure.
D. Pile foundation design.
(1) The design ratio of pile spacing to pile diameter shall not be less
than 8:1 for individual piles (this shall not apply to pile clusters
located below the design grade). The maximum center-to-center
spacing of wood piles shall not be more than 12 feet on center
under load-bearing sills, beams, or girders.
(2) Pilings shall have adequate soil penetration (bearing capacity) to
resist the combined wave and wind loads (lateral and uplift)
associated with the base flood acting simultaneously with typical
§ 158-17 FIREARMS § 158-17
150:133
structure (live and dead) loads, and shall include consideration
of decreased resistance capacity caused by erosion of soil strata
surrounding the piles. The minimum penetration for foundation
piles is to an elevation of five feet below mean sea level (msl) datum
if the BFE is +10 msl or less, or to be at least 10 feet below msl if
the BFE is greater than +10 msl.
(3) Pile foundation analysis shall also include consideration of piles in
column action from the bottom of the structure to the stable soil
elevation of the site. Pilings may be horizontally or diagonally
braced to withstand wind and water forces.
(4) The minimum acceptable sizes for timber piles are a tip diameter of
eight inches for round timber piles and eight inches by eight inches
for square timber piles. All wood piles must be treated in
accordance with requirements of EPEE-C3 to minimize decay and
damage from fungus.
(5) Reinforced concrete piles shall be cast of concrete having a twentyeight-
day ultimate compressive strength of not less than 5,000
pounds per square inch, and shall be reinforced with a minimum of
four longitudinal steel bars having a combined area of not less than
1% nor more than 4% of the gross concrete area. Reinforcing for
precast piles shall have a concrete cover of not less than 1 1/4
inches for No. 5 bars and smaller and not less than 1 1/2 inches for
No. 6 through No. 11 bars. Reinforcement for piles cast in the field
shall have a concrete cover of not less than two inches.
(6) Piles shall be driven by means of a pile driver or drop hammer,
jetted or augered into place.
(7) Additional support for piles in the form of bracing may include
lateral or diagonal bracing between piles.
(8) When necessary, piles shall be braced at the ground line in both
directions by a wood timber-grade beam or a reinforced concretegrade
beam. These at-grade supports should be securely attached
to the piles to provide support even if scoured from beneath.
(9) Diagonal bracing between piles, consisting of two-inch-by-eightinch
(minimum) members bolted to the piles, shall be limited in
location to below the lowest supporting structural member and
above the stable soil elevation, and aligned in the vertical plane
along pile rows perpendicular to the shoreline. Galvanized steel
rods (minimum diameter 1/2 inch) or cable-type bracing is
permitted in any plane.
(10) Knee braces, which stiffen both the upper portion of a pile and the
beam-to-pile connection, may be used along pile rows
perpendicular and parallel to the shoreline. Knee braces shall be
two-by-eight lumber bolted to the sides of the pile/beam, or four-byfour
or larger braces framed into the pile/beam. Bolting shall
§ 158-17 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 158-17
150:134
consist of two five-eighths-inch galvanized steel bolts (each end) for
two-by-eight members, or one five-eighths-inch lag bolt (each end)
for square members. Knee braces shall not extend more than three
feet below the elevation of the base flood.
E. Column foundation design. Masonry piers or poured-in-place concrete
piers shall be internally reinforced to resist vertical and lateral loads,
and be connected with a movement-resisting connection to a pile cap or
pile shaft.
F. Connectors and fasteners. Galvanized metal connectors, wood
connectors, or bolts of size and number adequate for the calculated
loads must be used to connect adjoining components of a structure. Toe
nailing as a principal method of connection is not permitted. All metal
connectors and fasteners used in exposed locations shall be steel, hotdipped
galvanized after fabrication. Connectors in protected interior
locations shall be fabricated from galvanized sheet.
G. Beam-to-pile connections. The primary floor beams or girders shall
span the supports in the direction parallel to the flow of potential
floodwater and wave action and shall be fastened to the columns or
pilings by bolting, with or without cover plates. Concrete members shall
be connected by reinforcement, if cast in place, or, if precast, shall be
securely connected by bolting and welding. If sills, beams, or girders
are attached to wood piling at a notch, a minimum of two five-eighthsinch
galvanized steel bolts or two hot-dipped galvanized straps 3/16
inch by four inches by 18 inches each bolted with two one-half-inch lag
bolts per beam member shall be used. Notching of pile tops shall be the
minimum sufficient to provide ledge support for beam members without
unduly weakening pile connections. Piling shall not be notched so that
the cross section is reduced below 50%.
H. Floor and deck connections.
(1) Wood two-by-four-inch (minimum) connectors or metal joist
anchors shall be used to tie floor joists to floor beams/girders.
These should be installed on alternate floor joists, at a minimum.
Cross bridging of all floor joists shall be provided. Such cross
bridging may be one-by-three-inch members, placed eight feet on
center maximum, or solid bridging of same depth as joist at same
spacing.
(2) Plywood should be used for subflooring and attic flooring to provide
good torsional resistance in the horizontal plane of the structure.
The plywood should not be less than three-fourths-inch total
thickness, and should be exterior grade and fastened to beams or
joists with 8d annular or spiral thread galvanized nails. Such
fastening shall be supplemented by the application of waterproof
industrial adhesive applied to all bearing surfaces.
I. Exterior wall connections. All bottom plates shall have any required
breaks under a wall stud or an anchor bolt. Approved anchors will be
§ 158-17 FIREARMS § 158-17
150:135
used to secure rafters or joists and top and bottom plates to studs in
exterior and bearing walls to form a continuous tie. Continuous 15/
32-inch or thicker plywood sheathing, overlapping the top wall plate

ARTICLE VI
Variance Procedure
§ 158-21. Appeals Board.
A. The Zoning Board of Appeals as established by the Village of
Massapequa Park shall hear and decide appeals and requests for
variances from the requirements of this chapter.
B. The Board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an
error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the local
administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter.
C. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Board may appeal such decision
to the Supreme Court pursuant to Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules.
D. In passing upon such applications, the Board shall consider all technical
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
this chapter and:
(1) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others;
(2) The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(3) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood
damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;
(4) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community;
(5) The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable;
(6) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;
(7) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development;
(8) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program of that area;
(9) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles;
(10) The costs to local governments and the dangers associated with
conducting search and rescue operations during periods of
flooding;
(11) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment
transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site; and
§ 158-21 FIREARMS § 158-21
150:141
§ 158-22. Conditions for variances.
(12) The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including search and rescue operations,
maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as
sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems and streets and bridges.
E. Upon consideration of the factors of Subsection D and the purposes of
this chapter, the Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
F. The local administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions
including technical information and report any variances to the Federal
Emergency Management Agency upon request.
A. Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures
constructed below the base flood elevation, providing items (one
through 12) in § 158-21D have been fully considered. As the lot size
increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required
for issuing the variance increases.
B. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon determination that:
(1) The proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the
structure's continued designation as an historic structure; and
(2) The variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic
character and design of the structure.
C. Variances may be issued by a community for new construction and
substantial improvements and for other development necessary for the
conduct of a functionally dependent use, provided that:
(1) The criteria of Subsections A, D, E and F of this section are met;
and
(2) The structure or other development is protected by methods that
minimize flood damages during the base flood and create no
additional threat to public safety.
D. Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
E. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is
the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
F. Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification of:
(1) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
§ 158-21 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 158-22
150:142
(2) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(3) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or
victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws or
ordinances.
G. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with the
lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given written notice
over the signature of a community official that the cost of flood
insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from
lowest floor elevation.

ARTICLE I
Illegal Occupancies
[Adopted 10-6-2008 by L.L. No. 6-2008]
§ 189-1. Legislative intent; purpose.
The Village Board of Trustees hereby finds that there exist in the Village
of Massapequa Park serious conditions arising from the rental of dwelling
units that are substandard, inadequate in size, overcrowded and/or
dangerous and/or are in violation of local and state law, and that the rental
of such dwelling units poses a significant threat to life, limb and property
of residents of the Village and others, tends to promote and encourage
deterioration of housing within the Village, contributes to excessive
vehicular traffic and parking problems and overburdens and has a
detrimental effect upon municipal services. The Board finds that current
Code provisions are inadequate to adequately deter and/or eliminate the
existence of such dwelling units and that adequate legislation regulating
these occupancies is required to promote and preserve the public health,
safety, welfare and good order and governance of the Village. The
enactment of the regulations set forth in this article, which regulations are
remedial in nature and effect, shall have the effect of enhancing the public
health safety, welfare and good order of the Village.
§ 189-2. Scope.
This article shall apply to all premises and rental dwelling units within
such premises located within the Village of Massapequa Park, whether or
not the use and occupancy thereof shall be permitted under the applicable
use regulations for the zoning district in which such rental dwelling unit is
located.
§ 189-3. Applicability.
The provisions of this article shall be deemed to supplement applicable
state and local laws, ordinances, codes and regulations. Nothing in this
article shall be deemed to abolish, impair, supersede or replace existing
remedies of the Village, county or state or existing requirements of any
other provision of local law or ordinance of the Village or of the county or
state. In situations where there is a conflict between any provisions of this
article and any applicable state or local law, ordinance, code or regulation,
the more restrictive provision or requirement shall prevail.
§ 189-4. Determination of illegal occupancy.
It shall be unlawful to occupy or permit to be occupied or to assist in the
occupancy of a dwelling unit where the number of occupants exceeds the
permitted number of occupants.
A. Presumptions of illegal occupancies in single or one-family dwellings.

Sewer Connections
§ 248-68. Independent system required; exception.
§ 248-69. Use of old drains.
Old drains may be used in connection with new buildings or new plumbing
only when they are found, on examination and test, to conform in all
respects to the requirements governing new drains, as prescribed in this
code. If the old work is found defective, the proper administrative authority
shall notify the owner to make the necessary changes to conform with this
code.
§ 248-70. Location.70
Every new building must have its sewer connection directly in front of the
building unless permission is otherwise granted by the Building Inspector.
§ 248-71. Discontinuance of cesspools.
A. The drainage and plumbing system of each new building and of new
work installed in an existing building shall be separate from and
independent of that of any other building, except as provided below,
and every building shall have an independent connection with a public
or private sewer when available.
B. When one building stands in the rear of another building on an interior
lot and no private sewer is available or can be constructed to the rear
building through an adjoining alley, courtyard or driveway, the house
sewer from the front building may be extended to the rear building, and
the whole will be considered as one house sewer.
A. After an owner has been notified that the lateral sewer line available to
his building has been completed and is ready for use, he may apply for a
permit from the county and village to connect thereto. After such notice
has been given, permits for the cleaning of existing cesspools will be
granted. When a building is connected to the county sewer system, all
cesspools on said property shall be cleaned out, disinfected and
properly and completely backfilled with clean fill.
B. When a septic tank and/or cesspool is being discontinued, the house
sewer may be connected at the inlet of the septic tank and/or cesspool.
C. Where a house sewer is connected at the point of entry to a septic tank
and/or cesspool, connection must be made by bridging with one length
of extra-heavy ductile iron pipe. Pipe must be properly supported at
wall with open space above same to prevent damage to joints in the
event that the septic tank and/or cesspool settles.71

may not be over twice the diameter of the pipe, and it shall be of such length
as will permit inspection of all joints outside the tunnel. All tunnels shall be
backfilled by the use of water.
§ 248-75. Backfilling. [Amended 8-12-1974 by L.L. No. 7-1974]
Adequate precaution shall be taken to ensure proper compaction of backfill
around pipe without damage to piping. Trenches shall be backfilled in thin
layers to 12 inches above the top of the pipe with clean earth, which shall
not contain stones, boulders, cinderfill or other materials which will damage
or break the pipe or cause corrosive action. Mechanical devices may then
be used to finish backfilling to grade. All trenches shall be compacted with
water, using the jetting method.74
§ 248-76. Minimum separations.75
The sewer connection to a building shall have a horizontal or lateral
separation of at least seven feet or a vertical separation of at least two
feet and shall be located below the water service. In the event that any
of the above minimum separations are not possible, permission must be

§ 254-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and cited as the "Property Maintenance Code
of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park."
§ 254-2. Intent and purpose.
It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to provide for and ensure the
proper use of property and to prevent the unsafe, hazardous or dangerous
conditions upon property within the Village of Massapequa Park; to provide
basic and uniform standards governing the maintenance, appearance and
condition of all properties, whether improved or unimproved, residential,
commercial or otherwise. The Village finds that the presence of blight upon
properties, caused by factors, including, but not limited to, foreclosures
throughout the Village, is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare of
the Village. It is the intent, therefore, of the Village that blight be identified,
abated and eliminated and that any and all conditions which pose a threat
to the health and safety of the public or to property within the Village of
Massapequa Park be eliminated. The Board of Trustees finds that upon
the failure to eliminate such conditions, the Village may cause to have
said conditions eliminated and assess the cost thereof against the owners,
occupants or other persons as set forth in this chapter.

thereof. The filing of such sworn statement shall constitute a lien and

delinquent penalty at the rate of interest in the event that the same is
not paid in full on or before the date the tax bill upon which such charge

property on the "Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park Blighted
Property Registry."

registration fee as set forth herein shall be assessed to the property
within 15 days of the notice. The parties responsible may request a

and interest, plus cost of court, if any, for collection, until final payment
has been made. Said costs and expenses shall be a lien on the property
and shall be collected in the manner fixed by law for the collection of
taxes, and, further, shall be subject to a delinquent penalty at the rate of
interest in the event that the same is not paid in full on or before the
date the tax bill upon which such charge appears becomes delinquent.
Sworn statements filed in accordance with the provisions hereof shall
be prima facie evidence that all legal formalities have been complied
with and shall be full notice to every person concerned that the amount
of the statement, plus interest, constitutes a statement that the same is
due and collectible as provided by law.
E. The Building Inspector may reduce or waive the registration fee,

therefor;

WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS AND
FACILITIES
GENERAL REFERENCES
Electrical standards  See Ch. 128.
Zoning  See Ch. 345.
Fee  See Ch. A350.
§ 272-1. Title.
This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Regulation of Wireless
Telecommunications Towers and Facilities."
§ 272-2. Purpose and intent.
A. On February 8, 1996, the United States Congress enacted the
Telecommunications Act of 1996 (hereinafter referred to as the "Act").
The purpose of the Act is to provide a more competitive environment for
wired and wireless communication services in the United States by
deregulating the telecommunications industry. The Act preserves the
authority of local government to regulate the placement, construction,
and modification of personal wireless services antennas, towers and
accessory structures in order to protect the health, safety, and welfare
of the public.
B. The purpose of this chapter is to establish predictable and balanced
regulations for the siting and screening of personal wireless services
antennas, towers, and accessory structures. The establishment of such
regulations is to accommodate the growth of such systems within the
Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park (hereinafter referred to as the
"Village"). Such regulations will further serve to protect the public
against any adverse impacts on aesthetic resources. Additionally, the
regulations will eliminate potential damage to adjacent properties from
tower failure through structural standards and setback requirements.
Finally, the regulations set forth in this chapter will reduce the number
of towers needed to service the community by maximizing the use of
existing towers and structures.
C. This chapter is intended to regulate the placement, construction, and
modification of towers and telecommunications facilities in order to
protect the health, safety, and welfare of the public while at the sane
time not unreasonably interfering with the development of the
competitive wireless telecommunications marketplace in the Village.
Specifically, this chapter is intended to:
(1) Regulate the location of the towers and telecommunications
facilities in the Village;
§ 268-24 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 272-2
272:290
§ 272-3. Definitions.
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this chapter, shall
have the meaning ascribed to them in this section, except where the context
clearly indicates a different meaning:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURES  Accessory buildings and structures,
including base stations designed and used to shelter equipment and/or
to support personal wireless services. The term "accessory structures"
does not include offices, long-term storage of vehicles or other equipment
storage, or broadcast studios.
ANTENNA  The actual device which transmits and/or receives radio or
electromagnetic waves.
(2) Protect residential areas and land uses within and adjacent to the
Village from potential adverse impacts of towers and
telecommunications facilities;
(3) Minimize adverse visual impacts of towers and telecommunications
facilities through careful design, siting, landscaping, and
innovative camouflaging techniques;
(4) Promote and encourage shared use/collocation of towers and
antenna support structures as a primary option rather than
construction of additional single-use towers;
(5) Promote and encourage utilization of technological designs that
will either eliminate or reduce the need for erection of new tower
structures to support antenna and telecommunications facilities;
(6) Avoid potential damage to property caused by towers and
telecommunications facilities by ensuring such structures are
soundly and carefully designed, constructed, modified, maintained,
and removed when no longer used or determined to be structurally
unsound; and
(7) Ensure that towers and telecommunications facilities are
compatible with surrounding land uses.
D. The Communications Act of 1934, as amended by the Act, grants the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) exclusive jurisdiction over:
(1) The regulation of the environmental effects of radio frequency (RF)
emission from telecommunications facilities; and
(2) The regulations of radio signal interference among users of the RF
spectrum.
E. The Village's regulation of towers and telecommunications facilities in
the Village will not have the effect of prohibiting any person from
providing wireless telecommunications services in violation of the Act.

§ 272-6 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 272-7
272:296
A. A proposal for a tower shall not be approved unless the Board of
Trustees finds that the antenna planned for the proposed tower cannot
be accommodated on an existing or approved tower or building within a
one-mile search radius (one-half-mile search radius for towers under
120 feet in height, one-quarter-mile search radius for towers under 80
feet in height) of the proposed tower due to one or more of the following
reasons:
(1) The antenna would exceed the structural capacity of the existing or
approved tower or building, as documented by a qualified
professional engineer, and the existing or approved tower cannot
be reinforced, modified, or replaced to accommodate the planned
or equivalent antenna at a reasonable cost.
(2) The antenna would cause interference materially impacting the
usability of other existing or planned antenna at the tower or
building, as documented by a qualified professional engineer, and
the interference cannot be prevented at a reasonable cost.
(3) Existing or approved towers and buildings within the search radius
cannot accommodate the antenna at a height necessary to function
reasonably, as documented by a qualified professional engineer.
(4) Other foreseen reasons that make it infeasible to locate the
antenna upon an existing or approved tower or building.
B. Any proposed tower shall be designed, structurally, electrically, and in
all respects, to accommodate both the applicant's antennas and
comparable antennas for at least two additional users if the tower is
over 100 feet in height or for at least one additional user if the tower is
over 60 feet in height. Towers must be designed to allow for future
rearrangement of antennas upon the tower and to accept antennas
mounted at varying heights. The applicant shall submit to the Board of
Trustees a letter of intent committing the applicant, and his/her
successors in interest, to negotiate in good faith for shared use of the
proposed tower by other personal wireless service providers in the
future. The issuance of a special use permit (assuming the tower is
approved according to this section), shall commit the new tower owner
and his/her successors in interest to:
(1) Respond in a timely comprehensive manner to a request for
information from a potential shared-use applicant.
(2) Negotiate in good faith concerning future requests for shared use
of the new tower by other personal wireless service providers.
(3) Allow shared use of the new tower if another personal wireless
service provider agrees in writing to pay charges.
(4) Make no more than a reasonable charge for shared use, based on
generally accepted accounting principles. The charge may include,
but is not limited to, a prorata share of the cost of site selection,
§ 272-7 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 272-7
272:297
§ 272-8. Setbacks.
Towers and all accessory structures shall conform with each of the following
minimum setback requirements:
planning, project administration, land costs, site design,
construction and maintenance financing, return on equity, and
depreciation, and all of the costs of adapting the tower or
equipment to accommodate a shared user without causing
electromagnetic interference.
C. In order to keep neighboring municipalities informed, and to facilitate
the possibility of directing that an existing tall structure or existing
tower in a neighboring municipality be considered for shared use, the
Board of Trustees shall require that:
(1) An applicant who proposes a new tower shall notify in writing the
legislative body of each municipality that borders the Village and
the County Planning Commission. Notification shall include the
exact location of the proposed tower and a general description of
the project including, but not limited to the height of the tower and
its capacity for future shared use.
(2) Documentation of this modification shall be submitted to the Board
of Trustees at the time of application.
A. All towers up to 100 feet in height shall be set back on all sides a
distance equal to the underlying setback requirement in the applicable
zoning district. Towers in excess of 100 feet in height shall be set back
one additional foot per each foot of tower height in excess of 100 feet.
B. Setback requirements for towers shall be measured from the base of
the tower to the property line of the parcel of land on which it is
located.
C. Setback requirements may be modified, as provided in § 272-21B(1),
when placement of a tower in a location which will reduce the visual
impact can be accomplished. For example, adjacent to trees which may
visually hide the tower.
D. The minimum setbacks of the underlying zoning district shall be met,
with the exception of industrial zoning districts, where towers and
accessory structures may encroach into the rear setback area, provided
that the real property line abuts another industrially zoned property
and the tower does not encroach upon any easements.
E. Towers and accessory structures shall be set back from the planned
public rights-of-way, as shown on the most recently adopted plan or
map of the Village showing such rights of way, by a minimum distance
equal to 1/2 of the height of the tower including all antennas and
attachments.
§ 272-7 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 272-8
272:298
§ 272-9. Structural requirements.
All towers must be designed and certified by an engineer to be structurally
sound and, at a minimum, in conformance with the Village Code, and any
other standards outlined in this chapter. All towers in operation shall be
affixed to land.
§ 272-10. Separation or buffer requirements.
For the purpose of this chapter, the separation distances between towers
shall be measured by drawing or following a straight line between the
base of the existing or approved structure and the proposed base, pursuant
to a site plan, of the proposed tower. Tower separation distances from
residentially zoned lands shall be measured from the base of a tower to the
closest point of residentially zoned property. The minimum tower separation
distances from residentially zoned land and from other towers shall be
calculated and applied irrespective of Village jurisdictional boundaries.
§ 272-11. Method of determining tower height.
Measurement of tower height for the purpose of determining compliance
with all requirements of this chapter shall include the tower structure itself,
the base pad, and any other telecommunications facilities attached thereto
which extend more than 20 feet over the top of the tower structure itself.
Tower height shall be measured from grade.
§ 272-12. Illumination.
Towers shall not be artificially lighted except as required by the Federal
Aviation Administration or other federal or state authority for a particular
tower. Upon commencement of construction of a tower, in cases where
there are residential uses located within a distance which is 300% of the
F. A tower's setback may be reduced in the sole discretion of the Board of
Trustees to allow the integration of a tower into an existing or proposed
structure such as a church steeple, light pole, power line, or similar
structure.
A. Towers shall be separated from all residentially zoned lands by a
minimum of 200 feet or 200% of the height of the proposed tower,
whichever is greater.
B. Proposed towers must meet the following minimum separation
requirements from existing towers or towers which have a special use
permit but are not yet constructed at the time a special use permit is
granted pursuant to this chapter:
(1) Monopole tower structures shall be separated from all other
towers, whether monopole or self-supporting lattice by a minimum
of 1/4 mile.
§ 272-8 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS TOWERS § 272-12
272:299
height of the tower from the tower and when required by federal law, dual
mode lighting shall be requested from the Federal Aviation Administration.
§ 272-13. Design of antennas, towers and accessory structures.
Antennas, towers and accessory structure shall be designed to blend into
the surrounding environment through the use of color and camouflaging
architectural treatment, except in instances where the color is indicated
by federal or state authorities such as the Federal Aviation Administration.
Every antenna, tower and accessory structure shall be of neutral colors that
are harmonious with, and that blend with, the natural features, buildings
and structures surrounding such antenna and structure; provided however,
that directional or panel antenna and omnidirectional or whip antennas
located on the exterior of a building that will also serve as an antenna
tower shall be of colors that match, and cause the antenna to blend with,
the exterior of the building. Accessory structures will be designed to be
architecturally compatible with principal structures on the site.
§ 272-14. Landscaping and security of structures.
All landscaping on a parcel of land containing towers, antenna support
structures, or telecommunications facilities shall be in accordance with the
applicable landscaping requirements in the zoning district where the tower,
antenna support structure, or telecommunications facilities are located.
The Village may require landscaping in excess of the requirements in the
Village Code in order to enhance compatibility with adjacent land uses.
Landscaping shall be installed on the outside of any fencing. Existing onsite
vegetation shall be preserved to the maximum extent practicable. The
base of the tower and any accessory structure shall be landscaped. Towers
and accessory structures shall be provided with security fencing to prevent
unauthorized entry.
§ 272-15. Access.
A parcel of land upon which a tower is located must provide access to at
least one paved vehicular parking space on site. A road and parking will be
provided to assure adequate emergency and service access. Maximum use
of existing roads, public or private, shall be made.
§ 272-16. Stealth design.
All towers shall be of stealth design.
§ 272-17. Telecommunications facilities on antenna support
structures.
Any telecommunications facilities which are not attached to a tower may be

discrete operating telecommunications facilities of any person
currently installed on the tower.
(2) An application for a special use permit is made to the Board of
Trustees which shall have the authority to issue a special use

in conformance with the requirements of the Building Code and all
other construction standards set forth by the Village's Code and federal

A. Whether the technology in the provision of personal wireless services
has changed such that the necessity for the special use permit at the

B. Whether the special use permit should be modified or terminated as a
result of any such change.
§ 272-27 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 274-1
274:306
§ 274-1. Statutory authorization.
Pursuant to the provisions of the New York State Constitution, the
Municipal Home Rule Law, the Suburban Town Law, the General Municipal
Law, the Town Law and the Village Law, all as amended, the Board of
Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park is empowered to
enact local laws and ordinances licensing and regulating occupations and
the conduct of business to protect and promote the health, safety, morals
or the general welfare of the community. Therefore, the Village Board of
the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park enacts this chapter, entitled
"Secondhand Dealers."
§ 274-2. Findings of fact.
A. There is no control in the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park
governing the activities of those persons engaged in the business of
buying and selling secondhand merchandise. Some of these dealers
represent to those persons involved in crime an opportunity to dispose
of stolen property. If the law enforcement agencies are to function, an
ordinance regulating these secondhand establishments is necessary.
B. The ease with which some secondhand dealers buy and dispose of
personal property indicates the need for the enactment of laws to
control and regulate their everyday business transactions. A few of the
dealers require scant or, very often, no identification when purchasing
personal property, and rarely, if ever, is proof of ownership requested.
C. It is a fact that secondhand dealers are not required, at the present
time, to forward reports of acquired used property to many of the police
agencies. With the passage of this chapter, reports would be required
from dealers in secondhand jewelry, marine equipment, antiques,
cameras, coins, stamps, musical instruments, firearms and televisions,
as well as stereophonic equipment. As a result of the reporting, there
would be a marked increase in the number of restitutions for the sole
reason that now these merchants would be committed to keeping
accurate records of the used property purchased and disposed of, by
forwarding the proper reports to the police, on a daily basis, at the close
of each business day.
D. This problem involving stolen property is not confined solely to the
small dealers. Some of the very largest retailers in the nation, those
whose stores are located in the Incorporated Village of Massapequa
Park, buy large quantities of old gold, jewelry and diamonds and
forward not one single report of purchase to any police agency in the
county. The scope for the exploitation of stolen property is further
broadened due to the operations of these merchandising giants.
E. For small or large business enterprises to be allowed to continue to
operate without laws to control and regulate the purchase of
secondhand articles not only jeopardizes the property rights of many

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:

principal, broker or agent:
§ 274-5. Construal of provisions.
Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to apply to:
people but also extremely hampers the police agencies in their efforts
to recover stolen property and identify suspects.
A. The security involved in the handling of secondhand property has
become a matter of concern to the police agencies charged with the
duty and responsibility therein.
B. The increase in the incidence of property thefts, the widespread use of
alcohol and drugs, the decline in the value of the dollar, the increase in
the price of gold and diamonds and the specter of inflation, where
barter becomes more of a reality, all point to the imperative that the
best interests of the people of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa
Park would be served by the enactment of this chapter.
C. This chapter will ensure a dramatic rise in the percentage of stolen
property recovered and an increase in the probability that the general
public will receive a fairer deal in their business transactions, and will
better the means to allow the police agencies to obtain more
information necessary to apprehend perpetrators of crimes associated
with the theft of property. Thereby the public health, morals and
general welfare of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park will be
protected and promoted.
Deals in the commercial purchase or sale of secondhand articles for any

the purpose of determining whether or not merchandise is in new or used
condition.
§ 274-7. Interpretation of provisions.
In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, the rule of
interpretation applicable to remedial legislation shall be used so that the
spirit and intent of this chapter shall be observed. All provisions shall
be considered as minimum requirements and deemed neither to limit nor
repeal any other powers granted to the Incorporated Village of Massapequa
Park under New York State statutes.

E. The first sale, at retail, of merchandise which has been rebuilt by the
manufacturer or vendor originally manufacturing it, or the licensed
agents thereof, and sold as factory-rebuilt merchandise.
F. A thrift shop, as defined to be so classified under the United States
Internal Revenue Code, entitled to an exemption as an eleemosynary
corporation or institution.
G. Antiques, which shall mean secondhand articles over 50 years of age,
having a value of less than $250 and void of any means of identification.

Residency Restrictions
[Adopted 3-23-2009 by L.L. No. 1-2009]
§ 279-1. Findings; legislative authority; intent.
§ 279-2. Definitions.
For purposes of this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
DOMICLE  A person's true, fixed permanent home or fixed place of
habitation.
PARK  Any park, playground, athletic field, swimming pool operated by
the Village of Massapequa Park, the Massapequa School District, the

REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER  A sex offender who is required to register
with the New York State Division of Criminal Justice Services, or other
A. The Board of Trustees of the Incorporated Village of Massapequa Park
("Village Board") recognizes that the Sex Offender Registration Act,
New York's version of Megan's Law (Correction Law Article 6-C), has
increased public awareness of sex offenders by requiring them to
become registered with authorities and making such information
available to the public.
B. The Village Board finds that registered sex offenders pose a significant
threat to the health and safety of the community and especially to
children, whose age and inexperience make them particularly
vulnerable to the heinous and reprehensible acts of these offenders.
The Village Board also finds that the rate of recidivism is high, and
programs designed to treat and rehabilitate these types of offenders
have been largely ineffective. The Village Board further finds that
restricting registered sex offenders from residing in close proximity to
places where children are likely to congregate is likely to reduce the
opportunity and temptation for, and can minimize the risk of, repeated
acts against minors.
C. It is the intention of the Village Board to exercise its authority pursuant
to Article IX of the New York State Constitution and § 10 of the
Municipal Home Rule Law to protect and safeguard the lives and wellbeing
of the community, especially minors, from registered sexual
offenders by prohibiting registered sex offenders from residing in close
proximity to places where children could naturally congregate, such as
schools and parks.
D. This article is intended to create a civil, nonpunitive regulatory scheme
in order to protect minors to the extent possible under the
circumstances and not as a punitive measure of any kind.

agency having jurisdiction pursuant to the provision of Article 6-C of the
Correction Law of the State of New York or other applicable or successor

with the law of the court of competent jurisdiction.
RESIDENCE  The place where a person sleeps, which may include more
than one location, and may be mobile or transitory.
SCHOOL  A building or property, the principal purpose and use of which
is as a place of education, including, but not limited to, public or private
preschool, elementary and secondary schools, vocational schools and other
non-degree-granting schools, including self-defense, dance, swimming,
gymnastics and similar instruction/programs.

or domicle within a one-mile radius of:
§ 279-4. Notice; relocation required.
Any registered sex offender who establishes a residence or domicile in
violation of the residency restrictions set forth in § 279-3 of this article shall
have 30 days from receipt of a written notice from the Village Clerk to
relocate to a location which does not violate the restrictions set forth in
§ 279-3 of this article.

Nothing in this article shall be deemed to impose any civil or criminal
liability upon, or give rise to a course of action against, the Village of
Massapequa Park or to any official, employee or department of the Village
for failing to act in accordance with this article.

allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the SMO
prior to the time of the test.
(4) The prohibition shall not apply to any discharge permitted under an
SPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the
Department, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with
all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other
applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written
approval has been granted for any discharge to the MS4.
B. Prohibition of illicit connections.
(1) The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit
connections to the MS4 is prohibited.
(2) This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection

the time of connection.
§ 293-6 STORM SEWERS § 293-6
293:355
§ 293-7. Prohibition against activities contaminating stormwater.
§ 293-8. Prevention, control and reduction of stormwater pollutants
by use of best management practices.
Best management practices. Where the SMO has identified illicit discharges
as defined in § 293-2 or activities contaminating stormwater as defined in
§ 293-7, the municipality may require implementation of best management
practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and activities.
§ 293-9. Suspension of access to MS4.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this article if the person
connects a line conveying sewage to the municipality's MS4, or
allows such a connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the municipality being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 293-2, Definitions, of this article.
B. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES
permit authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to
correct such activities such that he or she no longer causes or
contributes to violations of the municipality's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization.
A. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at his or her own expense, reasonable protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the
MS4 through the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
B. Any person responsible for a property or premises which is or may be
the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 293-2 or an activity
contaminating stormwater as defined in § 293-7 may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutants to
the MS4.
C. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section.
A. Illicit discharges in emergency situations. The SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
§ 293-6 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 293-9
293:356
§ 293-10. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the municipality prior to the allowing of discharges to the
MS4.
§ 293-11. Applicability; access to facilities; monitoring of
discharges.
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this article may
have his or her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate
or reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing
of the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this article, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this article.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
§ 293-9 STORM SEWERS § 293-11
293:357
§ 293-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed
and mailed to the municipality within three business days of the telephone
notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial
or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment
shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
article.
(3) The municipality shall have the right to set up on any facility
subject to this article such devices as are necessary, in the opinion
of the SMO, to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's
stormwater discharge.
(4) The municipality has the right to require the facilities subject to
this article to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably
necessary to determine compliance with this article. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at
its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and
quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the municipality access to a
facility subject to this article is a violation of this article. A person
who is the operator of a facility subject to this article commits an
offense if the person denies the municipality reasonable access to
the facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this article.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 293-11 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 293-12
293:358
taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least
three years.
§ 293-13. Enforcement; penalties for offenses.
A. Notice of violation. When the municipality's SMO finds that a person
has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article,
he/she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require, without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(5) Payment of a fine; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.
(7) If abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $350 or
imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense, both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $700 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense, all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than $1,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this article shall be deemed
misdemeanors, and, for such purpose only, all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.
§ 293-12 STORM SEWERS § 293-14
293:359
§ 293-14. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Village Board of Trustees within 15 days of its issuance,
which shall hear the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal,
and within five days of making its decision, file its decision in the office of
the Municipal Clerk and mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the
discharger.
§ 293-15. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 293-16. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this article. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this article, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 293-17. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this article, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Municipal Attorney and concurrence of the
Municipal Code Enforcement Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this article.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.
(4) The violator acted quickly to remedy violation.
§ 293-14 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 293-17
293:360
§ 293-18. Violations deemed a public nuisance.

ARTICLE I
Findings of Fact; Purpose; Statutory Authority; Applicability;
Exemptions
§ 294-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 294-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter and Chapter 345, Art. X is to establish minimum
stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and
safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing
within this jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 294-1 hereof.
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and
other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing streambank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream baseflow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the Village of Massapequa Park;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and
nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.

hardened sufficiently to avoid breaking the edges or corners of the
slabs. Where division plates have not been used, the partially set
concrete shall be cut through to the subgrade.
(2) All surface edges of concrete slabs shall be tooled so as to be
rounded to a radius of approximately 1/4 inch.
(3) Expansion joints shall be constructed for the full depth of the
concrete. They shall not be less than 1/2 inch wide and spaced not
more than 20 feet apart. Expansion joints shall also be provided at
intersecting sidewalks or curbs and along the curb in business

J. Finishing.
(1) A curb shall be struck off true to the cross section required, after
which it shall be finished smooth by means of a wooden float. Face
forms shall be left in place until the concrete has set sufficiently so
that they can be removed without injury to the curb. The exposed
face of the curb will be finished smooth by means of a moist wooden
float or a moist wet brick. The edges shall be rounded with an
edging tool.
(2) All sidewalks shall be finished by screeding with a light weight-type
hand screed which will push the surplus concrete ahead of it. Any
depressions or voids created will be immediately filled in and such
surfaces will be rescreeded. The surface shall then be completed by
floating the concrete with hand floats, taking care to leave a
minimum of float marks. All edges shall be rounded with a steel
edging tool to a minimum radius of 1/4 inch.
(3) Curing. All cement work exposed to a hot summer sun as soon as
finished must be covered from the sun for two days and kept moist
by sprinkling morning and afternoon until thoroughly set.

Specifications for Soil Cement Base Pavement
§ 300-27. Performance of work.
§ 300-28. Materials.
A. Under this section, the developers and/or their contractors shall finegrade
the pavement areas and construct a soil cement base pavement
having a minimum compacted thickness of five inches. The base
pavement will conform to the lines, grades and typical sections shown
on the plans and be in accordance with these specifications and the
directions of the Engineer.
B. The soil cement base pavement shall consist of a simple, intimate
mixture of pulverized soil, measured quantities of portland cement,
calcium chloride and water, combined, uniformly mixed, compacted,
finished and cured to form a hard, durable, semirigid base pavement.
C. The preparation and admixing of soils for the soil cement base
pavement is to be included as a part of this section.
A. Portland cement shall be Type 1 conforming to ASTM C-150. One cubic
foot of cement shall be considered to weigh 94 pounds. Cement will be
paid for separately.
B. Water shall be free from oil, acid alkali, vegetable or organic matter and
all other substances deleterious to the hardening of the soil-cement
mixture. The developers and/or their contractors shall procure all such
necessary water at their own expense.
C. Soil shall consist of the in-place materials existing within the area to be
paved, approved selected borrow materials or a combination of both
these materials in order to correct deficiencies in the existing grade
and/or to provide more favorable soil characteristics.
D. Calcium chloride.
(1) Calcium chloride shall be in the form of loose dry lumps or flakes
and fine enough to feed readily through the common forms of
spreaders used in roadwork and shall meet the requirements of
ASTM Designation D 98.
(2) The calcium chloride shall be delivered in containers of a type
acceptable to the Engineer. The name of the manufacturer, the
approximate net weight and the percentage of calcium chloride
(CaC12) guaranteed by the manufacturer shall be plainly marked
on the container.
§ 300-27 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 300-29
300:429
§ 300-29. Equipment.
All equipment shall be of an approved type, in first-class mechanical and
operating condition and of adequate capacity to properly perform the
required work in a satisfactory manner. The equipment shall be such as
to ensure proper pulverization of soils, accurate application of cement
and water, thorough mixing and incorporation of all materials, compaction,
finishing and curing of the pavement as required. Standby equipment shall
be available to the developers and/or their contractors so as to be in
operation within one hour after any breakdown occurs on the job.
§ 300-30. Preparation of subbase.
§ 300-31. Fine grading and soil cement construction.
A. Generally. The subbase shall be defined as that portion of the roadbed
or parking field upon which the soil cement base pavement is to be
placed. The subbase soils shall be defined as that thickness of soils
below the base pavement as may need to be stabilized by materials
admixed therein to form a suitable subbase for a pavement of several or
more courses. The developers and/or contractors shall remove all
boulders, mulch, soft clay and other objectionable materials to such
depths as may be directed by the Engineer. These areas are to be
backfilled with acceptable material to subgrade for base pavement.
B. Preparation of base pavement soils. Depending upon the character of
soil encountered at base pavement elevations, all or parts of the base
pavement soils, where directed by the Engineer, shall be improved with
material added from the excavation or borrowed. The developers and/or
their contractors shall save, during the excavation operation, sufficient
selected materials for this purpose. Suitable loamy, silty or sandy soils
shall he added to form a stable base for a minimum of six inches
compacted thickness. The areas to be treated in cuts shall be excavated
to a depth of three inches below soil cement pavement or more as
directed by the Engineer. A layer of proper-type material between three
and five inches loose measure shall be spread over the area and
thoroughly mixed to a depth of six inches by scarifying or other method
approved by the Engineer. The base soils shall then be shaped and
compacted to the approximate finished line and grade. Smooth-wheel
rollers weighing at least 10 tons shall be used for compaction. Shaping,
filling and rolling shall continue until the base pavement soils are
compacted to a depth of six inches and are within two inches of final
grade and ready for the fine-grading operation. Where required, water
shall be added to effect compaction. The base pavement soils shall be
kept free from ruts and depressions and properly drained.
A. Prior to starting construction of the soil cement base pavement, the
developers and/or their contractors shall complete all fine grading of
the area as is required to establish the completed work to the lines,
grades, thickness and typical section shown on the plans. All unsuitable
§ 300-29 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 300-31
300:430
soils or other materials shall be removed, disposed of off the site and
replaced with acceptable material obtained on the site or from off-site
borrow as required and directed by the Engineer.
B. The subgrade of the area to be paved shall be firm, stable and capable
of supporting all construction equipment employed and permit the
required compaction of the soil cement mixture. All soft yielding or
unstable subbase soils shall be satisfactorily corrected before
construction of the pavement is initiated.
C. After all fine grading has been completed and subbase properly
prepared, the area to be processed shall be prewetted if necessary,
scarified and pulverized as required. It shall then be bladed and leveled
to approximate true grade and section. Pulverizing of soil materials
shall continue until 100% by dry weight passes a one-inch sieve and a
minimum of 80% passes a No. 4 sieve, exclusive of retained gravel and
stone after completion of moist mixing. All gravel, stone and
unpulverized road metal over 1 1/2 inches in size shall be removed from
the site. No stones greater than two inches in size shall be permitted in
the soil cement mixture.
D. Before the cement is distributed and spread upon the soil, calcium
chloride at the rate of 0.6% by weight of soil shall be evenly distributed
over the entire area of the soil cement pavement. An approved spreader
shall be used to distribute the calcium chloride.
E. Cement.
(1) Portland cement of the type specified shall be uniformly distributed
and evenly spread over the area at the rate of not less than 47
pounds per square yard. The developers and/or their contractors
shall furnish suitable equipment of an approved type for handling,
accurate weighing and spreading of the cement where bulk cement
is used. When bag cement is used, the containers shall be
accurately spotted and spaced in such manner as to ensure that the
required quantity of cement will be obtained with uniform
distribution over the area to be processed.
(2) The percentage of moisture in the soil at the time of cement
application shall not exceed the quantity that will permit a uniform
and intimate mixture of soil materials and cement during mixing
operations.
(3) All displaced cement shall be replaced prior to starting mixing
operations.
(4) No cement shall be applied when the soil materials or the subgrade
is frozen. Air temperature in the shade shall be at least 40º F. and
rising.
§ 300-31 SUBDIVISION OF LAND § 300-31
300:431
(5) Distribution of bulk cement over the area to be processed shall be
accomplished by a cement spreader equipped with suitable device
to accurately regulate and control the quantity of cement spread.
(6) Where bag cement and hand pumping is employed, bags shall be
emptied to form a uniform transverse windrow across the
processing area and spread by means of a spike-tooth harrow, nail
drag or other approved equipment. A sufficient number of passes
shall be made to ensure a uniform and even distribution of cement
over the area.
F. Equipment for mixing the soil cement shall be a traveling mixing
machine of the multiple-pass rotary type. Window mixing will not be
permitted under any conditions. After spreading of cement has
advanced sufficiently, the developers and/or their contractors shall
proceed with dry mixing and blending together of cement and the soil
materials. The operation shall continue only until cement is sufficiently
blended with the soil to prevent formation of cement balls when water
is applied. Complete and thorough mixing of the material is not
essential for this phase of the processing.
G. Water.
(1) Water supply shall be adequate and the equipment for its
application and distribution shall be pressure type of such capacity
to ensure that the complete application of the total quantity
required will be accomplished within a period of not more than
three hours.
(2) The total quantity to be applied shall be such as will bring the
entire soil cement mixture to optimum moisture content or slightly
above. It shall not be of such excessive quantity as will result in the
mixture becoming unstable during the compaction and finishing
operation.
(3) The developers and/or their contractors shall proceed with the
application and incorporation of water and mixing of the soil
cement immediately after the dry mixing is completed. Water shall
be applied uniformly, and excessive concentrations on or near the
surface shall be avoided. Each increment of water applied shall be
incorporated and mixed with the soil cement mixture before
applying the next increment.
(4) After all required water has been applied, mixing shall continue
until a uniform, intimate and homogenous mixture of soil, cement
and water is obtained for the full width and required depth of the
area being processed. The mixture shall be of a uniform color and
free of wet or dry streaks or stratas.
(5) The percentage of moisture in the completed mixture, based on
over-dry weight, shall not be below or more than 20% above
optimum moisture content as determined by moisture density test
§ 300-31 MASSAPEQUA PARK CODE § 300-31
300:432
ASTM Designation D-1557, Method C, on representative samples of
the mixture obtained in the area being processed.
H. Shaping.
(1) Compaction of the soil cement mixture shall be with pneumatic
tired or sheepsfoot rollers. Shaping shall be performed with a
motor-grader. Spike-tooth harrow or nail drag shall be employed
for removal of compaction planes.
(2) The moisture content of the mixture shall be maintained at not less
than the optimum during the entire compaction operation. The
entire area shall be compacted to a density of not less than 95% of
the maximum density. Weight of roller equipment shall be the
heaviest that will not overstress the soil and not less than 12 tons.
(3) Rolling shall start at the edges and proceed to the center;
compaction to specified density shall be satisfactorily completed
within a period of two hours.
(4) After rolling and compaction has advanced sufficiently, the surface
shall be shaped and trued with a motor grader as necessary to
obtain uniform compaction and required grade and cross-section.
Compacting, rolling and shaping shall continue as required until
the specified density is obtained and the surface is true to line,
grade and cross section. Water shall be applied as necessary to
maintain and provide the required moisture content. Compaction
planes shall be removed from the surface by use of equipment
stipulated above.
(5) Final surface of pavement shall be developed by use of steel wheel
or pneumatic tired rollers, or both, compacting to specified density.
When directed, final rolling shall be supplemented with broom
drag.
(6) The completed surface shall be smooth, dense, free of compaction
planes, cracks, ridges or loose materials and true to line, grade and
section. The pavement shall be at least the specified thickness and
the density not less than the minimum specified. Any portion of the
pavement found to have a density less than 95% maximum density
as determined by standard test procedures shall be rectified or
removed and replaced by the developers and/or their contractors at
no additional cost to the village.
I. Curing.
(1) After the soil cement has been satisfactorily finished, the
developers and/or their contractors shall cure the completed
pavement for a period of not less than three days. Bituminous
material shall be applied to the pavement surface at the
approximate rate of 0.20 gallon per square yard. Curing material
shall be applied not more than 12 hours after finishing operations

ARTICLE II
Booting
§ 314-13. Legislative finding and intent.
It is hereby found and declared that the practice of "booting" vehicles
parked on private property or private parking lots or public property or
public streets accessible to the public poses a danger to the safety and
welfare of the public because such practice may prevent the removal of
such vehicles, even when such removal may be necessitated by an
emergency. Booting may also cause dangerous confrontations between
owners of vehicles and the person booting their cars. Owners of private
parking lots wishing to maintain parking for rule-abiding customers or
residents are primarily interested in keeping spaces available to legitimate
users; no service is performed, therefore, by immobilizing vehicles and
preventing legitimate use of the space occupied. Private persons should
therefore be prohibited from engaging in the practice of booting.
§ 314-14. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOOT  The act of placing on a parked motor vehicle a mechanical device
that is designed to be attached to the wheel or tire or other part of such
vehicle so as to prohibit its movement.
PERSONS AUTHORIZED TO BOOT VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PARKING
LOTS  No person other than a police officer or a person acting under the
direction of the Police Department, who may, for the purpose of enforcing
any private or public parking rules or regulations, boot or authorize the
booting of a motor vehicle parked on a private parking lot.
PRIVATE PARKING LOT  Any area or areas of private property near or
contiguous to and provided in connection with premises having one or more
stores, business establishments or residences and used by the public as a
means of access to and egress from such stores, businesses and residences
and for the parking of motor vehicles of customers, patrons and residents of
such stores, businesses and residences.
PUBLIC PROPERTY AND PUBLIC STREETS  Any area or areas of public
property or public streets within the Incorporated Village of Massapequa
Park.
§ 314-15. Prohibition of booting.
It is unlawful for any person or entity to immobilize any motor vehicle
parked in the Village by any means, including, but not limited to, what
is commonly referred to as "booting." No property owner or tenant shall
authorize any person to so immobilize any motor vehicle. If so, that person
or entity shall be in violation of this chapter and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor.
§ 314-13 TENTS § 314-16
310:489
§ 314-16. Violations and penalties.
Any person who shall violate any provision of this article, upon conviction
thereof, shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor. Any person, corporation,
partnership or entity violating any terms or provision of this chapter shall
be guilty of a violation and shall be subject to a mandatory minimum fine of
$250, plus that term of imprisonment relating to a conviction of a Class B
misdemeanor.

This chapter shall take effect immediately.

Forty-eight hours' notice, by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by
personal service or any other legal means, shall be given by the village to
the lawful owner of said motor vehicle which is inoperable or abandoned
before said motor vehicle, which is either inoperable or abandoned on
residential streets as stated above, shall be removed or towed away by the
village.
§ 320-6. Storage charge; disposition of unclaimed vehicles.
§ 320-7. Safety hazards and attractive nuisances.

by the village to any person before said motor vehicle is towed away by the

attractive environment, it is declared to be of importance to the health,
safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the village to safeguard their
material rights against unwarranted invasion. Such an environment is
deemed essential to the maintenance and continued development of the
economy of the Village of Massapequa Park.
B. The unrestrained accumulation of unregistered motor vehicles is a
hazard to such health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the village,
necessitating the regulation, restraint and elimination thereof. This
chapter is enacted in recognition of the fact that even a single
unregistered motor vehicle, abandoned or stored on private or public
property:
(1) Can constitute both a public and private nuisance.
(2) Is a source of potential hurt to children and others who find them
an attractive nuisance.
(3) Is often replete with broken glass, sharp torn metal edges and
points, gasoline remaining in tanks of a highly combustible and
explosive nature and hurtful acids in batteries, to mention a few of
the obvious sources of physical hurt found in junk vehicles.
(4) Constitutes a blight on the Village of Massapequa Park landscape.
(5) Destroys the aesthetic qualities of the village and is generally
unsightly.
(6) Tends to depreciate not only the property on which it is located, but
also the property of other persons in the neighborhood and the
village generally.
(7) Makes the village a less safe and pleasant place in which to live and
to do business.
(8) Damages the welfare of the village as a whole.
(9) Tends to result in the uncontrolled growth of grass and weeds.
(10) Tends to result in the uncontrolled collection of debris.

from the street layout as shown on the Zoning Map, the Zoning Board of
Appeals may apply the designation shown on the mapped streets in
such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this chapter for the
particular area in question.
119. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file in the office of the Village Clerk, where it can be
examined during regular office hours.

exceptional topography that it cannot be appropriately improved
without such modification.

change shall not become effective except by a favorable vote of all
the members of said Board.
