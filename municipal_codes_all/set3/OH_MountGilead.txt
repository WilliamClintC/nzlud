matter of codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for
some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council,
   NOW THEREFORE BE IT ORDAINED by the Council of the Village of Mount Gilead,
State of Ohio:

   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk of Council, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of Mount
Gilead, Ohio.
   SECTION 2.The provisions of the Codified Ordinances shall be in full force
and effect immediately upon passage of this Adopting Ordinance. All ordinances
and resolutions or parts thereof, enacted prior to November 15, 1965, which are
inconsistent with any pro-vision of the Codified Ordinances, are hereby
repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
   (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and recodification.
   (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)   The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)   The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other

summary of new matter contained in the Codified Ordinances. All sections of the
Codified Ordinances, without a previous ordinance or resolution history at the
end thereof, indicate that the section contains new matter ordained by this
Adopting Ordinance. The Comparative Section Table lists by section number all
sections which contain new matter adopted by this Adopting Ordinance.
   SECTION 4.This ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health and safety
of the Village, and for the further reason that there exists an imperative
necessity for the earliest publication and distribution of the Codified
Ordinances to the officials and citizens of the Village, so as to facilitate
administration, daily operation and avoid practical and legal entanglements,
wherefore, this ordinance shall be in full force and effect from and
immediately after its passage and approval by the Mayor.

PRELIMINARY UNIT
EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinancewhich enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.

portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the Village for

the tax in the same proportion as the average ratio of:

of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.

an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be
substituted by the Village Treasurer so as to produce such result.
   (c)    As used in this chapter, "sales made in the Village" means:
      (1)    All.sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within

      (3)    All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where

activity differs form the calendar year, the tax shall be applied to that part
of the net profits for the fiscal year as shall be earned on and after January
1, 2004, to the close of the taxpayer's fiscal year. Thereafter, the taxpayer
shall report on its fiscal year basis.
   Where the fiscal year of a business, profession or other activity is other
than a calendar year, in computing initial tax the profits of such taxpayer
shall be determined by dividing the annual profits by twelve and multiplying
the quotient by the number of months within the period commencing January 1,
2004, and ending at the conclusion of such fiscal year.
(Ord. 661. Passed 12-21-64; Ord. 1513. Passed 3-15-04.)

return and pay to the Village Treasurer the amount of taxes so deducted. Such
employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and

   (b)   Each employer who maintains a place of business in the Village and
another branch within the metropolitan area of the Village must also withhold
the tax from employees residing in the Village but working at the employer's

employer from the salaries, wages, lottery winnings, prize moneys, commissions
or other compensation of any employee and paid by the employer to the Village
Treasurer.

   Those taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration on
or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
   Such declaration shall be filed upon a form furnished by or obtainable from
the Village Treasurer, provided, however, that credit shall be taken for the
Village tax to be withheld from any portion of such income. In accordance with
the provisions of Section 171. 07, credit may be taken for tax to be paid to or
to be withheld and remitted to another taxing municipality.
   The original declaration, or any subsequent amendment thereof, may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided for herein.
   Such declarations of estimated tax to be paid to the Village shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated annual tax,
and at least a similar amount shall be paid on or before the fifteenth day of

However, in case an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance

enforcement of the provisions of this chapter and he is hereby empowered to
adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any matter or
thing pertaining to the administration and enforcement of the provisions of

taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so determined, together

signed by Governor Kasich on December 19, 2014, and H.B. 5 required municipal
corporations to conform to and adopt the provisions of Ohio R.C. Chapter 718 in

   (a)   Collection at Source; Withholding from Qualifying Wages.
      (1)   A.   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality’s income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
172.05(b) of this chapter or division (a)(4) or (a)(6) of this section.  An
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the
tax from qualifying wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer
directly, indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or
credits the qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
         B.   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division
(a)(1)A. of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may
also deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the
municipal corporation in which the employee is a resident.
      (2)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (a)(2)B. or (a)(2)C. of this section of taxes
required to be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax
Administrator not later than the last day of the month following the last day
of each calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399.00), or if the total amount
of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on
behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter
exceeded two hundred dollars ($200.00).  Payment under division (a)(2)B. of
this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than 15 days
after the last day of each month.
         C.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld may be remitted
semimonthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld
or required to be deducted on behalf of the Municipality in the preceding
calendar year exceeded eleven thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if
the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and
withheld on behalf of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar
year exceeded one thousand dollars ($1,000.00). The payment under division (a)
(2)C. of this section shall be made to the Tax Administrator not later than one
of the following:
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee’s employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
172.09(a) of this chapter.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual’s disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation’s
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer’s, agent’s, or other
payer’s exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from
whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee’s qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal

and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section.  The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer’s or employee’s liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income
tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer’s employees and
constituting qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities
are under the employer’s control.  For the purposes of this division, a tip or
gratuity is under the employer’s control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the
customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the
customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other
electronic means.
      (11)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer
at the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee’s
qualifying wages subject to division (b)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations.  The allocation shall be made using any fair
and reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation.  A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee’s “principal place of work” with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division
(b)(2)B. of this section, except that “location” shall be substituted for

               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than 20 days of actual services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than 20 days.

requested that the employer withhold tax from the employee’s qualifying wages
as provided in Section
172.05(a) of this chapter.

entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee’s capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
         B.   For the purposes of division (b)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a
municipal corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services
for or on behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any
other municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the
amount of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent
performing one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have
been spent at the employee’s principal place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee’s employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (b)
(2)B.3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the
employee does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate
owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee’s employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee’s final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee’s
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)
(2)A. of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee’s
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee’s principal place of work is located.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the 20-day threshold
described in division (b)(2)A. of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (b)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax
for that municipal corporation for the first 20 days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
         C.   If an employer makes the election described in division (b)(4)B.
of this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first 20 days to the municipal corporation in which the employee’s principal
place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
      (5)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee’s qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer’s fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
172.03 of this chapter.  To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer’s Federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (a)(2)A. and (a)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
172.05(a) of this chapter.
   (c)   Collection at Source; Casino and VLT.
      (1)   The Municipality shall require a casino facility or a casino
operator, as defined in Section 6(C)(9) of Article XV, Ohio Constitution, and
Ohio R.C. 3772.01, respectively, or a lottery sales agent conducting video
lottery terminals sales on behalf of the State to withhold and remit municipal
income tax with respect to amounts other than qualifying wages as provided in
this section.
      (2)   If a person’s winnings at a casino facility are an amount for which
reporting to the internal revenue service of the amount is required by section
6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the casino operator shall deduct
and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s winnings at the rate of the
tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the casino facility is
located.
      (3)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a casino operator are held in
trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is owed.
         A.   On or before the tenth day of each month, the casino operator
shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, providing the name, address, and Social Security number of the
person from whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of
each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the winnings from which each such amount was withheld, the type of
casino gaming that resulted in such winnings, and any other information
required by the Tax Administrator.  With this return, the casino operator shall
remit electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld
during the preceding month.
         B.   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall file
an annual return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the municipal
corporation in which the casino facility is located, indicating the total
amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.  The casino
operator shall remit electronically with the annual return any amount that was
deducted and withheld and that was not previously remitted.  If the name,
address, or Social Security number of a person or the amount deducted and
withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a monthly return for that
reporting period, that information shall be indicated on the annual return.
         C.   Annually, on or before January 31, a casino operator shall issue
an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount has been
deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.  The information
return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted from the
person’s winnings during the preceding year.  The casino operator shall provide
to the Tax Administrator a copy of each information return issued under this
division.  The administrator may require that such copies be transmitted
electronically.
         D.   A casino operator that fails to file a return and remit the
amounts deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount
withheld and not remitted.  Such personal liability extends to any penalty and
interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
         E.   If a casino operator sells the casino facility or otherwise quits
the casino business, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties
and interest thereon are immediately due and payable.  The successor shall
withhold an amount of the purchase money that is sufficient to cover the
amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and interest thereon
until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
            1.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
            2.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
            If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
         F.   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person’s winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
      (4)   If a person’s prize award from a video lottery terminal is an
amount for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by
section 6041 of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales
agent shall deduct and withhold municipal income tax from the person’s prize
award at the rate of the tax imposed by the municipal corporation in which the
video lottery terminal facility is located.
      (5)   Amounts deducted and withheld by a video lottery sales agent are
held in trust for the benefit of the municipal corporation to which the tax is
owed.
         A.   The video lottery sales agent shall issue to a person from whose
prize award an amount has been deducted and withheld a receipt for the amount
deducted and withheld, and shall obtain from the person receiving a prize award
the person’s name, address, and Social Security number in order to facilitate
the preparation of returns required by this section.
         B.   On or before the tenth day of each month, the video lottery sales
agent shall file a return electronically with the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality providing the names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of the
persons from whose prize awards amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount
of each such deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the
amount of the prize award from which each such amount was withheld, and any
other information required by the Tax Administrator.  With the return, the
video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator
all amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
         C.   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all
receipts issued under division (c)(5) of this section and shall make those
records available to the Tax Administrator upon request.  Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with Ohio R.C. 5747.17 and any rules adopted pursuant
thereto.
         D.   Annually, on or before January 31, each video lottery terminal
sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with the Tax
Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is located
indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar
year.  The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with the annual
return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not previously
remitted.  If the name, address, or Social Security number of a person or the
amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was omitted on a
monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall be indicated
on the annual return.
         E.   Annually, on or before January 31, a video lottery sales agent
shall issue an information return to each person with respect to whom an amount
has been deducted and withheld during the preceding calendar year.  The
information return shall show the total amount of municipal income tax deducted
and withheld from the person’s prize award by the video lottery sales agent
during the preceding year.  A video lottery sales agent shall provide to the
Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of each information
return issued under this division.  The Tax Administrator may require that such
copies be transmitted electronically.
         F.   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit
the amounts deducted and withheld is personally liable for the amount deducted
and withheld and not remitted.  Such personal liability extends to any penalty
and interest imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax
deducted and withheld.
      (6)   If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable.  The successor of the video
lottery sales agent that purchases the video lottery terminals from the agent
shall withhold an amount from the purchase money that is sufficient to cover
the amounts deducted and withheld and any penalties and interest thereon until
the predecessor video lottery sales agent operator produces either of the
following:
         A.   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         B.   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
         If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
      (7)   The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold
the required amount from a person’s prize award does not relieve that person
from liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
      (8)   If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may impose the following applicable
penalty:
         A.   For the late remittance of, or failure to remit, tax deducted and
withheld under this section, a penalty equal to 50% of the tax deducted and
withheld;
         B.   For the failure to file, or the late filing of, a monthly or
annual return, a penalty of five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each return not
filed or filed late.  Interest shall accrue on past due amounts deducted and
withheld at the rate prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5703.47.
      (9)   Amounts deducted and withheld on behalf of a municipal corporation
shall be allowed as a credit against payment of the tax imposed by the
municipal corporation and shall be treated as taxes paid for purposes of
Section
172.07 of this chapter.  This division applies only to the person for whom the
amount is deducted and withheld.
      (10)   The Tax Administrator shall prescribe the forms of the receipts
and returns required under this section.

172.06  INCOME SUBJECT TO NET PROFIT TAX.
   (a)   Determining Municipal Taxable Income for Taxpayers Who Are Not
Individuals.  “Municipal Taxable Income” for a taxpayer who is not an
individual for the Municipality is calculated as follows:
   “Income” reduced by “Exempt Income” to the extent otherwise included in
income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any “Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward” equals “Municipal Taxable Income”.
      (1)   “Income” for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the “Net
Profit” of the taxpayer.
         A.   “Net Profit” for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
172.03(c)(23).
         B.   “Adjusted Federal Taxable Income” is defined in Section
172.03(c)(1) of this chapter.
      (2)   “Exempt Income” is defined in Section
172.03(c)(11) of this chapter.
      (3)   “Apportionment” means the apportionment as determined by Section
172.06(b) of this chapter.
      (4)   “Pre-2017 Net Operating Loss Carryforward” is defined in Section
172.03(c)(32) of this chapter.
   (b)   Net Profit; Income Subject to Net Profit Tax; Alternative
Apportionment.  This section applies to any taxpayer engaged in a business or
profession in the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides
in the Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company,
or telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Ohio
R.C. Chapter 5745.
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Municipality for purposes of municipal income taxation in
the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
         A.   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
            As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,
wherever the individual’s services are performed, excluding compensation from
which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
172.05(b) of this chapter;
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (b)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer’s business
activity in the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax
Administrator of the Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with
respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return.  The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
172.19(a) of this chapter.
         C.   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(2)A. of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
172.19(a) of this chapter.
         D.   Nothing in division (b)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (b)(1)B. of this section, “wages, salaries, and
other compensation” includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid
to an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:
         A.   A location that is owned, controlled, or used by, rented to, or
under the possession of one of the following:
            1.   The employer;
            2.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of the employer, or a
related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
            3.   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described
in division (b)(3)A.2. of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
         B.   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee’s presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (b)(3)A. or (b)(3)B. of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer’s municipal income tax
liability.  If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator’s determination was unreasonable.
      (4)   For the purposes of division (b)(1)C. of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:
         A.   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall
be sitused to the municipal corporation in which the sale originated.  For the
purposes of this division, a sale of property originates in a municipal
corporation if, regardless of where title passes, the property meets any of the
following criteria:
            1.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
            2.   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation
from a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
            3.   The property is shipped from a place within the municipal
corporation to purchasers outside the municipal corporation, provided that the
taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly engaged in the
solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery is made.
         B.   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
         C.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
         D.   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
         E.   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal
corporation in which the property generating the net profit is located and the
municipal corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net
profit resides.
         A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use
separate accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under
this division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(6)B. of this section,
commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating to the sale,
purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the municipal corporation
in which the real estate is located.  Net profit reported by the real estate
agent or broker shall be allocated to a municipal corporation based upon the
ratio of the commissions the agent or broker received from the sale, purchase,
or lease of real estate located in the municipal corporation to the commissions
received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate everywhere in the
taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a municipal income tax shall report the individual’s net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual’s annual tax return for that
municipal corporation.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
172.08(a) of this chapter.
      (7)   If, in computing a taxpayer’s adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee’s
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
172.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4. of this chapter, by a municipal corporation to
which the taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit, the taxpayer
shall add the amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer’s net profit
that was apportioned to that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a
taxpayer be required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that
municipal corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee
would be required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not
exempted from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer’s net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.
      (8)   When calculating the ratios described in division (b)(1) of this
section for the purposes of that division or division (b)(2) of this section,
the owner of a disregarded entity shall include in the owner’s ratios the
property, payroll, and gross receipts of such disregarded entity.
   (c)   Consolidated Federal Income Tax Return.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         A.   “Affiliated group of corporations” means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a
group includes at least one incumbent local exchange carrier that is primarily
engaged in the business of providing local exchange telephone service in this
State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
         B.   “Consolidated Federal income tax return” means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
         C.   “Consolidated Federal taxable income” means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions.  “Consolidated
Federal taxable income” does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (c)
(1)A. of this section.
         D.   “Incumbent local exchange carrier” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 4927.01.
         E.   “Local exchange telephone service” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 5727.01.
      (2)   A.   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the municipal
income tax in that taxable year and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year.
            1.   The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with
the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting
method is required under Federal law.
            2.   The election continues to be binding for each subsequent five-
year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing consolidated
municipal income tax returns under division (c)(2)B. of this section; or
            3.   A taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. 
The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
         B.   An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (c)(2)A. of this section.  The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
         C.   An election made under division (c)(2)A. or B. of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for that taxable year if the
Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm’s length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the municipal corporation.  A taxpayer that is
required to file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated municipal income tax return for all subsequent
taxable years unless the taxpayer requests and receives written permission from
the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer has experienced a
change in circumstances.
      (4)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated municipal income tax return
in the same manner as is required under the United States Department of
Treasury regulations that prescribe procedures for the preparation of the
consolidated Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common
parent of the affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (c)(5)B., C., and D.
of this section, corporations that file a consolidated municipal income tax
return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
172.03(c)(1) of this chapter, by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable
income” for “Federal taxable income” wherever “Federal taxable income” appears
in that division and by substituting “an affiliated group of corporation’s” for
“a C corporation’s” wherever “a C corporation’s” appears in that division.
         B.   No corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
172.03(c)(1) of this chapter to the extent that the item of income or deduction
otherwise subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
         C.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, the
corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity’s net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
            1.   Exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.06(b) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation.  If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
excluded, the entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the
basis of the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
            2.   Include the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
172.06(b) of this chapter, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation.  If the entity’s net profit or loss is so
included, the entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on
the basis of the entity’s net profits that are included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         D.   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than 80% of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled, directly
or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in that
affiliated group’s consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year, all
of the following shall apply:
            1.   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity’s net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
172.06(b) of this chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group’s net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
            2.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity’s net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
      (6)   Corporations filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
shall make the computations required under Section
172.06(b) of this chapter by substituting “consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to” for “net profit from” wherever “net profit from” appears in
that section and by substituting “affiliated group of corporations” for
“taxpayer” wherever “taxpayer” appears in that section.
      (7)   Each corporation filing a consolidated municipal income tax return
is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by a municipal corporation in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
      (8)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with a municipal corporation before January 1, 2016, to file
a consolidated or combined tax return with such municipal corporation may
continue to file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such
election or agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.
   (d)   Tax Credit for Businesses That Foster New Jobs in Ohio.  The
Municipality, by ordinance, may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit
against its tax on income to a taxpayer to foster job creation in the
Municipality.  If a credit is granted under this division, it shall be measured
as a percentage of the new income tax revenue the Municipality derives from new
employees of the taxpayer and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years. 
Before the Municipality passes an ordinance granting a credit, the Municipality
and the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of
the credit.
   (e)   Tax Credits to Foster Job Retention.  The Municipality, by ordinance,
may grant a refundable or nonrefundable credit against its tax on income to a
taxpayer for the purpose of fostering job retention in the Municipality.  If a
credit is granted under this division, it shall be measured as a percentage of
the income tax revenue the Municipality derives from the retained employees of
the taxpayer, and shall be for a term not exceeding 15 years.  Before the
Municipality passes an ordinance allowing such a credit, the Municipality and
the taxpayer shall enter into an agreement specifying all the conditions of the
credit.

         A.   Taxes withheld from qualifying wages shall be considered as paid
to the municipal corporation for which the taxes were withheld in equal amounts
on each payment date.  If the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all
amounts were actually withheld, the amounts withheld shall be considered as

172.09(a) of this chapter.
         (a)   For taxpayers who are individuals, or who are not individuals
and are reporting and filing on a calendar year basis, the annual tax return is
due on the same date as the filing of the Federal tax return, unless extended
pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G).
         (b)   For taxpayers who are not individuals, and are reporting and
filing on a fiscal year basis or any period other than a calendar year, the
annual return is due on the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end
of the taxable year or period.
      (4)   An amended declaration is required whenever the taxpayer’s
estimated tax liability changes during the taxable year.  A change in estimated
tax liability may either increase or decrease the estimated tax liability for
the taxable year.
   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this chapter upon the amount of underpayment for the period of
underpayment, unless the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described
in division (e) of this section.  The amount of the underpayment shall be
determined as follows:
         A.   For the first payment of estimated taxes each year, 22.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         B.   For the second payment of estimated taxes each year, 45% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         C.   For the third payment of estimated taxes each year, 67.5% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment;
         D.   For the fourth payment of estimated taxes each year, 90% of the
tax liability, less the amount of taxes paid by the date prescribed for that
payment.
      (2)   The period of the underpayment shall run from the day the estimated
payment was required to be made to the date on which the payment is made.  For
purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 90% of
the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by annualizing the
income received during the year up to the end of the month immediately
preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100%
of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the preceding
taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year reflected a
period of 12 months and the taxpayer filed a return with the municipal
corporation under Section
172.09(a) of this chapter for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Municipality but
was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that
includes the first day of the taxable year.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may waive the requirement for filing a declaration
of estimated taxes for any class of taxpayers after finding that the waiver is
reasonable and proper in view of administrative costs and other factors.
(Ord. 1730. Passed 12-7-15.)

172.08  CREDIT FOR TAX PAID.
   (a)   Taxes Paid to Other Municipalities.  The Municipality does not give a
credit for taxes paid to other municipalities.
   (b)   Refundable Credit for Qualifying Loss.
      (1)   As used in this section:
         A.   “Nonqualified deferred compensation plan” means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (b)(1)B.2. of this section,
“qualifying loss” means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer’s receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
            2.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid
to one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount
of compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the “qualifying loss” is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (b)(1)B.1. of this
section computed without regard to division (b)(1)B.2. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
            3.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   “Qualifying tax rate” means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal
corporation with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.  If different tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the
“qualifying tax rate” is a weighted average of those different tax rates.  The
weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation
each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (b)(4) of this section, a
refundable credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a
municipal corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during
the taxable year.  The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of
the qualifying loss and the qualifying tax rate.
         B.   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
         C.   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation’s proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
         D.   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   A.   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         B.   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer’s qualifying loss is attributable to:
         A.   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
         B.   The employee’s failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer’s terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
   (c)   Credit for Person Working in Joint Economic Development District or
Zone.  A Municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a
resident of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone
created under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district
created under Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it
grants a credit against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in
another municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
172.08(a) of this chapter.
   (d)   Credit for Tax Beyond Statute for Obtaining Refund.
      (1)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
172.09(f) of this chapter.
      (2)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
172.09(f), the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due.  If the Municipality’s tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
      (3)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
172.09(f) of this chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in this section requires a Municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the Municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation.  Section
172.08(a) of this chapter regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 1730. Passed 12-7-15.)

172.09  ANNUAL RETURN.
   (a)   Return and Payment of Tax.
      (1)   A.   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
municipal taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section
172.05(a)(3) of this chapter when the nonresident individual taxpayer’s sole
income subject to the tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer, and no additional tax is due to the
Municipality.
         C.   All resident individual taxpayers, 18 years of age and older,
shall file an annual municipal income tax return with the Municipality,
regardless of income or liability.
      (2)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent’s executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
      (3)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or
notice required of that individual shall be completed and filed by the
individual’s duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. 
Such duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer. 
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
      (4)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be
completed and filed by the fiduciary of the estate or trust.  Such fiduciary
shall provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to
support that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the
taxpayer.  This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and
contact information including name, address, and phone number of the fiduciary.
      (5)   No municipal corporation shall deny spouses the ability to file a
joint return.
      (6)   A.   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer’s duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer’s Social Security number or taxpayer identification number.  Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
         B.   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer’s Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, “Wage and Tax Statements,” including all information
reported on the taxpayer’s Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service
form 1040 or, in the case of a return or request required by a qualified
municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return.  An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
         C.   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer’s Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
         D.   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality.  The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016.  The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
         E.   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer’s
municipal income tax liability.  The requirements imposed under division (a)(6)
of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic
form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
         F.   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
      (7)   A.   1.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under Ohio
R.C. 5747.08(G).  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or notice on
forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms, together with
remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax Administrator.
            2.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax
Administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer’s taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
            3.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be
filed by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed
by a taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to
ensure the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and
make payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers
not otherwise required to file annual returns.
         C.   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
172.09(b) of this chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
172.09(b) of this chapter, the provision in Section
172.09(b) of this chapter prevails.
      (8)   A.   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (a)(8)A. of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under divisions (a)(6)C. and D. of
this section.
      (9)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
172.05(a)(2)B. or C. of this chapter.
         A.   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other Municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment. 
“The date of postmark” means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
         B.   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  For
purposes of this section, “submitted the payment” means the date which the
taxpayer has designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be
the same date as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
      (10)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the
agent of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
172.05(a) of this chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld.
      (11)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return. 
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer’s refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.  Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
      (12)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing
a generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality’s ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
      (13)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
      (14)   A.   As used in this division, “worksite location” has the same
meaning as in Section
172.05(b) of this chapter.
         B.   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the
municipal corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the
person performed services at a worksite location within the municipal
corporation, and the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and
remitted all applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this
chapter.  The Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a
taxpayer who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation’s
income tax for the taxable year.
                  The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit
that briefly explains the person’s circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit
also shall include the following statement:  “The affiant has no plans to
perform any services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the
municipal corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the
municipal corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year,
the affiant agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a
taxpayer with the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by
the municipal corporation’s resolutions, ordinances, or rules.”  The person
shall sign the affidavit under penalty of perjury.
            3.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (a)
(14)B. of this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to
file any tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (a)(14) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator
from performing an audit of the person.
   (b)   Return and Payment of Tax; Individuals Serving in Combat Zone.
      (1)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member’s or civilian’s
duty service and for 180 days thereafter.  The application shall be filed on or
before the one hundred eightieth day after the member’s or civilian’s duty
terminates.  An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant’s active duty or service terminates.  Except as provided in division
(b)(2)C. of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract
terms as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
         B.   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be
required to file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to
pay any tax otherwise due to the Municipality before the one hundred eighty-
first day after the applicant’s active duty or service terminates.
         C.   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent.  The Tax Administrator shall not
require any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes
for the extension period.
      (3)   A.   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in
this division the application of divisions (b)(1) and (2) of this section.
         B.   1.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter.  The length of any extension granted under division (b)
(3)B.1. of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding
extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code.  As used
in this section, “qualifying taxpayer” means a member of the national guard or
a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called
to active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
            2.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (b)(3)B.1. of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period.  Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date.  The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.  The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (b)(3)B.1. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
      (4)   For each taxable year to which division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2)B. and C. or
(b)(3) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if
the filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for
that year.
   (c)   Use of Ohio Business Gateway; Types of Filings Authorized.
      (1)   Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer’s net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
      (4)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law.  The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
      (5)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
   (d)   Extension of Time to File.
      (1)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for
a period other than six months for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended Federal income tax return.
      (3)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer’s Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer’s municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer’s requested extension.
      (4)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
      (5)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing State income tax returns under Ohio R.C. 5747.08(G), a taxpayer
shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income
tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be
the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
   (e)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   A.   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer’s annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
         B.   Within 60 days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer’s municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or
State tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         C.   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer’s consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
      (2)   A.   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon.  If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. 
Except as provided under division (e)(2)B. of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
172.19 of this chapter has not expired for a previously filed return.
         B.   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
      (3)   A.   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by Section
172.19(e) of this chapter for filing the amended return even if it is filed
beyond the period prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the
requirements of that division.  If the amount of the refund is ten dollars
($10.00) or less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. 
Except as set forth in division (e)(3)B. of this section, a request filed under
this division shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to
only those facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the
taxpayer’s annual return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by
the adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return unless it
is also filed within the time prescribed in Section
172.09(f) of this chapter.  Except as set forth in division (e)(3)B. of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer’s Federal or State income tax return.
         B.   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (f)   Refunds.
      (1)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of
the Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
         A.   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
         B.   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
      (2)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later.  Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer’s claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
         B.   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment.  Except as provided in division (f)
(2)C. of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied.  The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
         C.   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer’s originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
172.18 of this chapter.
      (3)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for
filing specified in division (f)(2) of this section shall be considered to have
been filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
         A.   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
         B.   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
         C.   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
      (4)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund.  For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return.  Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
172.10(a)(4) of this chapter.
      (5)   As used in this section, “withholding tax” has the same meaning as
in Section
172.10 of this chapter.

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
172.05(a) of this chapter.
   (b)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Compromise of Claim and Payment over
Time.
      (1)   As used in this section, “claim” means a claim for an amount
payable to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax
imposed in accordance with this chapter.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
         A.   Compromise a claim;
         B.   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator’s rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
      (4)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
      (5)   A.   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact.  Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
         B.   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
      (6)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide
detailed financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether
or not a payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer’s
failure to provide the necessary and required information by the Tax
Administrator shall preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
   (c)   Authority of Tax Administrator; Right to Examine.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof
may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax
returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that
the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter
for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return
was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter.  Upon written request
by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator’s
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer.  The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income.  The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person’s
possession or control.  The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination.  This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person’s Social Security number, Federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator.  A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within 30 days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
172.10 of this chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
172.99 of this chapter.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (d)(1) of this section
within 30 days after filing the next tax document requiring such identifying
information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
172.10 of this chapter.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (d)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
172.99 of this chapter for a violation of Section
172.15 of this chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax

   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
172.15 of this chapter.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (c) of this section;
      (2)   It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (f)   A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential.  In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) may not be appealed.

172.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail.  Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other Municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within 60
days after the receipt of service.  The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail.  For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person’s agent or the person’s affiliate
was conducting business at the address.  For the purposes of this section, a
person’s affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least 20%, as determined by voting rights, of
the addressee’s business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within 60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person.  Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.

172.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
         A.   The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be
domiciled in the Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider
membership from individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality.
         B.   Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment.  One member shall be appointed
by the top administrative official of the Municipality.  This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years.  There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority.  The board member appointed by the
top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion
of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.
718.11(A)(4).
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within 60 days of when the vacancy was created. 
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member’s predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term.  No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member’s
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer’s right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board.  The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within 60 days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within 60 days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of
this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives
a hearing.  If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law, certified
public accountant, or other representative.  The board may allow a hearing to
be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.  In such a case, the hearing
must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the hearing unless the
parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator’s
assessment or any part of that assessment.  The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within 90 days after the board’s final hearing on
the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to all
of the parties to the appeal within 15 days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board’s
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions.  The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator.  No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may
remove such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations,
or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings
shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be
present during the hearing.

172.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (a)   (1)   A.   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            1.   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            2.   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension. 
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, “qualifying deferral period” means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
172.18 of this chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of 25% or more of income required to be
reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after the commission
of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
172.09(f) of this chapter.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
172.18 of this chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant’s
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
172.09(f) of this chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(d) of this section.
   (e)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.

or operator may pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal
of the motor vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules
adopted under R.C. §4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.
However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal
corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall
give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the
towing service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not

      (2)   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give
the vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator. Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.

the record that pertains to a particular motor vehicle to any person who,
either in person or pursuant to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner
or operator of the motor vehicle and requests information pertaining to its
location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Sheriff’s or Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor
vehicle under division (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the

who identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests

storage pursuant to division (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both of
the following:

         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle, a certificate of registration for
the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
      (2)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor
vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
R.C. §4513.611.

(d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is ordered into
storage under division (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any personal items
from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and without paying any
fee. However, a towing service or storage facility may charge an after-hours
retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted
under R.C. §4921.25 if the owner retrieves the personal items after hours,
unless the towing service or storage facility fails to provide the notice
required under R.C. §4513.69(B)(3), if applicable. The owner of a motor vehicle
shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff or Chief of Police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner, unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
      (4)   For purposes of division (d)(3) of this section, “personal items”
do not include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (5)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
division (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for 30 days, the

zone, but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
         A.   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least 18 inches by 24 inches in size, that is visible from all
entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following information:
            1.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
            2.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.
If the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property
may include on the sign a statement that only tenants and guests may park in
the private tow- away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner. If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone. In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
            3.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times,
the times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
            4.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
            5.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in R.C. §4505.101(B).
            6.   In order to comply with the requirements of division (a)(1)A.
of this section, the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by
affixing to the existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the
sign.
         B.   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this division
(a) is taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with
all of the following:
            1.   It is located within 25 linear miles of the location of the
private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to a
place of storage within 25 linear miles.
            2.   It is well-lighted.
            3.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly
scheduled route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow- away zone is located.
      (2)   A.   If a vehicle is parked on private property that is established
as a private tow-away zone in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service. The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this division (a). The vehicle owner and
the operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C. §4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in R.C. §4505.101. The owner or lienholder of a vehicle
that has been removed under this division (a), subject to division (a)(3) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with division (a)(7) of
this section.
         B.   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to division (a)(2) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
         C.   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
      (3)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of division (a)(2) of this section arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to its actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under R.C.
§4921.25 in order to obtain release of the vehicle. That fee may be paid by use
of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction.
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator.
Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
      (4)   A.   Prior to towing a vehicle under division (a)(2) of this
section, a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many
photographs as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on
private property in violation of a private tow-away zone established under
division (a)(1) of this section. The towing service shall record the time and
date of the photographs taken under this division (h). The towing service shall

recovered by the owner or lienholder or at least two years after the date on
which the vehicle was towed, whichever is earlier.
         B.   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under division (a)
(2) of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more
than two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone,
unless the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two
hours due to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is
not within the power of the towing service.
      (5)   A.   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with division (a)(1) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under division
(a)(2) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of removing the
vehicle, shall provide notice to the Sheriff or the Police Department
concerning all of the following:
            1.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model, and color;
            2.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
            3.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
            4.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may
be recovered;
            5.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be

         B.   The Sheriff and Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any
vehicle removed from private property in the Sheriff’s or Police Chief’s
jurisdiction that is established as a private tow-away zone of which the
Sheriff or Police Chief has received notice under this division (a). The record
shall include all information submitted by the towing service. The Sheriff or
Police Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains to a
particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a telephone
call, identifies self as the owner, operator, or lienholder of the vehicle and
requests information pertaining to the vehicle.

service or storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause
a search to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain
the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle. The
Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall ensure that such information is provided in a
timely manner. Subject to division (a)(6)D. of this section, the towing service
or storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
            1.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor
Vehicles provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor
vehicle, if the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last
known address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by
a commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
            2.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed 30 days after the first

         B.   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to division (a)(6)A. of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or

possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under R.C.
§4505.101(B), may initiate the process for obtaining a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
         C.   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a
signed receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible,
shall not obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to
the motor vehicle under R.C. §4505.101(B).

request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all
photographs in the medium in which the photographs are stored, whether paper,
electronic, or otherwise.
         C.   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves
the vehicle, the towing service or storage facility in possession of the
vehicle shall give the owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the
motor vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action
under R.C. §4513.611.

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.

private property for more than 72 hours, or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking or upon
or within the right-of-way of any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer.
   (b)   Any motor vehicle abandoned in the manner provided herein is hereby
declared to be a public nuisance by reason of its abandonment causing a
deteriorating and blighting influence on nearby properties and by reason of its
depreciating the enjoyment and use of the properties in the immediate vicinity
to such an extent that it is harmful to the public health, welfare and safety
of the community in which such abandoned motor vehicle is located, and such
nuisance shall be abated.
   (c)   An abandoned motor vehicle is defined as any motor vehicle meeting all
of the following requirements:
      (1)   Left on private property for more than 72 hours other than in an
enclosed garage, on a public street or other property open to the public for
the purpose of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way

upon investigation, that a motor vehicle has been abandoned, he shall cause
written notice by certified mail or by personal service to be served upon the
owner, or the lessee, agent or tenant, having the right to possession of such
real property on which the abandoned motor vehicle must be removed within 72
hours after the service of such notice. If such owner or other person having
the right to possession of such real property is a nonresident whose address is
known, such service shall be sent to his address by certified mail.
   (e)   Upon failure of any owner, lessee, agent or tenant having charge of
the lots and lands referred to in division (d) hereof to comply with the notice
of removal within the period of time stipulated, the Chief of Police shall
cause such abandoned vehicle to be removed by the direct employment of labor or
authorize some person to remove the abandoned vehicle on behalf of the
municipality. The Chief of Police shall order any abandoned junk motor vehicle
to be photographed by a law enforcement officer in the place where abandoned.
The officer shall record the make of the motor vehicle, the serial number when
available, and shall also detail the damage or missing equipment to
substantiate the value of five hundred dollars ($500.00) or less. The Chief of
Police shall thereupon immediately dispose of the abandoned junk motor vehicle
to a junkyard or scrap metal processing facility as defined in Ohio R.C.
4747.05 or to any other facility owned by or under contract with the 
Municipality for the disposal of such motor vehicles. The records and

a one year period is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

   (a)   (1)   For purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any
motor vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63 (B) to (E)  that is
left uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours
with the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12,
or regulated under authority of a political subdivision; or if the property on
which the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by
any governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the
possession of the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a
bona fide commercial operation; or if the motor vehicle is a collector's
vehicle.
      (2)   No political subdivision shall prevent a person from storing or
keeping, or restrict a person in the method of storing or keeping, any
collector's vehicle on private property with the permission of the person
having the right to the possession of the property; except that a political
subdivision may require a person having such permission to conceal, by means of
buildings, fences, vegetation, terrain, or other suitable obstruction, any
unlicensed collector's vehicle stored in the open.
      (3)   The Chief of Police, Council, Board of Township Trustees or the
Municipal or Township Zoning Authority, may send notice, by certified mail with
return receipt requested, to the person having the right to the possession of
the property on which a junk motor vehicle is left, that within ten days of
receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle either shall be covered by being
housed in a garage or other suitable structure, or shall be removed from the
property.
      (4)   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in
the open for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this
section. The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence
of willful failure to comply with the notice, and each subsequent period of
thirty days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a
separate offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

amount of the fine established for the violation and pays the additional fine
of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.

are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn

from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,

indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A Steady Downward Green Arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A Steady Yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.

“don't walk,” or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

opposite direction or any traffic overtaken.  In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet

that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion,  the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.  The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, "Emergency medical
technician-intermediate" and "Emergency medical technician-paramedic" have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense.  If the person was under
arrest other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to
the person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, "National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration" means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains. The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;

analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.

      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b)  or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,  the person submits to the test
or tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately.  A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   If a person arrested for operating a vehicle in violation of
division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), or any other
municipal OVI ordinance, or for being in physical control of a vehicle in
violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the persons' arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.
(ORC 4511.191(D))
   (h)   Penalty for Driving Under the Influence.

(1)I. or (a)(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them. Whoever
violates division (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle
while under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed

section, or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the penalties and
sanctions provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) to (v).
         C.   Except as otherwise provided in division (h)(1)E. of this

prosecuted under appropriate State law.
         E.   An offender who previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) that was a felony, regardless of
when the violation and the conviction or guilty plea occurred, is guilty of a
felony to be prosecuted under appropriate State law.
      (2)   An offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation of
division (a) of this section and who subsequently seeks reinstatement of the
driver's or occupational driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege suspended under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 as a result of the
conviction or guilty plea shall pay a reinstatement fee as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.191(F)(2).
      (3)   A.   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under Ohio R.C.
4511.19(G)(1)(b)(i) or (ii) or (G)(1)(c)(i) or (ii) and if, within 60 days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the 60-day period following the date of sentencing, the court may
impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that
includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous
alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(1), the court may sentence the offender as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(3).
      (4)   If an offender's driver's or occupational driver's license or
permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended under division (h) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G) and if Ohio R.C. 4510.13 permits the court
to grant limited driving privileges, the court may grant the limited driving

must display on the vehicle that is driven subject to the privileges restricted
license plates that are issued under Ohio R.C. 4503.231, except as provided in
division (B) of that section, the court shall impose that condition as one of
the conditions of the limited driving privileges granted to the offender,
except as provided in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (5)   Fines imposed under this section for a violation of division (a) of
this section shall be distributed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(5).
      (6)   If title to a motor vehicle that is subject to an order of criminal
forfeiture under division (h)(1)C., D., or E. of this section is assigned or
transferred and Ohio R.C.  4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, in addition to or
independent of any other penalty established by law, the court may fine the
offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of the National
Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so imposed shall be
distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide
that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, may order restitution pursuant to §
501.99(f) or R.C. § 2929.18 or 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for
any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and
proximate result of the offender's operation of the vehicle before, during, or
after committing the offense for which the offender is sentenced under division
(h) of this section.
      (8)   A court may order an offender to reimburse a law enforcement agency

suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s license,
temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident operating
privilege from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(6). The court may
grant limited driving privileges relative to the suspension under R.C.
§§4510.021 and 4510.13. The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with
an ignition interlock device relative to the suspension and may reduce the
period of suspension as authorized under R.C. §4510.022. If the court grants
unlimited driving privileges under R.C. §4510.022, the court shall suspend any
jail term imposed under division (i)(1) of this section as required under that
section.
      (2)   If, within one year of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one or more violations of division (a)
or (b) of this section or other equivalent offense or offenses, the offender is

that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to §
501.99(f) or R.C. § 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding $5,000 for any economic
loss arising from an accident or collision that was the direct and proximate
result of the offender's operation of the vehicle before, during, or after
committing the violation of division (b) of this section.

Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services.
      (2)   An offender who stays in a drivers' intervention program or in an
alcohol treatment program under an order issued under this section shall pay
the cost of the stay in the program. However, if the court determines that an
offender who stays in an alcohol treatment program under an order issued under
this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's indigent drivers' alcohol
treatment fund.
   (k)   If a person whose driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or Ohio R.C.
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.
   (l)   Division (a)(1)J. of this section does not apply to a person who
operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person’s
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or exceeds the amount
specified in that division, if both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
      (2)   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled substance
in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (m)   The prohibited concentrations of a controlled substance or a
metabolite of a controlled substance listed in division (a)(1)J. of this
section also apply in a prosecution of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.16(D) in
the same manner as if the offender is being prosecuted for a prohibited
concentration of alcohol.
   (n)   All terms defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 apply to this section. If the
meaning of a term defined in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 conflicts with the meaning of
the same term as defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01 or 4511.01, the term as defined
in Ohio R.C. 4510.01 applies to this section.
(ORC 4511.19(G) - (M))
   (o)   Physical Control of Vehicle While Under the Influence.
      (1)   Definition. As used in this division, “physical control”  means
being in the driver's position of the front seat of a vehicle and having
possession of the vehicle's ignition key or other ignition device.
      (2)   Generally.  No person shall be in physical control of a vehicle if,
at the time of the physical control, any of the following apply:
         A.   The person is under the influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or
a combination of them.
         B.   The person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
contains at least the concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B.,

a controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or
urine that equals or exceeds the concentration specified in division (a)(1)J.
of this section.
      (3)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of this section, if a law enforcement officer has administered a
field sobriety test to the person in physical control of the vehicle involved
in the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally acceptable field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect what were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field

during recess and opening and closing hours, whenever the distance, as measured
in a straight line, from the school property line nearest the crosswalk to the
nearest point of a crosswalk is no more than 1,320 feet. Such a school zone

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about

the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar shall
accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration of any
motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in R.C. § 4509.01. If the offender fails to provide

prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial driver's
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of

prima facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid
driver's or commercial driver's license issued by this state or any other

operator, either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver's or commercial
driver's license or in the form of a restricted license, except as otherwise
provided in this division, the offense is an unclassified misdemeanor. When the

to §
501.99(e)(3) or R.C. § 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up to
500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service
imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under R.C. §
2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender previously
has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of this section or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of
the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation, or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose

otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat, or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation, or summons issued for violating this section.

shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a

occurred at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed
to be a single violation of this section.

section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars
($75.00).
         B.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor, or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.

section.
      (2)   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a permit
under division (a)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect to
highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good cause
shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through

issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and

shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or

   (d)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling permit
under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of the

permit specified in division (a)(2) of this section.  If a permit is to be
issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.

351.17  SNOW REMOVAL ROUTES.
   (a)   An accumulation of two or more inches of snow on Village streets is
generally cause for the Village Street Department to begin snow plowing
operations to clear streets to ensure safe travel by motorists. Motor vehicles
parked on public streets present a hazard and difficulty to snowplow operators
and other vehicles using these streets. Therefore, it shall be unlawful for the
owner/operator of any motor vehicle to park or to allow to remain parked such
vehicle on certain Village streets as named in the Traffic Control Map when two
or more inches of snow have fallen and plowing operations have commenced.
      (1)   In the event that vehicles remain parked on restricted streets and
public ways after the accumulation of two or more inches of snow and plowing
operations have commenced, the Village Police Department may ticket such
vehicles for violation of this Ordinance. Whoever violates the provisions of
this Section shall be guilty of a parking violation and shall be issued a
parking ticket in accordance with Section
351.16 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Mount Gilead and such
vehicles may be removed at the expense of the owner.
      (2)   The Mayor or Village Administrator shall determine the extent of
snow and/or ice accumulation and so advise the Village Services Coordinator
when the accumulation has reached the depth of two (2) inches or more.
      (3)   The Village Administrator shall cause the proper and adequate signs
to be placed giving notice of such snow and ice removal routes upon the public
streets and public ways as set forth in the Traffic Control Map. Such signs
shall be considered permanently installed.
   (b)   When severe winter weather conditions result in the accumulation of
several inches of snow, or significant snowfall combined with high winds which
result in blowing and drifting snow, or other severe winter weather conditions
which result in a deterioration in driving conditions, and it becomes necessary
for the Village to take action to clear Village streets of snow in order to
provide for safe travel by the public, the Mayor or the Administrator may
declare that a Snow Emergency exists in the Village.
      (1)   When the Mayor or Administrator has declared that a Snow Emergency
exists, it is important that the Village Street Department clear all public
streets of accumulation of snow to allow for necessary travel and access by
emergency vehicles. To allow snow removal operations to proceed as efficiently
and safely as possible, it is necessary to remove all vehicles parked on the
Village streets or roads so that these streets may be cleared curb to curb.
Therefore, when a Snow Emergency has been declared it shall be unlawful for the
owner/operator of any  motor vehicle to park or permit to remain parked any
vehicle on any street within this Village.
      (2)   In the event that vehicles remain on the streets after the
declaration of a Snow Emergency, creating a hazard and an obstacle for snow
removal operations, the Police Department may arrange for the removal and
storage of such motor vehicles, at the expense of the owner.
   (c)   The Village Services Coordinator shall be responsible for removal of
snow and/or ice from such public streets and public ways.

   (a)   A person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality;
      (2)   While in this Municipality, the person attempts to commit, or is
guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in another jurisdiction,
which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality and the

subsequent to the person’s entrance into the conspiracy. In any case in which a
person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the commission of, or
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as described in this
division, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in this
Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and for any resulting
offense that is committed or completed in the other jurisdiction;

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality;

   (b)   In homicide, the element referred to in division (a)(1) of this
section includes the act that causes death, the physical contact that causes

Virginia, whichever is applicable, or under federal law.
   (d)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the

jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (g)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (h)   For purposes of division (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person’s legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of Ohio
R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43
(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined
to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a developmental disability
or physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until
either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Culpability."  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   "Intoxication."  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   "Involuntary acts."  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   "Possession."  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offendor’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge, or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense, or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder, or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate State law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted.  In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
State law.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
   (f)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially similar municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent’s, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her

501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender’s behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender’s conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
533.14 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or division (b)(5) or (b)(6) of this
section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if
the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this
chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of the
following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court's own motion, the court, in
the court's sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
533.14 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or when a jail term is required by
law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a minor
misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court's own motion, the
court, in the court's sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.

   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a

misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   The court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d)(1)B. may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender’s sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender’s occupation or care
for the offender’s family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity's
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.

(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;

addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in

imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction

seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor.  A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.

this division, the victim, private provider, state, or political subdivision
may bring an action to do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2)  or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.

any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.

order that must be accorded full faith a credit by a court of this State or
that it is not entitled to full faith and credit under 18 U.S.C. 2265(c).
   (d)   In a prosecution for a violation of this section, it is not necessary
for the prosecution to prove that the protection order or consent agreement was
served on the defendant if the prosecution proves that the defendant was shown
the protection order or consent agreement or a copy of either or a judge,
magistrate, or law enforcement officer informed the defendant that a protection
order or consent agreement had been issued, and proves that the defendant
recklessly violated the terms of the order or agreement.
   (e)   As used in this section, “protection order issued by a court of
another State” means an injunction or another order issued by a criminal court
of another State for the purpose of preventing violent or threatening acts or
harassment against, contact or communication with, or physical proximity to
another person including a temporary order, and means an injunction or order of

protection.  The term does not include an order for support or for custody of a
child issued pursuant to the divorce and child custody laws of another State,
except to the extent that the order for support or for custody of a child is
entitled to full faith and credit under the laws of the United States.

museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort, or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property can be restored
substantially to its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is
the reasonable cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under division (a)(1) of this
section, and the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored
substantially to its former condition, the value of the property, in the case
of personal property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property
of like kind and quality, and in the case of real property or real property
fixtures, is the difference in the fair market value of the property
immediately before and immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2913.61.
   (c)   Prima facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Ohio

determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02,
2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or
2913.43 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of
violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or
complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense. The value of the property or services involved in the series of
offenses for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio R.C.
2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in all
offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14
(A), Ohio R.C. 2913.02, 2913.03, or 2913.04, Ohio R.C. 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2),
or Ohio R.C. 2913.31 or 2913.43, whether committed against one victim or more
than one victim, involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult,
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, 
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense.  If an offender is being tried for the commission of a
series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to
violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether
committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is
an active duty service member or spouse of an active duty service member
pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried
as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value
of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the value
as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and
services involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same

value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series.  Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section.  While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record, or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort, or money, is the amount which
would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment, and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
such property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (2) of this section, and the value of services, is the
fair market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry, or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry, or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check, or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token, or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping, or other services for which the rate is established
by law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing, or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

717.01  APPLICATION OF REGULATIONS.
   All provisions of this chapter shall apply to any heirs, executors or
assigns of any person, firm, association, corporation, applicant or permittee
as fully as such provisions apply to any person, firm, association,
corporation, applicant or permittee.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.02  INTENT; AUTHORITY OF COUNCIL.
   (a)    It is hereby expressly stated to be the intent of this chapter, in
addition to pre- scribing minimum standards to make a drilling as safe as
possible within the Village, to also cause drilling activities to be carried on
within the Village on as large an area as feasible and to have as many lots as
feasible unitized under one drilling permit. Council does not approve of the
drilling of one well per lot. Council is also aware of the great difficulty in
setting a rigid rule as to the area to be included in any one unit. Bearing in
mind that it is the intent of this section to have property unitized when
possible and to prevent the withholding of permission by the landowner to
unitize on one permit and to later request permission to drill on the same lot
or area, Council is hereby authorized in any proper case to require that
certain landowners be requested to join in a specific unit and, on failure to
do so, Council shall have full authority to refuse a drilling permit to such
landowner at a later date.
   (b)    Council is herewith given full authority to make such rulings as it
shall deem necessary to give full force and effect to the intent as expressed
in subsection (a) hereof. What is a proper case shall be within the discretion
of Council, and no determination shall serve as a precedent to any other case.
Each application for a permit shall rest solely upon its merits and the prudent
use of discretion by Council.
(Ord. 634. Passed 6-1-64.)
717.03  PERMIT REQUIRED.
   No person shall commence to drill a well for oil or gas within the corporate
limits of the Village until such time as such person has wholly complied with
all provisions of this chapter and permission has been granted by Council to
such person, by permit authorized by Council and signed by the Mayor and
Village Clerk.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.04  PERMIT APPLICATION AND FEE.
   Any person desiring to drill a well for oil or gas within the corporate
limits of the Village shall make application for a permit to the Village Clerk
by 5:00 p. m. of the Friday prior to any regular meeting of Council. All
requests for permits must be complete at that time. A fee of one thousand
dollars ($1, 000) shall be paid to the Clerk at the time such application is
filed. Such fee is for the purpose of defraying the expenses of administration
and enforcement of regulatory ordinances concerning drilling oil or gas wells
within the corporate limits of the Village and for defraying the expenses of
inspecting oil or gas well sites prior to and during drilling, during
production, and at the time the wells are pulled and plugged. No refund of any
part of a permit fee shall be made to any permit holder for a dry hole or for
failure to exercise the privilege to drill upon the site covered by such
permit.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.05  DISPOSITION OF FEES COLLECTED.
   Each dollar hereafter received for a permit to drill for oil or gas within
the Village shall be distributed in the following manner:
   (a)   Ten percent to the Enforcement and Inspection Fund.
   (b)   Fifteen percent to the Capital Improvements Fund.
   (c)   Twenty-five percent to the Street Department Fund.
   (d)   Fifty percent to the General Fund to be used to reimburse the service
and safety accounts.
(Ord. 650. Passed 9-10-64.)
717.06  DEPOSIT REQUIRED.
   Any person, at the time of application, shall deposit with the Village Clerk
the sum of two thousand dollars ($2, 000) to serve as a cash bond conditioned
upon compliance with this chapter until the time of completion of drilling,
plugging or abandonment of the subject well. Such bond shall not only be
conditioned upon compliance by the applicant, but also upon compliance with
this chapter by any assignee and owner of any permit granted here-under, or any
employee, contractor, subcontractor or other party performing services in
connection with any permit issued hereunder.
(Ord. 667. Passed 2-1-65.)
717.07  CONSENTS FROM OWNERS WITHIN 200 FEET.
   (a)   All applications for a permit to drill for oil or gas in the Village
shall be accompanied by consents in writing of the owners of fifty-one percent
or more of the front footage of real estate which is located within a radius of
200 feet from a proposed drilling site. The consents shall plainly state that
the persons whose signatures are affixed thereto do thereby give their consent
to the drilling of a well for oil or gas on the site as proposed in the
application for a drilling permit. However, if the proposed site for a well is
located a distance of 200 feet or more from any abutting property, then,
regardless of the use to which the abutting property may be put, the assenting
signatures herein provided for shall not be required. Measurement for
determination of the distance of the aforesaid 200 feet shall be made from the
exact center of the location at which it is contemplated the well shall be
drilled. If any portion of a lot or tract of real estate is less than 200 feet
from the center of the location where a well is to be drilled, such lot or
tract shall be considered abutting property within the meaning of this section.
   (b)   In the event that the owner of any property abutting a proposed well
site:
      (1)   Has leased his property for drilling for oil or gas, or-
      (2)   Has signed and filed an application for a permit to drill for oil
or gas on his property, or his lessee, contractor or agent has signed and filed
such application, or
      (3)   Has signed and delivered a written assent under this chapter to an
application for a permit to drill a well for oil or gas, or
   (4)   Has unitized his property by entering into a community lease or
agreement for drilling a well for oil or gas, and if the well to which he had
assented or which is to be drilled under such community lease or agreement is
to be located nearer to his property than the well or proposed well site first
above mentioned in this subsection, such owner shall not be permitted to object
but shall be deemed to have given his written assent under the provisions of
this chapter to drilling a well for oil or gas on the proposed well site first
mentioned above.
   However, any owner who has unitized his property by entering into a
community lease or agreement as set forth in subsection (b)(4) hereof shall not
share in any adjacent well production because of conflicting lease interests of
such real estate caused by such real estate being in more than one unitized
area. It is the express intention of this provision to prohibit an owner of
property from unitizing identical property under more than one community lease
or agreement.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.08  WAIVERS FROM OWNERS OR OCCUPANTS WITHIN 200 OR 100 FEET.
   (a)    No drilling shall be permitted for oil or gas wells within 200 feet
of any building or structure,of any nature unless written waivers as
hereinafter provided for accompany an application for a drilling permit.
   (b)   The owners or occupants of any buildings or structures which are
located within 200 feet of the proposed well site must waive in writing the
distance set forth. Such owners or occupants may waive down to a minimum
distance of one hundred feet without the necessityof vacating or causing to be
vacated any buildings or structures during drilling operations.
   (c)   The owners or occupants of any buildings or structures of any nature
may consent to drilling for oil or gas closer than one hundred feet to such
buildings or structures, but in such cases, Council shall consider special
features affecting the application for a drilling permit such as topographical
conditions, nature of occupancy and proximity of buildings on the abutting
property, facilities available at the Fire Department to cope with controlling
liquid fires and such other matters as Council shall deem relevant to the
application. ShouldCouncil, upon considering such special features, find that
an undue hazard is created, then irrespective of waivers being provided as
called for in this subsection, Council may refuse to issue a permit to drill.
The denial of the permit and the undue hazard created shall be recorded in the
minutes of Council by the Clerk.
   (d)   Where the owners or occupants of any buildings or structures which are
closer than 200 feet to a proposed drilling site have at any time waived in
writing the distance requirement provided in this section for any proposed
drilling site which was closer than 200 feet to such buildings or structures,
then such property owners shall be deemed to have waived the distance
requirement provided for in this section down to the same distancethat such
party waived for the other proposed drilling site or to the distance that a
well was actually drilled, whichever is smaller.
   (e)   Any owners or occupants of any buildings or structures who actually
reside within one hundred feet of a proposed drilling site are required to
vacate, cause to vacate and assure the continued vacation of such buildings or
structures during drilling operations. A written agreement must be provided
with the application for a drilling permit in such cases wherein the owners or
occupants agree to vacate, cause to vacate and to assure continued vacation of
any buildings or structures located closer than one hundred feet to a proposed
drilling site.
   (f)   All distances as set forth in this section shall be those distances as
measured from the exact center of a proposed drilling site.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.09  MAP REQUIRED.
   Each application for a drilling permit must be accompanied by a map of the
area involved in the application drawn to scale and showing thereon:
   (a)   The lot lines of all properties within 200 feet of the proposed well
site.
   (b)   The lot lines of all abutting properties.
   (c)   The location of all buildings and structures within 200 feet of the
proposed well site.
   (d)   The names of the owners of each property shown on the map.
   (e)   A circle drawn on the map at a radius of 200 feet from the proposed
well site.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.10  AFFIDAVIT OF COMPLIANCE OR EXCEPTIONS.
   An applicant for a permit shall be required to file with the application an
affidavit stating that the applicant has complied with all conditions of this
chapter or setting forth any exceptions thereto. Any false statement in such
affidavit shall be grounds to refuse to issue a permit to drill or shall be
grounds to revoke a permit already issued by Council. Revocation of a permit
under this section shall have the same effect as revocation of a permit under
Section 717. 17.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.11  EASEMENTS OR OPTIONS FOR PIPELINES AND STORAGE TANKS.
   An applicant shall submit with his application copies of easements or
options for easements for a pipeline where such pipeline will be crossing
private property, and shall also provide a copy of an agreement or option for a
location for storage tanks should there be a producing well.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.12  EXISTING APPLICATIONS AND PERMITS.
   All applications for permits on file on the date of passage of this chapter
(Ordinance623, passed March 2, 1964) shall be governed by the provisions of
this chapter. All permittees under permits issued prior to the date of passage
of this chapter (Ordinance 623, passed March 2, 1964) shall be governed by any
prior ordinances in effect at the time such permits were issued.
(Ord. 623. Passed 3-2-64.)
717.13  STATE PERMITS REQUIRED; EXCEPTIONS.
   Effective immediately, Council will consider applications for permits to
drill within the corporate limits only when the application file contains a
permit issued by the State Division of Mines dated March 10, 1964, or
thereafter. However, when an application is filed with Council alleging that a
State permit was issued prior to March 10, 1964, and that operations for the
drilling for a well on the tract covered by such permit were commenced prior to
March 10, 1964, on sufficient proof of commencement of operations prior to
March 10, 1964, being made to Council, then Council will consider such
application and,if it conforms to all other provisions of this chapter, such
permit will be issued.
   In the case of all Village permits not acted upon on or before March 16,
1964, it shall be necessary for any applicant who has a permit from the State
Division of Mines issued prior to March 10, 1964, to give notice in writing to
the Mayor prior to 4:00 p.m. on March 25, 1964, that he is on location and
drilling for a well in such manner as not to have caused him to forfeit his
State permit. Applications on which notice has been given to the Mayor shall be
acted upon at the regular meeting of Council on April 6, 1964. Thereafter, no
further applications for Village permits will be considered by Council, other
than those including a State permit issued by the Division of Mines and bearing
a date of March 10, 1964, or later.
(Ord. 625. Passed 3-16-64.)

   (a)    All owners of drilling permits issued under ordinance 614, passed
November 13, 1963, shall be notified in writing by the Village Clerk that they
are to file with him in writing, within thirty days after the date of the
written notice, the status of the permits issued to them. In the event that no
drilling operations have taken place under the permit which was issued or, in
the event that drilling operations did take place with the result being a dry
hole, then the sum of eighteen hundred dollars ($1, 800) shall be refunded to
such permitholders and such permits shall be cancelled.

charge shall not be imposed if the owner of the property concerned can show
that he or she, or his or her predecessor in title, paid, or is paying, a
special assessment for the construction of any of the water mains which provide
such service, or, at his or her own expense, constructed any of the water mains
which provide such service. This charge is exclusive of service line charges,
connection permits and capacity charges.  This section does not apply to owners
of lots in a properly developed subdivision whose water lines have been built
by a developer and dedicated for public usage.
   This section does not apply to owners of lots in a properly developed
subdivision whose water lines have been built by a developer and dedicated for
public usage.
   (c)   Water Main Extensions. The Village will provide water service to new
consumers when it is determined that the water main extension is feasible, both
economically and from an engineering point of view, and will not be detrimental
to the best interest of the Village, having given consideration to the overall
effect of the new water service on the total water system and to the long-term
plans and probable future growth of the water system of the Village.
   (d)   Charge for Water Main Extensions.
      (1)   Contract areas (outside the Village). All water main extensions in
areas having a contract with the Village for water service shall be installed
and paid for as specified in the contract.
      (2)   Non-contract areas (outside the Village).
         A.   All water main extensions in areas having no contract with the
Village for water service shall be installed and paid for by the developer, the
applicant or the political subdivision requesting such service, at no expense
to the Village, regardless of the size of the water main installed or the
length of extensions.
         B.   Specifications and standards of construction for all water main
extensions shall be approved by the Village Administrator.
         C.   1.   The size of all water mains shall be determined by the
Village Administrator and shall be large enough not only to serve the areas
under immediate consideration, but also to serve areas which are likely to be
developed and which should be served by the water main under consideration.
            2.   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Administrator, no
water main shall be smaller than eight inches nominal diameter.
         D.   All extensions of water mains shall include the installation of
all taps, service lines, valves and fire hydrants. The number and location of
fire hydrants shall be in accordance with the requirements set by the Village
and shall be installed and paid for by the developer, the applicant or the
political subdivision. The number and location of all taps, service lines and
valves shall be as required by the Village.
         E.   All water mains and appurtenances shall be owned, operated and
maintained by the Village with title to be vested in the Village upon
completion of the water main.
      (3)   Within the Village.
         A.   All water main extensions in the Village shall be paid for by the
developer or applicant requesting such extension. Where the Village requires
the installation of a water main extension larger than eight inches in nominal
diameter, the Village shall pay the difference in the cost of the pipes,
fittings and valves between the installation of such eight-inch water main and
the water main installed.
         B.   The Village Administrator shall determine from the records, or
other sources, the cost of the pipes, fittings and valves, and this
determination shall be final.
         C.   The Village Administrator may make recommendations to Council for
water main extensions to be installed by a qualified developer, and the Village
Administrator will make a recommendation to Council, whether the water main
shall be installed by the Village or by the developer or applicant.
         D.   For each water main extension requested and installed by the
Village, the Village Administrator shall make an estimate of the total cost
involved, and the developer or applicant shall make a deposit to the Village
that is sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the extension. If the actual
cost of the extension is higher or lower than the deposit, the developer or
applicant will be refunded the amount of any excess deposit or shall pay to the
Village any deficit that may exist in the deposit, as the case may be.
         E.   When water main extensions are installed by the Village, the cost
may be assessed against the abutting property owners, with the approval of
Council. Such assessment shall be an amount equal to the total installation
cost, unless the line is required by the Village to be larger than eight
inches. When the Village requires the installation of a water main larger than
eight inches, the amount assessed shall be the total installation cost less the
difference in the cost of the pipes, fittings and valves between the
installation of an eight-inch water main and the water main installed. The
costs shall be determined as described in paragraph (d)(3) hereof.
         F.   The specifications and standards of construction for all water
main extensions shall be subject to the approval of the Village.
         G.   The size of all water mains shall be determined by the Village
Administrator and shall be large enough not only to serve the areas under
immediate consideration, but also to serve areas which are likely to be
developed and which should be served by the water main under consideration. 
Unless otherwise approved by the Village Administrator, no water main shall be
smaller than eight inches nominal diameter.
         H.   All extensions of water mains shall include the installation of
all taps, service lines, valves and fire hydrants. The number and location of
fire hydrants shall be in accordance with the requirements of the Village. The
number and location of all taps, service lines and valves shall be required by
the Village.
         I.   1.   No water mains shall be installed except by the Village,
unless authorized by an agreement between the Village and the developer or
applicant. Where water mains are installed by a developer not owned by the
developer or applicant nor included in the agreement, the developer or
applicant shall be entitled to reimbursement from the funds collected by the
Village for such connections pursuant to subsection (b) hereof when such
parcels are connected to the water main within ten years after the completion
of the water main. The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined by
dividing the cost of the water man paid for by the developer or applicant by
the available frontage abutting on the water main, provided that the total
amount of reimbursement shall not exceed twenty dollars ($20.00) per front foot
of property served.
            2.   To be eligible for this reimbursement, the developer or
applicant must file with the Village, within ninety days after the completion
of the water main, in accordance with the standards and specifications adopted
by the Village, receipts for all labor and material used in connection with the
construction of the water main, together with final, as-built plans, properly
referenced for future location of the work.
         J.   The Village Administrator shall issue a letter of completion
within thirty days after he or she receives a certified cost of construction
statement as herein provided. The water mains and other appurtenances shall,
effective the date of the letter of completion, become the property of, and
title shall immediately vest in, the Village, its successors or assigns. All
easements and rights of way shall be transferred to the Village.
   (e)   Establishment of Water Main Construction Reimbursement Fund.
      (1)   There is hereby established a special fund to be known as the Water
Main Construction Reimbursement Fund, which shall be used exclusively for the
deposit of water main construction reimbursement charges and for the payment of
reimbursements to developers for off-site extensions.
      (2)   Moneys received and disbursed pursuant to the authorization of this
section shall be accounted for on a project-by-project basis so that
reimbursement to developers is directly related to water main construction
reimbursement charges paid by owners of properties abutting their improvement.
   (f)   Variances. There will be no exceptions granted in whole or in part to
this section, except that upon application and allegations, submitted in
writing, that extraordinary circumstances may deter strict compliance with this
section, the case may be referred to the Village Council for the purpose of
hearing the cause and determining limitations. In order that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest may be served, the Village
Administrator may recommend the adoption of modified regulations in lieu of the
regulations causing hardship, provided that such variation will not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purposes of this section, with the approval
of Council.

involved, and the developer or applicant shall make a deposit to the Village
that is sufficient to cover the estimated cost of the extension. If the actual
cost of the extension is higher or lower than the deposit, the developer or
applicant will be refunded the amount of any excess deposit or shall pay to the
Village any deficit that may exist in the deposit, as the case may be.
         E.   When sanitary sewer extensions are installed by the Village, the
cost may be assessed against the abutting property owners, with the approval of
the Village Council. Such assessment shall be an amount equal to the total
installation cost, unless the sewer is required by the Village to be oversized
as described in paragraph (d)(3)A. hereof. When the Village requires the
installation of an oversized sanitary sewer, the amount assessed shall be the
total installation cost less the difference in the cost of the pipes, wye
branches and manholes between the installation of the developer's or the
applicant's required sanitary sewer and the sanitary sewer installed. The costs
shall be determined as described in paragraph (d)(3)B. hereof.
         F.   The specifications and standards of construction for all sanitary
sewer extensions shall be subject to the approval of the Village Administrator.
         G.   1.   The size of all sanitary sewers shall be determined by the
Village Administrator and shall be large enough not only to serve the areas
under immediate consideration, but also to serve areas which are likely to be
developed and which should be served by the sanitary sewer under consideration.
            2.   Unless otherwise approved by the Village Administrator, no
sanitary sewer shall be smaller than eight inches nominal diameter.
         H.   All sanitary sewer extensions shall include manholes, cleanouts,
service connections and riser pipe connections. The number and location of
manholes, cleanouts, service connections and riser pipe connections shall be in
accordance with the requirements of the Village.
         I.   No sanitary sewer shall be installed except by the Village,
unless authorized by an agreement between the Village and the developer or
applicant. Where sanitary sewers are extended by a developer or applicant and
abut on parcels not owned by the developer or applicant, nor included in the
agreement, the developer or applicant shall be entitled to reimbursement from
the funds collected by the Village for such connections pursuant to subsection
(b) hereof when such parcels are connected to the sanitary sewer within ten
years after the completion of the sanitary sewer. The amount of the
reimbursement shall be determined by dividing the cost of the sanitary sewer
paid for by the developer or applicant by the available frontage abutting on
the sanitary sewer, provided that the total amount of reimbursement shall not
exceed thirty dollars ($30.00) per front foot of property served. To be
eligible for this reimbursement, the developer or applicant must file with the
Village, within ninety days after the completion of the sanitary sewer, in
accordance with the standards and specifications adopted by the Village,
receipts for all labor and material used in connection with the construction of
the sanitary sewer, together with final, as-built plans, properly referenced
for future location of the work.
         J.   The Village Administrator shall issue a letter of completion
within thirty days after he receives a certified cost of construction statement
as herein provided. The sanitary sewer and other appurtenances shall, effective
the date of the letter of completion, become the property of, and title shall
immediately vest in, the Village, its successors or assigns. All easements and
rights of way shall be transferred to the Village.
   (e)   (1)   Establishment of Sanitary Sewer Construction Reimbursement Fund.
There is hereby established a special fund to be known as the Sanitary Sewer
Construction Reimbursement Fund, which shall be used exclusively for the
deposit of sanitary sewer construction reimbursement charges and for the
payment of reimbursement to developers for off-site extensions.
      (2)   Moneys received and disbursed pursuant to the authorization of this
section shall be accounted for on a project-by-project basis so that
reimbursement to developers is directly related to sanitary sewer construction
reimbursement charges paid by properties abutting their improvement.
   (f)   Variances. There will be no exceptions granted, in whole or in part,
to this section, except that upon application and allegations, submitted in
writing, that extraordinary circumstances may deter strict compliance with this
section, the case may be referred to the Village Council for the purpose of
hearing the cause and determining limitations. In order that substantial
justice may be done and the public interest may be served, the Village
Administrator may recommend the adoption of modified regulations in lieu of the
regulations causing hardship, provided that such variations will not have the
effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of this section, with the approval
of Council.

within sixty days of the time said property becomes contiguous to the Village
of Mount Gilead, Ohio, prepare and file or join in the preparation and filing
of an annexation petition pursuant to Ohio R.C. 709.02 for such property to be
annexed to the Village of Mount Gilead, Ohio. The failure of any such
nonresident wastewater customer to comply with this condition shall be grounds
for immediate termination of sanitary sewer service to the property.
   (d)   In the event a meter is enlarged, the difference between the charges
for the two meter sizes shall be paid.
   (e)   Subsection (b) hereof shall not apply to the holder of a permit issued

normal sewage, the excess concentration either or both, as the case may be,
shall be subject to a surcharge as follows:
      (1)   Pounds of excess suspended solids per day x $0.212/lb = Suspended
Solids Surcharge.
      (2)   Pounds of excess BOD per day x $0.151/lb = BOD Surcharge.
   (c)   In addition to the surcharge, the user will pay the user charges set
forth in Section
915.05 or
915.06.
   (d)   The pounds of BOD per day and/or the pounds of suspended solids per

915.08  ANNUAL REVIEW OF CHARGES; PENALTY FOR LATE PAYMENT.
   (a)   Annual Review of Charges. The sewer service charge and user charges
shall be reviewed annually by the Village in order to determine whether or not
they are sufficient to defray the fixed charges, amortization costs and annual
cost of operation and maintenance of the sewerage system. If the difference
between the total annual review derived and the total annual cost is sufficient
to justify an increase or decrease in the sewer service charge for user
charges, the Village will adjust the rates as required. The purpose of the
annual review is also to maintain a proportional user charge.
   Each user shall be notified at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the sewer service charge that is
attributable to operation, maintenance and replacement costs of wastewater

(Ord. 1106. Passed 8-3-87.)
917.07  DRAINAGE.
   All footer or other subsurface water shall be discharged into the storm
sewer-age system. Downspouts and surface water shall be directed to storm
sewers. There shall be no drainage of surface or subsurface water into sanitary
sewers.
(Ord. 1106. Passed 8-3-87.)
917.08  EXTENSIONS.
   (a)   When storm sewer extensions are required as part of a development, the

   (b)   The Village may complete main trunk lines in cooperation with others
or on its own.
(Ord. 1106. Passed 8-3-87.)
917.09  REDIRECTING SUBSURFACE AND SURFACE WATER.
   (a)    Where a property owner's downspouts, footers or other subsurface or
surface water drains into the sanitary sewerage system, the Village will assist
the property owner in diverting it to or into the storm sewerage system. The
Village's responsibility shall be :
      (1)   To determine where such water shall be drained ; and
      (2)   To dig any ditches required for tile, install the tile and
backfill.
   (b)   The property owner's responsibilities shall include:
      (1)   Purchasing the tile;
      (2)   Restoring yard or property disturbed by the operation (sidewalks,
trees and shrubbery);
      (3)   Doing and/or paying for work that may be required within any
buildings; and
      (4)   Thereafter, maintaining any tile lines installed to the Village's
storm sewer.
(Ord. 1106. Passed 8-3-87.)
917.10  STORM WATER RATES.
   (a)   “Storm sewer rates” are established by considering factors, including
the current customer base, the amount billed, and anticipated to be billed in
the future, the operational costs and expenses anticipated to be sustained in
the future, the maintenance and repair costs recorded in the past and those
anticipated to be sustained in the future, and past and future debt service.
   (b)   Storm water utility fees provide for a comprehensive storm water
management program that includes capital improvements to address neighborhood
and street flooding, maintenance of existing storm water infrastructure and
programs to water quality protection programs to ensure compliance with Ohio
EPA regulation. The rates are based on a property’s contribution to storm water
runoff and are categorized by residential and non-residential land use.
   (c)   Customers are charged based on the amount of impervious (non-
penetrable) area a property is known to have, such as pavement and rooftops. A
billing unit, called an equivalent residential unit (or ERU), is equal to 2,000
square feet of impervious area. Properties that do not have storm sewer
service, water service, or sanitary sewer service will all receive a storm
water bill. This is because all properties in the Village contribute to the
Village’s storm water runoff. The entire community benefits from storm water
management.
      (1)   Storm water charges for single-family residential properties.  All
single-family residential properties are calculated at one ERU and are billed
the same flat rate. The initial residential rate is set at two dollars and
fifty cents ($2.50) per month; increases in this rate shall be approved by a
vote of Village Council.
      (2)   Storm water charges for non-residential properties.  Non-
residential properties will be calculated by how much impervious area the
property is known to have using Village records, aerial photography data, and
other records. A property with 10,000 square feet of impervious area would be
billed at five ERUs (10,000 divided by 2,000). Detailed calculations will be
generated as the implementation of the storm water program progresses. The
initial rate for all non-residential properties will be set at one and one-half
times the residential rate. This rate can be charged by detailed calculations
provided by the property owner or by the Village. The acceptance of these
calculations will be made by a vote of Council.
(Ord. 1708. Passed 12-1-14)
917.99  PENALTY.
   Whoever violates or fails to comply with any of the provisions of this
chapter is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one
hundred dollars ($100.00) for each offense. A separate offense shall be deemed
committed each day during or on which a violation or noncompliance occurs or
continues.

   (a)   The Village shall make and enforce rules and regulations establishing
the types and characteristics of sewage, industrial wastes and other matters
which shall be discharged into the sanitary sewerage system, the types and
characteristics of sewage and industrial wastes admissible to the system only
after pretreatment and requisites for pretreatment, and otherwise governing the
discharge of sewage, industrial wastes and other matters into the system, in
the interest of safety and efficient operation of the wastewater treatment
plant. Applicable industrial pretreatment conditions and industrial
pretreatment regulations, as promulgated under Section 307(b) of the Clean
Water Act, are hereby incorporated in this chapter by reference and made a part
hereof.
   (b)   An industry must, upon application for sewer service, present to the
Village a tabulation of the chemical analysis of the wastes to be discharged to
the sewerage system and the volume of such wastes, or if this is not available,
the expected waste analysis based on similar processes now in operation.
   (c)   In cases where the character of sewage or industrial waste from any
manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it will
dam-age the sewerage system or cannot be treated satisfactorily at the
wastewater treatment plant, the Village shall compel such user to dispose of
such waste and prevent it from entering the sewerage system.
   (d)   In cases where the character of the sewage or industrial waste from
any manufacturing or industrial plant, building or premises is such that it
imposes an unreasonable burden upon the sewage collection, pumping or treatment
works, greater than that imposed by the average sewage entering the sewerage
system, the Village may compel such manufacturing or industrial plant, building
or premises to pretreat such sewage in such manner as specified by the Village
before discharging it into the sewerage system; require flow control or
equalization of such wastes so as to avoid any slug loads or excessive loads
that may be harmful to the treatment works; or require payment of a surcharge
on any excessive flows or loadings discharged to the treatment works to cover
the additional costs of having capacity for and treating such wastes.
   (e)   The discharge of nonacceptable industrial wastewater into the sewerage
system, whether directly or indirectly, is prohibited. Wastewater shall be
deemed nonacceptable when the concentration of harmful or toxic substances in
the waste-water exceeds certain prescribed tolerable limits. Toxic or harmful
substances include, but are not limited to, the following:

industrial user's premises outside of the building. When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Village may allow such
a facility to be constructed in the public right of way, with the approval of
the public agency having jurisdiction of such right of way, and located so that
it will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (e)   When more than one user can discharge into a common sewer, the Village
may require the installation of separate monitoring equipment for each user.
When there is a significant difference in wastewater constituents and
characteristics produced by different operations of a single user, the Village
may require that separate monitoring facilities be installed for each
discharge.
   (f)   Whether constructed on public or private property, the monitoring
facilities shall be constructed in accordance with the Village requirements and
all applicable construction standards and specifications.
   (g)   Compliance determinations with respect to the prohibitions and
limitations stated in Section

(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1115.02  MINOR SUBDIVISION REVIEW PROCEDURES.
   (a)    Plat approval of a minor subdivision is not required if the proposed
subdivision of a parcel of land meets all of the following conditions:
      (1)   The proposed subdivision is located along an existing publicly
dedicated street or road and does not involve the opening, widening or
extension of any street or road.
      (2)   The proposed subdivision involves not more than five lots after the
original tract has been completely subdivided. "Completely subdivided,"as used
in this section, means a tract which is divided into as many lots as the
subdivider intends for the tract.
      (3)   The proposed subdivision is not contrary to applicable provisions
of
the Zoning Code, these Regulations or other Village laws.
      (4)   The further division of an original tract which has been previously
divided into five lots requires the replatting of the original tract.
   Sections
1117.01 to
1117.03 are to be complied with even though plat approval is not required when
a minor subdivision meets the requirements of paragraphs (a)(1) to (4) hereof.
   (b)    Any person proposing to create a subdivision which meets all of the
conditions set forth in subsection (a) hereof shall submit the following
information to the Tax Map Department of the Morrow County, Ohio, Engineer's
Office for approval.
      (1)    The conveyance documents, all copies thereof, together with two
copies of a survey drawing and a legal description of the parcel or parcels
involved, prepared by a registered surveyor. The survey shall indicate the
following:
         A.   The location of the proposed subdivision. Such description shall
include the tract, boundaries, the township, the section number, a north arrow
and a scale (one inch equals 100 feet).
         B.   The location of all existing streets on or abutting the parcel to
be subdivided.
         C.   Lot lines with width and depth dimensions, in feet.
         D.   The location and dimensions of all portions of the original tract
not subdivided into lots.
         E.   The recording date, the name of recorded owners of the parcel to
be subdivided and the certification and seal of the registered surveyor, which
shall indicate that the survey made by him or her balances and closes and that
all dimensions and geodetic details are accurate and correct.
      (2)    An affidavit of compliance provided by the approving authority.
   (c)    After the Tax Map Department of the Morrow County, Ohio, Engineer's
Office is satisfied that such proposed subdivision is not contrary to the
provisions of subsection (a) hereof and any other current regulations of the
Engineer's Office, the same shall be approved. All pertinent information must
be attached before approval will be considered. All surveys shall adhere to the
"Minimum -Standards for Boundary Survey in the State of Ohio." In the event the
approving authority is not satisfied that the proposed subdivision complies
with these Regulations, then the person proposing the same shall submit the
above information to the Chairperson of the Planning Commission. The Planning
Commission shall, within thirty days after submission of the information
required in subsections (a) and (b) hereof, review such information. If the
proposed subdivision is in accordance with the provisions of these Regulations
as are specifically applicable, the Commission shall approve the same as a
minor subdivision and, upon presentation of an instrument of conveyance for the
parcel or parcels, shall stamp thereon, "Approved by the Village of Mount
Gilead Planning Commission." Such document shall be signed by the Planning
Commission'sClerk, Secretary or other designated official. In its consideration
of the proposed subdivision, the Planning Commission may require such other
information as it deemsnecessary for its determination under this section.

1117.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of this chapter is to establish design principles and standards
whicha subdivider shall be required to follow in the layout of a subdivision.
The principles and standards provided in this chapter shall be carried out in
compliance with these Regulations, other regulations of the State and
specifications for each of the various improvements that may be required by the
Village Engineer.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1117.02  CONSIDERATION OF TOPOGRAPHIC CONDITIONS.
   Major and minor subdivisions shall be planned to take advantage of the
topographic conditions of the land in order to economize in the construction of
publicfacilities and services, to reduce the amount of grading and to minimize
the destruction of trees, lakes, watercourses and topsoil.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1117.03  MINOR SUBDIVISIONS.
   (a)    Lots. Lots in minor subdivisions shall be designed as follows:
      (1)   Conformity with Zoning Code.A lot's size, width, depth and minimum
building setback line shall conform to existing Zoning Code regulations.
      (2)   Depth.No lot depth shall exceed three times the lot width.
   (b)    Storm Sewers. Storm sewers in minor subdivisions shall be designed as
follows:
      (1)    If the minor subdivision is in an area where a public storm water
system is not available, the subdivider shall do such grading and provide such
drainage structures as may be required by the Village Engineer.
      (2)   Where a storm drainage system is reasonably accessible, as
determined by the Village Engineer, the subdivider shall extend and connect the
subdivision's storm sewers with such storm drainage system and shalldo such
grading and provide such drainage structures as may be required by the Village
Engineer.
      (3)   All downspouts must empty into approved storm sewers.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)

      (1)   Arrangement. The arrangement, character, extent, width and location
of all streets shall conform to the Parks and Open Space Plan and the
Thoroughfare Plan of current adoption. The design of proposed streetsshall
provide for the continuation of existing streets and access to adjacent
unplatted lands so that the entire area can be served by a coordinated street
system.
      (2)   Right of way widths. The width of a right of way on any street
shall be as follows:

it is not to be subdivided. Any legal instrument creating such a reservation
shall so state this intent.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1119.07  EXTRA-SIZE AND OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS.
   When streets or utilities are not available at the boundary of a proposed
subdivision, thereby necessitating off-site extensions or improvements of
streets or utilities, and when extra-size utility lines and streets (greater in
size than is required to serve the proposed subdivision) are required for the
proper future growth of an area, the Planning Commission may require, as a
condition precedent to approval of a preliminary plan and subdivision plat,
assurances that such off-site extensions and extra-size improvements will be
provided in accordance with the following:
   (a)   Utility Extensions. Utility extensions from the proposed subdivision
shall be installed and constructed in such a location, in such a manner and of
such size as to make their extension usable in accordance with governmental
regulations for servicing adjacent areas. With regard to drainage utilities,
such adjacent areas shall include the downstream area of the particular
drainage district and the uphill drainage and extra size lines as determined by
reasonable engineering standards.
   (b)   Off-Site Extensions. If the Planning Commission, in conjunction with
Council, finds that off-site extensions require the crossing of undeveloped
lands and that a special assessment would not be warranted against such lands
until some future time, or if a governmental expenditure for such purpose is
not then warranted, and if this same condition exists on extra-size facilities
which will later benefit and enhance other property, then the developer may be
required, as a condition precedent to approval, to obtain all necessary
easements or rights of way, and improvements so constructed shall be dedicated
and granted to the public and not maintained under private ownership. All such
improvements shall be available for connections by developers of adjoining
lands.
   (c)   Reimbursement. To provide for reimbursement to the developer for the
costs of such installation of off-site extensions and extra-size facilities
(suchcosts to include construction costs, all costs for engineering and legal
services properly allocated thereto, and any other costs necessary and proper
in determining the entire cost of such improvement), contractual arrangements
shall be made between Council and the developer, as approved by the Village
Engineer, setting forth the total amount of reimbursement, together with a pro-
rata usage reimbursement plan, including the nature and method of determining
the amount of such reimbursement and the time or times at which the same shall
occur. Such contractual arrangements shall be accomplished and completed prior
to theimprovements being started. It is the intent of the Village to secure
reimbursement to the developer at such time or times as connections to the off-
site improvements are made and extra-size facilities are used by developers of
adjoining or benefiting lands.
   As future development occurs on adjoining or benefiting lands, the original
developer shall be reimbursed in accordance with the contractual arrangements
referred to above, and each successive developer shall exhibitto the Planning
Commission a receipt showing reimbursement prior to final subdivision approval
relating to such adjoining or benefiting lands.
   (d)   Deposit. Council may construct and pay for the off-site extensions and
extra-size facilities, assess the costs of the same to the owners benefited and
require a deposit from the developer as described in Section
1119.08. Council may establish a rotary fund to pay for such-development costs
and not collect the assessment on the intervening land until it is developed.
   (e)   Prorated Costs. In making determinations for prorating costs for the
construction of off-site extensions or extra-size improvements, the
PlanningCommission shall consider, in addition to the standards set forth in
this section and other regulations of the State or Village, the following
conditions.
      (1)   The relative location and size of the proposed subdivision.
      (2)   The traffic estimated to be generated by the development in
relation to present streets.
      (3)   The natural drainage area for sewers and the service area for
water.
      (4)   The development benefits that will accrue to the subdivision.
      (5)   The sequence of land and utility developments in the vicinity.
      (6)   Any other conditions it may deem necessary.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1119.08  CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Preconstruction Meeting and Work Schedules. Prior to any construction
of any project involving the Village Engineer, a preconstruction meeting will
be held between the subdivider and the Village Engineer. At this time the
project will be discussed in regard to procedure, materials and inspections.
   (b)    Inspections.
      (1)    Responsible officials. The Village Engineer or his or her
representative shall be responsible for the inspection of all improvements.
      (2)   Authority and duties. The Village Engineer or his or her
representative shall be authorized to inspect the construction of all
improvements and all materials furnished. Such inspection may extendto all or
any part of the improvements and to the preparation, fabrication or manufacture
of materials to be used. The Village Engineer shall designate the Inspector,
and the Inspector shall not be authorized to revoke, alter or waive any
requirements of the improvement specifications or plans. He or she shall be
authorized to call to the attention of the contractor any failures of the work
or materials to conform to the improvement specifications and contract. He or
she shall have the authority to reject materials which do not meet
specification requirements or suspend the portion of the work involved.
   Periodic inspection during the installation of improvements shallbe made by
the Village Engineer to ensure conformity with the approved plans and
specifications as provided in the subdivider's construction agreement.
   (3)   Final inspection. Upon completion of all improvements, the subdivider
shall request, in writing, a final inspection by the Village Engineer, as
required under Ohio R.C. 711.091. The Village Engineer shall make a final
inspection of all street improvements, storm and sanitary sewer improvements
and water improvements.
   (c)    Responsibilities.
      (1)   Plans: cooperation of subdivider and/or contractor with Village
Engineer. The subdivider shall have available on the project, at all times, two
copies of all approved improvement plans and specifications.He or she shall
cooperate with the Village Engineer and with other contractors in every way
possible. The subdivider shall at all times have a competent superintendent
acting as his or her agent on the project. The superintendent shall be capable
of reading and thoroughly understanding the improvement plans and
specifications, and he or she shall receive instructions from the Inspector.
The Village Engineer's orders shall be executed without delay.
      (2)   Repair of damaged improvements. Any damage done to the improvements
by construction traffic or by any other means shall be repaired or the damaged
materials replaced to the satisfaction of the Village Engineer before the next
item of construction is begun.
      (3)   Maintenance of improvements. The subdivider shall be responsible
for the maintenance of the improvements installed and shall be responsible for
providing the services necessary to guarantee access toall occupied lots,
including plowing snow, until final acceptance of such improvements by the
Village. The subdivider shall be given noticeby the Village Engineer of the
need for such maintenance or service. If the subdivider fails to perform such
necessary maintenance or service within thirty days from the date the notice
was issued by the Village Engineer, the Village may perform such service and
bill the subdivider therefor. Payment shall be guaranteed by the performance
bond.
   (d)    Completion Guarantees
      (1)   Assurance of completion of improvements. No lot, proposed lot or
parcel of land which is subject to these Regulations shall be sold or leased,
nor shall there be any building permit issued for the construction of a
building on such lot or parcel of land, until the improvements required by
these Regulations have been completed or an assurance of completion of
improvements has been given. The assurance of completion of improvements shall
be satisfied by furnishing a performance bond or surety bond, as approved by
the Village Solicitor, to the Village. When the performance bond and the
assurance of completion of improvements have been satisfied, the Village, if
requested by the subdivider, will provide a written document accepting the
improvements for ownership and for future maintenance.
      (2)   Reduction of bonds. The developer shall give written notice to the
Village Engineer, when improvements covered by the bond provided for in
paragraph (d)(1) hereof have been completed, that the Village Engineer shall
then make any and all inspections essential to determine that such improvements
conform to all standards of these Regulations, and that the Village Engineer,
within fourteen days of receiving the heretofore described written notice,
shall convey a written report to Council and the developer, stating his or her
approval or disapproval, as the case may be. In the event that the Village
Engineer disapproves, he or she shall state his or her reasons for doing so in
a written report to both parties. -Upon approval of the improvements, the
performance bond or surety bond shall be replaced by a maintenance bond equal
to ten percent of the performance bond for a duration of one year. This
maintenance bond will be released after the final acceptance inspection.
      (3)   Liability. The subdivider shall furnish evidence of general public
liability and property damage insurance coverage in the amounts of five hundred
thousand dollars ($500,000) for the death of or injury to any one person, one
million dollars ($1,000,000) for the death of or injury to two or more persons
in any one accident and five hundred thousand dollars ($500,000) for property
damage in any one accident, with an insurance company authorized to do business
in the State. Such insurance shall indemnify and save harmless the Village from
any and all liability arising by reason of the condition of the streets of such
subdivision or out of the construction or installation of all such
improvements. A copy of the insurance policy shall remain at all times with the
Village
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1119.09  MINIMUM LENGTHS.
   All improvements as described in this chapter shall be constructed in
lengths of not less than 400 feet as part of a single project, unless the
Village Engineer, for good cause shown, shall authorize the construction
improvements of a lesser length.

1121.01  PURPOSE OF PROJECTS.
   Planned unit developments are separate entities with a distinct character
whichis intended to be in harmony with surrounding developments. Projects which
are designed solely to circumvent these Regulations or applicable zoning
regulations shallnot be approved. Projects must clearly demonstrate that
natural features are being preserved, that amenities are being provided which
would enhance the livability of such projects and that such attributes of such
projects could not be achieved with strict adherence to these Regulations.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.02  MINIMUM AREA.
   A minimum area of fifty acres is suggested for a planned unit development to
allow sufficient flexibility and imaginative design.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.03  PRIVATELY- OR PUBLICLY-OWNED COMMON PROPERTY; HOMEOWNER'S
ASSOCIATIONS.
   A major element of the planned unit development is privately- or publicly-
owned common property within the development. These developments usually
contain such features as an internal park network abutting home sites,
recreational facilities and preservations of natural amenities. A homeowner's
association should be established to provide for the maintenance of all
properties held in common.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
   1121.04  CONFORMITY TO RIGHT-OF-WAY STANDARDS.
   Whenever a planned unit development abuts or contains an existing or
proposed major thoroughfare, the right-of-way standards, as contained in these
Regulations, shall be applicable. If a planned unit development abuts or
contains an existing minor residential street, such street must meet the
requirements of these Regulations.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.05  PUBLIC STREETS.
   The Planning Commission may require certain streets within a planned unit
development to be public if it determines that the project density necessitates
the use of public streets and that traffic connections to adjacent plats or
developments are required for adequate circulation.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.06  STAGES OF DEVELOPMENT; CONSTRUCTION OF OPEN SPACESAND PUBLIC AND
RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.
   Each stage of a planned unit development must be so designed so as to stand
independently of future related stages in the event that future stages are not
constructed. The construction and provision of all of the common open spaces
and public and recreational facilities which are shown on the final development
plan shall proceed at the same rate of construction as that of dwelling units.
The Planning Commission shall not approve the final development plan for any
stage of a planned unit development unless the average of the allowable
dwelling units per stage, up to and including the stage which is to be
approved, does not exceed, by more than ten percent, the average number of
dwelling units per stage which is allowable for the entire planned unit
development.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.07  COMMON OPEN SPACE GUARANTEES.
   (a)   Common open space, privately owned, shall require provisions for
maintenance and the financing of such maintenance to insure continuity,
conservation,maintenance and preservation, in order to prevent its diversion
and deterioration, in the manner hereinafter set forth. Publicly owned common
open space shall be the responsibility of the governmental entity approving or
accepting the same on the plat.
   (b)   If privately owned common property is a part of the plan, then the
developer shall establish an open space development plan, which shall include
such plats, agreements, protective covenants, easements and documents to be
recorded providing for the ownership, maintenance and financing of such
maintenance of the common open space, together with the documents establishing
a homeowner's association for the maintenance of all properties held in common.
   (c)   In the event that the owner established to own, develop and maintain
the common open space, or any successor, shall, at any time after the
establishment of such open space development, fail to maintain the common open
space in reasonable order and condition in accordance with the plan, or permit
it to deteriorate so as to constitute a public nuisance, then the governmental
unit having jurisdiction over the same may serve written notice upon such owner
or upon the residents of the open space development area, setting forth the
manner in which the owner has failed to maintain the common open space in
reasonable condition or has permitted a public nuisance to develop. Such notice
shall include a demand that such deficiencies be cured within thirty days
thereof and shall state the date and place of hearing thereon before the
governmental unit, which is to be held within fifteen days after the notice. At
such hearing the governmental unit may modify the terms of the original notice
as to the deficiencies and may give an extension of time within which they
shall be cured. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the
modification thereof are not cured within such thirty days, or any extension
thereof, the governmental unit, in order to prevent further deterioration or to
abate the public nuisance, may enter upon the common open space and maintain
the same until the owner established for such purpose resumes its
responsibility. Such entry, maintenance and abatement upon the common open
space shall not vest in the governmental unit any rights to use the common open
space for any other purpose, nor shall such entry constitute a dedication.
   (d)   To provide for the costs of such maintenance and abatement by the
governmental unit, the developer or the owner established to.own the common
open space shall, simultaneously with the execution of the unit plat, grant to
the governmental unit a conservation easement vesting in the governmental unit
all of the rights necessary to carry out the terms of this section, as well as
all of the rights of the developer or the owner of the open space to collect
dues or assessments from the property owners within the development, which dues
and assessments, or a reasonable substitution therefor, for the maintenance of
the common open space, shall be an obligation upon the property owners by
virtue of such conservation easement or recorded protective covenants, as well
as any articles of incorporation or bylaws of any owner's association formed to
hold title to the common open space.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.08  CONSTRUCTION OF NONRESIDENTIAL USES.
   If a planned unit development contains nonresidential uses, these uses may
be constructed first, but only if the Planning Commission finds, and records
its finding on the final development plan, that the nonresidential uses are
consistent with the Comprehensive Plan for the community even though the
residential area of the planned unit development is not built or not completed.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)
1121.09  CONDOMINIUM OWNERSHIP.
   Ohio R.C. Chapter 5311 provides for the recording of ownership of
condominiums. Condominium ownership does not excuse compliance with these
Regulations whenever appropriate.
(Ord. 1222. Passed 12-16-91.)

APPENDIX 1
General Provisions and Definitions
   Subdivision Regulations. The Subdivision Regulations, as provided in Title
Three of the Planning and Zoning Code of the Codified Ordinances, regulate the
division of land, its planning and development into what is known as a
subdivision.
   Section 1115.02   Minor Subdivision
   Section 1115.03   Major Subdivision
   However, land divided under certain specifications or conditions is not
classified as a subdivision; therefore, the regulations of Sections
1115.02 and
1115.03 do not apply.
   Division of Land That is a Subdivision.
   (a)   When a parcel of land shown as a unit or contiguous units on the last
preceding tax role is divided into two or more parcels, sites or lots, any one
of which is less than five acres, for the purpose, now or in the future, for
transfer of ownership.
   (b)   Improvement of one or more parcels for residential and commercial or
industrial structures involving the allocation of land for opening, widening or
extending streets, except private streets for industrial structures.
   (c)   Division or allocation of land as open spaces, for the common use of
owners, occupants or tenants or as easements for public sewer, water, storm
drainage or other public facilities.
   Division of Land Not a Subdivision.
   (a)   Some divisions of land are not subdivisions.
   (b)   If a division of land is not a subdivision, then these Regulations do
not apply and no plat is required.
   (c)   The following divisions are not subdivisions:
      (1)   Division of a parcel into two or more parcels, all of which are
five acres or more, not involving new streets (public or private) or easements
of access.
      (2)   Sale or exchange of parcels between adjoining land owners, if no
additional building sites are created.
      (3)   Transfer of an existing piece of land as a whole that has been
previously recorded by metes and bounds description.
      (4)   Normally the transfer of a lot that is recorded as a lot in a major
subdivision. The transfer of a part of such lot will not be a subdivision
unless it is less than five acres and involves new streets (public or private)
or easements of access, or unless it creates additional building sites and is
not a sale or exchange between adjoining land owners.
   (d)   If the land to be divided is a subdivision, then the owners will have
to proceed with formal platting requirements, as provided in Section
1115.03, unless the division of land meets the minor subdivision category, as
provided in Section
1115.02 (Ohio R.C. 711.131).
   (e)   If the minor subdivision criteria are met, no plat is required and the
conveyance (deed) shall be stamped "Approved - No Plat Required". A drawing may
be required. These Regulations provide a simplified procedure.
   (f)   If the criteria for a minor subdivision are not met, then the major
subdivision requirements of these Regulations must be followed, unless a
hardship exists to qualify for a variance.
   What is a Minor Subdivision?
   (a)    It is a division of land that:
      (1)   Must be a division of a parcel along an existing public street; and
      (2)   Must not involve the opening, widening or extension of any street
or road; and
      (3)   Must involve no more than five lots after the original tract has
been completely subdivided; and
      (4)   Must not be contrary to applicable platting, subdividing or zoning
regulations.
   Ohio R.C. 711.131 sets forth other requirements to be met by a minor
subdivision.
   (b)    Keep these definitions in mind:
      (1)    The full definition of a minor subdivision (above).
      (2)    Original tract (based on Ohio Attorney General Opinion 71-083),
which means a contiguous quantity of land held by one person, or in
commonownership, which has not been platted by the existing owner. This means:
         A.   A tract can be original to one person and not to another.
         B.   "Original" does not mean initial source.
         C.   Subdividing is permitted through successive ownership.
      (3)    Completely subdivided means:
         A.   When a tract is divided into as many lots as the subdivider
intends for the tract.
         B.   A specific subdivider may later decide to increase the number of
lots in a subdivision, but to do so, and assuming there are more than five lots
as a result, it would be necessary to replat the original tract.
         C.   It is possible for a tract to be "completely subdivided" and then
be further subdivided by a party who purchases or takes title to a parcel in a
subdivision large enough to be divided.
      (4)    The Ohio Attorney General has concluded:
         A.   "Tract" means a contiguous quantity of land undivided by lot
lines.
         B.   "Original contemplates a tract which has not been divided under
its present ownership.
         C.   "Original tract" means a continuous quantity of land held by one
person or in common, which has not been platted by the existingowner.
         D.   The phrase "involving no more than five lots after the original
tract has been completely subdivided" applies only to the necessity for
replatting to accomplish changes in an already subdivided tract.

publication in one or more newspapers of general circulation in the Village at
least ten days before the date of such public hearing.
      (5)   The Board may recess such hearings from time to time, and if the
time and place of the continued hearing is publicly announced at the time of
adjournment, no further notice shall be required.
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1137.08  PROCEDURES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall act according to the procedure
specified by law, including this Zoning Code.
   (b)   No action shall be taken on any request for any appeal, variance,
conditional use, exception, or nonconforming use prior to a hearing by the
Board.
   (c)   The Board shall make a decision within ten days after the hearing,
unless additional time is necessary because of unusual circumstances.
   (d)   The hearing shall be open to the public and any party may appear in
person or by attorney.
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1137.09  APPEALS.
   (a)   Appeals to the Board may be taken by any person or by any officer or
board of the Village adversely affected by the decision of the Zoning Inspector
respecting the interpretation of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Appeals shall be made not later than 30 calendar days after the date
of the action that is the subject of the grievance.
   (c)   An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the action
appealed from, unless the Zoning Inspector, whose decision is appealed from,
certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal has been filed, that by
reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would, in his or her opinion,
cause imminent peril to life or property. In such case, proceedings shall not
be stayed by other than a restraining order granted by the Board or by a court
having lawful jurisdiction.
   (d)   Appeals of Board Decisions to Council.  A decision of the Board of
Zoning Appeals may be appealed to Council. Such appeal must be filed with the

(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1137.10  VARIANCES.
   In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions as it may deem
necessary to protect the public health, safety or welfare and to further the
purpose and intent of this Zoning Code. Such conditions shall be made a part of
and be attached to the required Zoning Certificate.  In every instance of
granting a variance by the Board, there must be a showing by the Board that it
has weighed the interests of the owner against those of the neighboring
property owners and the community as a whole.
   (a)   Area Variances.  Where there are practical difficulties in carrying
out the strict letter of this Zoning Code regarding yard, height, parking, and
sign code requirements, the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an area or bulk
variance that is in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the Zoning
Code and that most of the following tests apply:
      (1)   The variance will not adversely affect the delivery of governmental
services.
      (2)   The property owner did not purchase the property with knowledge of
the zoning restriction, unless such modification of the yard or lot area or
width regulations is necessary to secure the appropriate improvement of a
parcel of land that is too small to be appropriately improved without such
modification, provided the parcel was separately owned at the time of passage
of this chapter, or is adjacent to buildings that do not conform to the general
restrictions applicable to their location.
      (3)   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions
applying to the property involved or to the intended use or development of the
property that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the same
zoning district or neighborhood that cannot be solved by some manner other than
the granting of a variance.
      (4)   The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character
of the locality or substantially impair environmental quality, property values
or public safety or welfare in the vicinity.
      (5)   A variance is necessary for the applicant to enjoy a substantial
property right possessed by other properties in the same zoning district and
does not confer a special privilege ordinarily denied to other properties in
the district.
      (6)   The grant of a variance is necessary, not because it will increase
the applicant's economic return, although it may have this effect, but because
without a variance the applicant will be deprived of beneficial use or
enjoyment of, or reasonable economic return from, the property.
   (b)   Exceptions to Permitted Uses.  An exception to a permitted use may be
granted by the Board only after review of an application therefore. The Board
may impose such requirements and conditions as it may deem necessary for the
protection of adjacent properties and the public interests.  The Board shall
not, however, have the right to change the intent of this Zoning Code by
permitting any use that cannot be reasonably interpreted as intended in the
district in question.
      (1)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant exceptions to permitted uses
where the strict application of this Zoning Code would result in unnecessary
hardship, as defined herein, for the applicant inconsistent with the general
purpose and the intent of this Zoning Code or the provisions of this Zoning
Code, due to conditions precedent or subsequent, are not precise enough or are
too general to cover all applications.
      (2)   The Board of Zoning Appeals may permit the temporary use of a
structure or premises in any district for a purpose of use that does not
conform to the regulations prescribed elsewhere in this chapter for the
district in which it is located, provided that such use is of a temporary
nature and does not involve the erection of a substantial structure.  A Zoning
Certificate for such use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and
revocable permit, for not more than a 12-month period, subject to such
conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and general
welfare.
   (c)   Exceptions to Nonconforming Uses.  The Board of Zoning Appeals may
permit changes and extensions of existing, legal nonconforming uses as follows:
      (1)   A nonconforming use of a less objectionable nature may be
substituted for an existing, legal nonconforming use;
      (2)   A nonconforming use may be substituted for an existing, legal
nonconforming use existing at the time of enactment of this chapter if no
structural alterations except those required by law or ordinance are made;
provided, however, that in an “R” District, no change shall be authorized to
any use which is not a permitted or conditional use in any “B” District;
      (3)   An existing, legal nonconforming use which occupies only a portion
of an existing structure or premises may be extended throughout such structure
or premises;
      (4)   An existing, legal nonconforming use may be extended when such
extension will substantially make the nonconforming use more in character with
its surroundings. Such extension shall not be greater than 50% of the size of
the nonconforming use that existed at the time of passage of this Zoning Code;
      (5)   It may permit the extension of a district where the boundary line
of a district divides a lot or tract held in a single ownership at the time of
the passage of this chapter;
      (6)   An existing, legal nonconforming structure may be remodeled or
repaired where the Board determines that such remodeling or repairing is in the
best interest of the Village;
      (7)   An existing, legal nonconforming use or building may be altered or
reconstructed, provided that such will make the nonconforming use substantially
more in character with its surroundings;
      (8)   An existing, legal nonconforming building which has been damaged by
explosion, fire, act of God, or the public enemy may be reconstructed to the
extent of more than 51% of its fair market value where the Board finds some
compelling necessity requiring a continuance of the nonconforming use and the
primary purpose of continuing the nonconforming use is not to continue a
monopoly.
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88 ; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1137.11  CONDITIONAL USE REVIEW STANDARDS.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and determine all conditional uses
that are specifically listed in the various districts. Conditional uses,
although often desirable, will more intensely affect the surrounding area in
which they are located than the permitted uses of such districts.  In
considering a conditional use application, the Board may impose such conditions
as it may deem necessary for the protection of adjacent properties and the
public interest, including specific limitations as to future expansion.
   (a)   The following basic standards shall generally apply to all conditional
uses such that the proposed development:
      (1)   Is specifically listed or interpreted as a conditional use in the
district in question;
      (2)   Will be in keeping with the general objectives, or with any
specific objective of the Mount Gilead Comprehensive Plan and/or the Zoning
Code;
      (3)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance and nature with the existing or
intended land use character of all adjacent uses and structures and physical
development potential of the area and will not have undesirable effects on the
surrounding area;
      (4)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (5)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal, water and sewer, and schools; or that the person
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such services;
      (6)   Will not involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment,
and conditions of operation that will be detrimental to any persons, property,
or the general welfare by reason of excessive production of traffic, noise,
smoke, fumes, or odors;
      (7)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
thoroughfares.
   (b)   The following additional standards shall apply to conditional uses in
any “S” or “R” District:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout and
its relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that both pedestrian
and vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly of persons in
connection with it will not be hazardous, inconvenient or conflict with the
normal traffic on residential streets, both at the time and as the same may be
expected to increase with any prospective increase in the population of the
area, taking into account convenient routes of pedestrian traffic, particularly
of children, relation to main traffic thoroughfares and to street
intersections, and the general character and intensity of development of the
area;
      (2)   The location and height of buildings, the location, nature, and
height of walls and fences, and the nature and extent of landscaping on the
site shall be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate
development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
   (c)   The following additional standards shall apply to conditional uses in
any “B” or “M” District:
      (1)   The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, its site layout, and
its relation to streets giving access to it shall be such that vehicular
traffic to and from the use will not be more hazardous than the normal traffic
of the district, both at the time and as the same may be expected to increase
with increasing development of the municipality, taking into account vehicular
turning movements in relation to routes of traffic flow, relation to street
intersections, sight distances, and relation to pedestrian traffic;
      (2)   The nature, location, size and site layout of the use shall be such
that it will be a harmonious part of the business or industrial district in
which it is situated, taking into account prevailing shopping habits,
convenience of access by prospective patrons, the physical and economic
relationships of one type of use to another, and characteristic groupings of
uses in a commercial or industrial district.
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1137.12  INTERPRETATION OF ZONING MAP.
   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board of
Zoning Appeals, after notice to the owners of the property, shall interpret the
Map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code.
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)

practices require, the Council may, by ordinance, after receipt of
recommendation thereon from the Planning Commission, and subject to the
procedures provided by law, amend, supplement or change the regulations,
district boundaries or classification of property, now or hereafter established
by this chapter or amendments thereof.
   (a)   Applications for amendments should meet at least one of the following
conditions:
      (1)   There is currently insufficient land throughout the Village zoned
for the particular district to meet the current and anticipated future demands;
      (2)   There has been a substantial change in the area's condition which
has rendered the original zoning obsolete;
      (3)   The land is subject to annexation by the Village;
      (4)   There are other situations where a zoning change would be
appropriate for the overall health, safety and welfare of the Village.
   (b)   Amendments or supplements to this Zoning Code may be initiated by:
      (1)   Passage of a resolution by Council.
         A.   All zoning amendments or supplements not initially made by the
Planning Commission shall be referred to the Planning Commission for review and
recommendation to Council before any action is taken by Council.
         B.   If no recommendation is received by Council within 30 days of
such referral, Council may proceed without a recommendation from the Planning
Commission if it so desires.
      (2)   Motion of the Planning Commission.
      (3)   Application of one or more owners or lessees of property within the
district to be changed.
         A.   Applications for any change of district boundaries or
classifications of property as shown on the Zoning Map shall be submitted to
the Planning Commission, at its public office upon such forms, and shall be
accompanied by such data and information as may be prescribed for that purpose
by the Planning Commission, so as to assure the fullest practicable
presentation of facts for the permanent record.  Each such application shall be
verified by at least one of the owners or lessees of property within the area
proposed to be reclassified, attesting to the truth and correctness of all
facts and information presented with the applications.
         B.   Any person or persons desiring a change in the zoning
classification of property shall file with the application for such change, a
statement giving the names and addresses of the owners of all properties lying
within 200 feet of any part of the property, the zoning classification of which
is proposed to be changed.
   (c)   Petitions for Annexation Shall Initiate Rezoning.
      (1)   Upon receipt of notice of hearing of annexation petitions, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall forward copies to the Planning Commission to consider the
appropriate zoning classification of the territory to be annexed in accordance
with this chapter.
      (2)   The Planning Commission shall make its recommendation to the
Council in a timely fashion such that the ordinance designating the zoning
classification for the territory to be annexed shall become effective at the
same time as the ordinance approving the annexation of the territory.
(Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1139.02  PLANNING COMMISSION AMENDMENT REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Notice to Property Owners of Public Hearing by Planning Commission.
      (1)   Before submitting its recommendation on a proposed amendment to the
Council, the Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing thereon, notice of
which shall be given by publication in a newspaper of general circulation in
the municipality at least 30 days before the date of the hearing, once a week
for two weeks. The notice shall state the place or places and times at which
the proposed amendment to the ordinance, including text and maps, may be
examined and other notices as required by State statutes or Planning
Commission.
      (2)   In addition to the published notice as hereinbefore specified, the
Planning Commission shall give notice of time, place and purpose of public
hearings to be held by it on proposed amendments or supplements, by mailing a
postal card or letter notice not less than 20 days prior to the date of the
hearing, to the owners of all properties lying within 200 feet of any part of
the property proposed to be changed. The failure to notify, as provided in this
section, shall not invalidate any recommendations adopted hereunder; it being
the intention of this section to provide, so far as may be possible, due notice
to the persons substantially interested in the proposed change that an
application is pending before the Planning Commission, proposing to make a
change in the zoning district map or the regulations set forth in this chapter.
   (b)   Action of Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission may recommend
to Council that the application be granted as requested, or it may recommend a
modification of the zoning amendment requested in the application, or it may
recommend that the application be not granted.  These recommendations shall be
certified to Council within 30 days after the Planning Commission hearing.
(Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1139.03  COUNCIL AMENDMENT REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   Public Hearing by Council and Notice to Property Owners.
      (1)   After receiving from the Planning Commission certification of the
recommendations on the proposed amendment and before this Zoning Code or any
amendment thereto may be adopted or passed, Council shall hold a public hearing
thereon and shall give at least 30 days notice, once a week for two weeks, of
the time and place thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in the
Village. The notice shall state the place or places and times at which the
proposed amendment to the ordinance, including text and maps, may be examined
and other notices as required by State statutes.
      (2)   Whenever an amendment to this Zoning Code intends to rezone or
redistrict ten or less parcels of land, as listed on the tax duplicate, written
notice of the hearing shall be mailed by the Clerk-Treasurer, by first class
mail, at least 20 days before the date of the public hearing, to the owners of
property within, contiguous to and directly across the street from such parcel
or parcels, to the addresses of such owners appearing on the County Auditor's
current tax list of the County Treasurer's mailing list and on such other list
that may be specified by Council. The failure of delivery of such notice shall
not invalidate any such amendment.
      (3)   During such 30-day or 20-day notice periods, as the case may be,
the text or copy of the text of the amending ordinance, together with the maps,
plans or copies thereof forming part of or referred to in such ordinance, and
any reports submitted by the Planning Commission, the Board of Zoning Appeals
or the Zoning Inspector shall be on file for public examination in the office
of the Clerk-Treasurer or in such other office as is designated by Council.
   (b)   Action of Council.  After holding the above public hearing, the
Council shall consider such recommendations and vote on the passage of the
proposed amendment to the text of the ordinance or the zoning map.
      (1)   No ordinance or amendment which is in accordance with the
recommendation, plan or report submitted by the Planning Commission, the Board
or the Zoning Inspector shall be deemed to pass or take effect without the
concurrence of at least a majority of the members elected to Council.

plan or report submitted by the Planning Commission, the Board, or the Zoning
Inspector shall take effect unless passed or approved by not less than three-
fourths of the membership of Council.

   (b)   Whenever any street, alley, or other public way is vacated by official
action of the Council, the zoning district adjoining each side of such street,
alley, or public way shall be automatically extended to the center of such
vacation.
   (c)   When a district boundary divides a lot in a single ownership existing
at the time of enactment of this Zoning Code, the use authorized on, and the
district requirements of, the least restricted portion of such lot shall be
construed as extending to the entire lot, provided that such extension shall
not include any part of the lot which is more than 50 feet from the district
boundary line.
   (d)   Where the street or lot layout actually on the ground, or as recorded,
differs from the street and lot lines as shown on the Zoning Map, the Board,
after notice to the owners of the property and after public hearing, shall
interpret the map in such a way as to carry out the intent and purpose of this
Zoning Code. In case of any questions as to the location of any boundary line
between zoning districts, a request for interpretation of the Zoning District
Map may be made to the Board and a determination shall be made by the Board.
(Ord. 1054.  Passed 12-2-85; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1141.04  ZONING OF ANNEXED LAND.
   Upon annexation of township territory to the Village, any township zoning

adopts the existing regulations or new regulations. When no township
regulations are in effect, the annexed area shall not be zoned until action is
taken to zone such area in accordance with this Zoning Code.

1143.01  PURPOSES OF OPEN SPACE DISTRICTS.
   (a)   Purpose of S-1 Special Use District.  The S-1 Special District is to
be applied to areas which are to contain large public or semi-public holdings,
areas suitable for noncommercial recreation, areas subject to periodic
flooding, or to preserve or to create areas with specific functional
residential needs. These specific functional needs shall include:
      (1)   Public and institutional activities which can, by orderly location
and arrangement of facilities, be more efficient, more accessible to the
public, and can promote higher quality of visual and functional design.
      (2)   Residential areas designed for special population groups or housing
types. Flexibility in design to create a sound living environment in districts
containing multiple family housing, condominium housing, housing for the
elderly, public housing, and the like, is encouraged. Institutional and public
services may be incorporated into the district.
      (3)   Residential planned areas whose individual activities can be
designed to relate functionally to each other, to provide adequate parking and
circulation to provide adequate points of ingress and egress while protecting
adjacent activities from adverse effects of the district.
   (b)   Purpose of A-1 Agriculture District.  The A-1 District shall apply to
land which is level or gently rolling and is best reserved for agricultural and
other rural purposes.

development which may or may not have combined water facilities or sewage
disposal services.
   (b)   The “R-2” Low-Density Residence District is for relatively low-density
residential development.  Combined water facilities and sewage disposal
services are required.
   (c)   The “R-3” Medium-Density Residence District is for medium-density
residential development which has ready access to most community facilities.
Community water and sewerage facilities are required.

1153.01  CONTINUATION OF USES.
   Except as hereinafter specified, the lawful use of a building or premises
existing at the time of the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code may be
continued, although such use, building or structure does not conform to the
provisions of this Zoning Code for the district in which it is located.
   (a)   The nonconforming use of a building may be extended throughout those
existing parts of the building which were arranged or designed for such use.
   (b)   All uses nonconforming at the time of the adoption of this section by
reason of noncompliance with Section
1155.02 (Performance standards), if not otherwise stipulated by the Board,
shall conform therewith within the time limit specified in Section
1155.02(b)(3).
   (c)   Abandonment.  A nonconforming use which is discontinued for a
continuous period of six months, where the intent of the owner to discontinue
the use is obvious, shall not again be used except in conformity with the
regulations of the district in which it is located.
   (d)   Zoning Certificate.  A Zoning Certificate shall be required for all
lawful nonconforming uses of land and building created by adoption of this
chapter in accordance with the provisions of Section
1135.02 (Zoning Certificate Required).
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1153.02  PRIOR CONSTRUCTION.
   Any building arranged, intended or designed for a nonconforming use the
construction of which has been started at the time of the passage of this
chapter, but not completed, may be completed and put into such nonconforming
use, provided it is done within one year after this chapter takes effect.
(Ord. 1054.  Passed 12-2-85; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1153.03  MODIFICATIONS; ALTERATIONS.
   No existing building or premises devoted to a use not permitted by this
Zoning Code in the district in which such building or premises is located,
except when required by law or order, shall be enlarged, extended,
reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered, unless the use thereof is
changed to a use permitted in the district in which such building or premises
is located, except as follows:
   (a)   Change to Conforming Use.  Whenever a nonconforming use has been
changed to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be changed to a
nonconforming use.
   (b)   Restoration.  Repairs and maintenance work as required to keep a
nonconforming building or structure in a sound and safe condition may be made.
   (c)   Reconstruction.  Replacement of a nonconforming use which has been
destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God, public enemy or the ravages of time
can be rebuilt so long as the cost of rebuilding does not exceed 50% of the
value of the structure.  Value of the structure will be determined by referring
to the appraised value as set by the office of the Morrow County Treasurer. 
When the damage to the structure is less than 50% of its value, a nonconforming
use may be repaired or reconstructed and used as before the time of damage,
provided such repairs or reconstruction are started within one year of the
occurrence date of such damage and complete not more than 120 days later.
   (d)   Extension.
      (1)   No nonconforming building or structure shall be moved, extended,
enlarged or altered and no nonconforming use of land shall be expanded, except
when authorized by the Board in accordance with the provisions of Section
1137.10 (Variances).
      (2)   Any building which is nonconforming solely because it does not
comply with front yard setback requirements may be altered or extended from the
side or back without a variance permit provided the alteration or extension
conforms to all requirements under this chapter.
   (e)   Substitution.
      (1)   When authorized by the Board of Zoning Appeals, in accordance with
Section
1137.10 (Variances), a nonconforming use may be substituted by another not more
objectionable nonconforming use.
      (2)   Nonconforming trailers, mobile homes, or manufactured homes located
on a lot in any district other than in an established manufactured home park in
an “R 3" District, once removed shall not be relocated on such lot unless the
unit was “traded in” for a manufactured home. In this instance, the replacement
shall be on site within one week of the removal of the previous unit.
(Ord. 1130.  Passed 2-1-88; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1153.04  EXISTING LOTS OF RECORD.
   When a lot which is an official platted lot of the Village, as recorded at
the time of adoption of this Zoning Code (Ordinance 1054, passed December 2,
1985), does not comply with the area, yard or other requirements of this Zoning
Code, such lot may be used as a building site. However, the yard and other
requirements of the district shall be complied with as closely as possible
considering the conditions present on the lot and in the opinion of the Board
of Zoning Appeals.
   (a)   Subject to compliance with provisions of this section, a lot in a
district which permits residential uses, having a width less than that required
by Section
1145.03 (Lot Area and Width), but having at least 80% of the minimum lot area
required by Section
1145.03 (Lot Area and Width), and existing as such on the effective date of
this chapter in any “R” district, may be used for the erection of a single
family dwelling even though its area and width are less than the minimum
requirements set forth herein. Each side yard shall be a minimum of six feet.
   (b)   Where two adjacent lots of record with less than the required area and
width are held by one owner, the Board may require that the lot be combined and
used for one main building. In either case, the prevailing setback shall be
met. Where three or more contiguous unimproved lots of record with less than
the required area and width are held by one owner, the Board may require
replatting to fewer lots to permit compliance with minimum yard requirements.

   (d)   Screening and Landscaping.  Off-street parking areas for more than
five vehicles shall be effectively screened on each side which adjoins or faces
premises situated in any residential district or institutional premises, by a
fence or hedge as determined by the Board of Appeals upon direct application
for such determination. Due consideration shall be given to adjacent property
owners.
   (e)   Lighting.  Any lighting used to illuminate any off-street parking area
shall be so arranged as to reflect the light away from adjoining premises in
any residential district.
(Ord. 1054.  Passed 12-2-85; Ord. 1584. Passed 9-17-07.)
1159.04  SPECIAL PARKING PROVISIONS.

a Zoning Certificate.
   (b)   Other Locations.  Parking spaces may be located on a lot within 300
feet other than that containing the principal use with the approval of the
Board of Appeals, provided a written agreement, approved by the Village Legal

         D.   The equipment shall be parked at least three feet behind the
front house line (exclusive of porches, porticos and similar projections) of
the house on the property and at least three feet away from the side and rear
lot lines of the property, except that for loading and unloading purposes the
equipment may be parked in the driveway for a period of not more than 48 hours,
and subject to the stipulation that in cases of unusual circumstances such as
topography, irregular shape of lot, location of buildings and unique hardship
the owner may appeal for a variance of these set backs. After a hearing, a
variance may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals should they find that
such variation will not be of substantial detriment to adjacent property, and
will not materially impair the purposes of this chapter or the public interest.
         E.   The equipment shall be kept in good repair and shall carry a
current year's license and/or registration.
         F.   Under no circumstances shall the area underneath or around the

more than two pieces of such equipment shall be parked upon the unenclosed
portion of the premises at any one time.
         C.   The equipment shall not be parked or inhabited upon any
unenclosed portion of the premises except in the rear and side yards of the
premises so long as parked or inhabited at least three feet away from the side
or rear yard boundaries of the premises; provided, however, the Zoning
Inspector shall be authorized to permit temporary parking and/or habitation on
the driveway in the front yard so long as he first finds that weather
conditions and lack of access prevents parking and/or habitation in the rear or
side yards of the premises.
   (c)   Prohibiting Standing or Parking Places.  No person shall stand or park
a vehicle, except when necessary to avoid conflict with other traffic or to
comply with the provisions of the Traffic Code, or while obeying the directions
of a police officer or a traffic control device upon any private property
within this Village, except upon driveways, parking lots, in garages or in an
area improved for vehicular use.

   The effective date of this chapter shall be May 19, 2010.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.02  PURPOSE AND INTENT.
   This chapter is intended to regulate Wind Energy Conversion Systems to
promote the health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Village.
It is also intended to minimize any adverse visual, audio or acoustical safety
issues of a Wind Energy Conversion System. It is designed to establish the
public processes needed to identify preferred locations for wind turbines, and
create a clear permit process.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.03  FINDINGS.
   (a)   Wind energy is a potential renewable and non-polluting energy resource
of the Village, and its conversion to electricity may reduce dependence on
nonrenewable, conventional energy sources and decrease the pollution that
results therefrom. However, wind energy facilities should be sited in a way
that protect the health and safety needs of the residents living near a large
wind turbine.
   (b)   The regulation of the siting and installation of a large wind energy
turbine system is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the village and the general public. Adverse health and safety
issues are likely to arise if appropriate standards and setbacks are not
followed in the siting and installation of large wind turbines.
   (c)   Over 500 wind turbine accidents have occurred involving ice throws,
blade disintegration, fire and tower failure in the world since 1999.
   (d)   Heavy equipment used for the construction of large wind turbines can
damage local roads.
   (e)   (1)   Large wind turbines are significant sources of noise, which if
improperly sited, can negatively impact the health of residents, particularly
in areas of low ambient noise levels. Large wind turbines emit two types of
noise: a) Aerodynamic noise from the blades passing through the air; and b)
mechanical noise from the interaction of the turbine components. Noise is an
annoyance that can negatively impact health, producing negative effects such as
sleep disturbance and deprivation, stress, anxiety, headaches, depression, pain
and stiffness, decreased cognitive ability, tinnitus, hypertension and fatigue.
While some people are unaffected by wind turbine noise, others may develop
adverse health effects from the same noise. At low frequencies wind turbine
noise may not be heard, but rather felt as a vibration.
      (2)   Few people are disturbed in their sleep with noise that is measured
at less than 35 dB(A), however some are disturbed by a change in as little as 5
dB over the original noise level. Studies show that prolonged exposure to wind
turbine noise results in adverse health effects at noise levels lower than
ordinary noise created by traffic, urban, industrial or commercial noise.
Living in a rural environment, in comparison with a suburban area, increases
the risk of residents being impacted by noise from nearby large wind turbines
because of the low ambient noise in the rural area. The international Standards
Organization recommended community noise limits for rural area be set at a SPL
of 35 dB(A) during the day, 30 dB(A) during the evening hours and 25 dB(A) at
night. Audible sound limits should be limited to 20 dB(A) above the ambient
level, with an absolute maximum level of 35-40 dB(A).
      (3)   Because Ohio R.C. 4906.20 contains no maximum noise level set as a
standard for a wind turbine system, the Village will set its own maximum noise
level at 35 dB(A).
   (f)   Adverse health effects from wind turbine noise can be exacerbated by
the rotating blades and shadows from the wind turbines. As the wind turbine
blades rotate in sunny condition, they cast strobe- like shadows on the windows
of nearby homes and buildings and nearby streets and roads causing shadow
flicker that can not be avoided. Shadow flicker can cause some people to become
dizzy, nauseated or lose their balance. The shadow flicker can produce
headaches or even seizures in photosensitive individuals.
   (g)   Wind turbines have been known to throw ice and debris from the turbine
blades. Ice throws from large wind turbines can reach distances up to 1,750
feet and blade throws can reach 2,500 feet.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.04  DEFINITIONS.
   The definitions contained herein shall apply only to this chapter.
   (a)   “Aerodynamic sound.”  A noise that is caused by the flow of air over
and past the blades of a Wind Energy Conversion system.
   (b)   “Ambient sound.”  This encompasses all sounds present in a given
environment such as farm or construction noise, a car traveling on a nearby
roadway, insects and birds, and people having conversation.
   (c)   “Anemometer.”  A device for measuring the speed and direction of the
wind.
   (d)   “Applicant.”  The individual or business entity that seeks to secure a
license under this chapter.
   (e)   “Background sound.”  This refers to the sounds that would normally be
present at least 90% of the time. “Background sounds” are those heard during
lulls in the ambient sound environment. The background sound levels vary during
different times of the day and night. Because a Wind Energy Conversion System
operates 24 hours a day, seven days a week, the background sound levels of
interest are those during the quieter periods which are often the evening and
night. Sounds from birds, insects and people must be eliminated from background
sound tests.
   (f)   “Clear area.”  The area surrounding a wind turbine that is free of any
residential or commercial structures.
   (g)   “dB(A).”  The sound pressure level in decibels refers to the “a”
weighted scale as defined by ANSI (American National Standards Institute).
   (h)   “Flicker.”  The effect of moving, periodic shadows cast on a residence
or place of business by the rotating blades of a wind turbine at those times
when the sun is shining and is aligned with the turbine and a residence or
place of business.
   (i)   “Health.”  A state of complete physical and mental well being, not
merely the absence of disease or infirmity.
   (j)   “Height.”  The total distance measured from the grade of the property
as existed prior to the construction of a Wind Energy Conversion System,
facility, tower, turbine or related facility at the base to its highest point.
   (k)   “Hub height.”  The height of a horizontal wind axis from the natural
grade at the base of the tower to the centerline of the rotor.
   (l)   “Nacelle.”  The frame and housing at the top of a wind turbine tower
that encloses the gearbox, generator, and other accessories, and protects them
from the weather.
   (m)   “Noise.”  Any unwanted sound. Not all noise needs to be excessively
loud to represent an annoyance or interference.
   (n)   “Occupied structure.”  A building in which people live, work or
frequent.
   (o)   “Property line.”  The recognized and mapped property parcel boundary
line.
   (p)   “Rotor.”  The blades and hub of the wind turbine that rotate during
the turbine operation.
   (q)   “Sound.”  A fluctuation of air pressure which is propagated as a wave
through air.
   (r)   “Total height.”  The height of a horizontal axis wind turbine measured
from the natural grade at the base of the tower to the tip of the blade at its
highest point, or the maximum height of a vertical axis wind turbine.
   (s)   “Tower.”  The structure that supports the turbine, rotor, generator
and accessory equipment. The tower may be a monopole or lattice design, with or
without guy wires, depending on the height and other factors.
   (t)   “WECS.”  Wind Energy Conversion System. All equipment, machinery and
structures used in connection with the conversion of wind energy to
electricity. This includes, but is not limited to, all transmission, storage,
collection and supply equipment, substations, network of cabling, transformers,
site-access and service roads, and machinery associated with its use. A wind
energy conversion facility may consist of one or more wind turbines.
   (u)   “WECS license.”  A license to construct and operate a Wind Energy
Conversion System issued by the Village in accordance with this chapter.
   (v)   “WECS setback.”  The distance measured at grade from the center of the
base of the tower to the nearest property line.
   (w)   “Wind turbine.”  Any electromechanical device that converts kinetic
energy of the wind into rotational energy to turn an electrical generator
shaft. Wind turbine facilities usually consist of a horizontal axis rotor,
nacelle and supporting tower. Both horizontal and vertical wind turbines are
covered by this chapter.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)

(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.08  DESIGN AND INSTALLATION.
   (a)   Design Safety Certification.
      (1)   WECS(s) shall conform to applicable industry standards, including
those of the American National Standards Institute (“ANSI”). Applicants shall
submit certificates of design compliance that equipment manufacturers have
obtained from Underwriters Laboratories (“UL”), Det Norske Veritas (“DNV”),
Germanischer Lloyd Wind Energie (“GL”), or an equivalent third party. The
provision of a design compliance certificate from any one of ANSI, UL, DNV or
GL will satisfy this requirement.
      (2)   Following the granting of siting approval(s) under this text, a
licensed Ohio professional engineer shall certify, as part of the building
permit application, that the foundation and tower design of the WECS is within
accepted professional standards, given local soil and climate conditions; it
being understood that an applicant may submit different building permit
applications hereunder in keeping with the project flexibility based on
equipment type to be used , it being further understood that any and all such
permit applications shall still be certified by a licensed Ohio professional
engineer as contemplated hereunder.
   (b)   Controls and Brakes.  All WECS shall be equipped with a redundant
braking system. This includes both aerodynamic overspeed controls (including
variable pitch, tip, and other similar systems) and mechanical brakes.
Mechanical brakes shall be operated in a failsafe mode. Stall regulations shall
not be considered a sufficient braking system for overspeed protection.
   (c)   Electrical Components.  All electrical components of the WECS shall
conform to applicable local, State, and national codes, and relevant national
and international standards (e.g. ANSI, UL and International Electrical
Commission).
   (d)   Color.  Towers and blades shall be painted white or gray, or other
non-reflective, unobtrusive color, subject to approval.
   (e)   Compliance with the Federal Aviation Administration.  The applicant
for the WECS shall comply with all applicable FAA requirements.

      (1)   A reasonably visible warning sign concerning voltage must be placed
at the base of all pad-mounted transformers and substations;
      (2)   Visible, reflective, colored objects, such as flags, reflectors, or
tape shall be placed on the anchor points of guy wires and along the guy wires
up to a total of 15 feet from the ground;
      (3)   A sign or posting no more than four square feet in area displaying
a toll-free telephone number, answered by a person 24 hours per day, seven days
a week, for emergency calls and informational inquiries shall be posted at the
entrance to the project and at the erected wind turbine generators. No turbine
generator tower or anemometer tower or site shall include any advertising
signage, but logos of the owner or operator or of the wind turbine generator
manufacturer shall not be considered “advertising” for the purpose of the text.
A copy of the position and size of the logo shall be included with the
conditional use application.
   (g)   Climb Prevention.  All WECS towers must be not climbable by designs
for the first 12 feet or protected by anti-climbing devices. For the purpose of
this text, a free-standing tubular tower which shall have a solid metal entry
door at the base with a door handle which is securable against unauthorized
entry by a heavy duty padlock, combination lock or any other such device, shall
be presumed to be not climbable by design. Other examples of anti-climbing
devices include but shall not be limited to safeguards such as fences with
locking portals at least six feet high or 12 feet vertically from the base of
any lattice WECS tower.
   (h)   Setbacks.  The Village also finds the setback of 750 feet set forth in
Ohio R.C. 4906.20 for the siting of a large wind turbine system is inadequate
to protect the health and welfare of the residents of the Village.  The Village
is requiring a setback of 2,640 feet from any occupied residence or business.
      (1)   The distance for the above setback shall be measured from the point
of the primary structure foundation closest to the WECS tower to the center of
the WECS tower foundation. In no case shall a WECS tower be located closer to a
primary structure than 1.1 times the WECS tower height;
      (2)   All WECS towers shall be set back a distance of at least 1.1 times
the WECS tower height from any public roads, third party transmission lines,
and communication towers;
      (3)   A waiver may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals if the
primary land owners and all affected adjacent property owners are in mutual
agreement. Any waiver of a setback requirement shall run with the land and be
recorded as part of the chain of title in the deed of the subject property. All
costs involved in creating the aforementioned waiver are to be incurred by all
affected property owners. This mutual agreement shall be filed with the Zoning
Officer/Village Administrator.
   (i)   Compliance with Additional Regulations.  Nothing in this text is
intended to preempt other applicable State and Federal laws and regulations.
   (j)   Use of Public Streets.  An applicant, owner or operator proposing to
use any street(s) in the Village for the purpose of transporting WECS or
substation parts must be granted permission by the Village Administrator/Zoning
Officer.
   (k)   Minimum Rotor or Wind Vane Clearance.  The lowest point of the arc
created by the rotating wind vanes or blades on a wind turbine generator shall
be no less than 15 feet, measured from the highest point of the terrain within
one blade radius from the base of the tower.
   (l)   Lighting.  It is the stated intention of this text to cede
jurisdiction over all matters relating to aviation obstruction hazard lighting
to the then-existing rules and regulations of the FAA at the time the project
is constructed and operating. Accordingly, there shall not be strobe lighting,
intermittent white lighting or other lighting fixtures affixed to the wind
turbine generators, unless expressly required by the FAA, and if so required,
the owner or operator shall affix only those lighting fixtures required by the
FAA. All tower lighting required by the FAA shall be mounted in strict
adherence to the then- existing FAA regulations for such lighting and no other
discretion or burden as to lighting of any kind affixed to the wind turbine
generators shall be placed on the owner or operator of the project by means of
this text.
   (m)   The Village will set a maximum noise level at 35 dB(A) measured at the
property line of adjoining parcels.
   (n)   Liability Insurance.  The owner or operator of the WECS(s) shall
maintain a current general liability policy covering bodily injury and property
damage with limits of at least ten million dollars ($10,000,000) per occurrence
and ten million dollars ($10,000,000) in the aggregate.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.09  VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   The Planning Commission will hear all information gathered in the
application process. If the application is denied, or if the WECS does not
comply with any portion of the Zoning Ordinances of the Village, the applicant
may appeal the decision, which will be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals. A
variance to the zoning regulations of the Mt. Gilead Codified Ordinances,
Chapters
1133 to
1163, may be provided by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.10  DECOMMISSION.
   Prior to receiving siting approval under this text, the Village and the
applicant, owner and/or operator must formulate a written decommissioning plan
to ensure that the WECS project is properly decommissioned. This plan shall
include:
   (a)   Provisions describing the triggering events for decommissioning the
WECS project which shall include the following language: Any wind turbine
generator or anemometer tower that is not operated a continuous period of 12
months shall be considered abandoned, unless due to documented maintenance or
electrical grid issues and written notice provided to the Village Solicitor,
and the owner or operator of such wind turbine generator or anemometer tower
shall remove the same within 180 days of receipt of notice from the Village, in
addition to removing the wind turbine generator, or anemometer tower to its
original condition prior to the location of the wind turbine generator or
anemometer tower. Any foundation associated with a wind generator or anemometer
tower shall be removed from the site to a depth which is at least 48 inches
below restored ground level and the site restored to its original state,
including the planting of any grasses or cover crops, which may have been
present prior to construction. All transmission equipment, buildings and fences
shall also be removed. Failure to remove an abandoned wind turbine generator or
anemometer tower within the 180-day period provided in this division, or in the
event that the owner or operator of the wind turbine generator or anemometer
tower is no longer financially capable, or fails to respond to mail sent to its
last address on file with the Village, shall be grounds for the Village to
remove the wind turbine generator or anemometer tower structure and all
associated equipment or appurtenances at the owner or operator's expense. The
Village may sell any salvageable material; deduct the balance due from the
surety bond, which the Village shall require;
   (b)   Provisions for the removal of structures, debris and cabling,
including those below the soil surface;
   (c)   Provisions for the restoration of the soil and vegetation;
   (d)   An estimate of the decommissioning costs certified by a licensed Ohio
professional engineer;
   (e)   Financial assurance in the form of a surety bond of at least twenty
thousand dollars ($20,000) for each tower, secured by the owner or operator,
for the purpose of adequately performing decommissioning or in an amount equal
to the Zoning Enforcement Officer/Village Administrator's certified estimate of
the decommissioning cost, whichever is greater.
   (f)   The Zoning Enforcement Officer/Village Administrator shall be notified
by the owner or operator as to the renewal of the surety bonds on an annual
basis.
   (g)   A provision that the terms of the decommissioning plan shall be
binding upon the owner or operator and any of their successors, assignees or
heirs.
   (h)   A provision that the Village shall have access to the site, pursuant
to reasonable notice, to effect or complete decommissioning.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.11  VIOLATIONS AND PENALTIES.
   (a)   It shall be unlawful to construct or operate any WECS or part thereof
in violation of any provision of this
Chapter 1165, a WECS license, or a WECS license agreement. Any person or
business entity who violates or fails to comply with any provision of this
chapter, WECS license or WECS license agreement shall, upon conviction thereof,
be subject to forfeitures of not less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) and
not more than two thousand dollars ($2,000), and shall pay all costs and
expenses of enforcement, including attorney and other fees incurred by the
Village. Each day a violation exists or continues shall constitute a separate
offense.
   (b)   The owner, officer or employee having control or supervision of the
Wind Energy Conversion System shall be charged with the responsibility of
complying with all aspects of this
Chapter 1165. If any of the conditions of this chapter are violated, the owner,
officer or employee shall be held personally responsible. The dissolution,
termination or bankruptcy of the business entity does not discharge the
responsibility of the owner, officer or employee.
   (c)   The Village Council shall retain continuing jurisdiction to modify,
suspend or revoke all Wind Energy Conversion System licenses. Such authority
shall be in addition to the Village's authority to prosecute violations and
take other enforcement action.
   (d)   Any resident of the Village or Village Official may file a written
complaint alleging that a WECS licensee has committed or is committing a
violation. The complaint will be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals, who
shall preliminarily review the complaint. The Board of Zoning Appeals may
request information from the holder of a WECS license, the complainant, and any
other person or entity to assist with its preliminary review. Following the
preliminary review the Board of Zoning Appeals may: a) dismiss the complaint;
b) refer the complaint to the Village Solicitor for prosecution; or c) Conduct
a hearing to determine whether the alleged violation(s) have occurred and what
remedial action shall be taken. Prior to such hearing, notice of the hearing
shall be given to the holder of the WECS license and the complainant, and in
accordance with the Sunshine Laws. The holder of the WECS license and the
complainant, and any other person, may appear at the hearing and may offer
testimony and other relevant evidence and may be represented by an attorney. 
If the Board of Zoning Appeals determines that a violation(s) has occurred, the
Board of Zoning Appeals may: a) impose conditions on the WECS licensee to the
extent reasonably necessary to discontinue the violations or avoid recurrence;
b) suspend the license until corrective actions have been taken; c) revoke the
license and direct decommissioning of the WECS if there is no reasonable
modification that can be made to the WECS to prevent further violations; d)
refer the matter to the Village Solicitor for prosecution; or e) take no
action. The written decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall be furnished
to the WECS licensee and to the complainant.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.12  SEPARABILITY.
   If any article, section, subsection, sentence, clause, provision or portion
of this chapter is for any reason held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any
decision of any court of competent jurisdiction, such holding shall not affect
the validity of any other section, subsection, clause, provision or portion of
this chapter which is not in itself invalid or unconstitutional.
(Ord. 1636.  Passed 4-19-10.)
1165.13  EXPIRATION.
   Unless the Village Council approves a different term based on an analysis of
the anticipated useful life of the WECS, a license issued under this chapter
shall expire 30 years after the date it is issued.

   The purposes of this chapter are to provide a number of performance
standards by which applications for development will be evaluated by the
Village and by which the actual performance of new and existing operations and
uses will be monitored by the Village for compliance. The purposes of these
performance standards are to protect the Village in general, and abutting and
neighboring landowners in particular, from any potential negative impacts that
uses may have on the physical environment and the quality of life currently
enjoyed by Mount Gilead.
(Ord. 1721. Passed 6-22-15.)
1166.02  APPLICABILITY.
   The Good Neighbor Standards shall be met by all new and existing uses
introduced into the Village. At the same time as any application is made for
any permits or approvals from the Zoning Inspector or the Planning Commission
or Council, the developer shall include a statement indicating compliance with
these standards. The Village Zoning Inspector must consider the degree to which
a new development will or will not comply with these standards before rendering
a decision on the application. Failure to meet the Good Neighbor Standards may
be grounds for delaying or rejecting an application.
(Ord. 1721. Passed 6-22-15.)
1166.03  WATER QUALITY.
   (a)   Objective.  Development or use of land within the Village of Mount
Gilead should not result in harm, pollution, or reduction of ground water.
   (b)   Standards.  All outdoor storage facilities for fuel, chemicals, or

   (b)   Standards.
      (1)   Emission of smoke, dust, dirt, fly ash, or other particulate
matter, or of noxious, toxic, or corrosive fumes, vapors, or gases in such
quantities as to be evident or perceptible at the property line of any lot on
which a use is conducted, or which could be injurious to human health, animals,
or vegetation; detrimental to the enjoyment of adjoining or nearby properties;
or which could soil or stain persons or property, at any point beyond the lot
line of the property creating that emission shall not be permitted.
      (2)   No land use or establishment shall be permitted to produce harmful,
offensive, or bothersome odors, scents, or aromas, (such as, but not limited
to, those produced by manufacturing processes, food preparation, food
processing, food sales, rendering, fermentation processes, decaying organic
matter, and/or incinerators) perceptible beyond that use’s lot line, either at
ground or other habitable elevation. The location and vertical height of all
exhaust fans, vents, chimneys, or any other sources discharging or emitting
smoke, fumes, gases, vapors, odors, scents, or aromas shall be indicated on all
plans for new development or uses including a description of the source of such
and the anticipated frequency and/or duration thereof.
(Ord. 1721. Passed 6-22-15.)
1166.05  GLARE.
   (a)   Objective.  Development or use of land in the Village of Mount Gilead
should not significantly increase or create glare caused by exterior lighting.
   (b)   Standards.
      (1)   The provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall be used in determining
compliance with these Good Neighbor Standards, however, a violation of the
provisions of the Zoning Ordinance shall be cited solely under the Zoning
Ordinance.
      (2)   Outdoor lighting shall be controlled in both height and intensity
to maintain the Village’s rural character. Therefore, no land use or
establishment shall be permitted to produce a strong, dazzling light or
reflection of that light beyond its lot lines onto neighboring properties, or

of any vehicle upon that town way. To achieve this, luminaries shall be
shielded to prevent light shining beyond the lot lines into neighboring
properties or public ways.
(Ord. 1721. Passed 6-22-15.)
1166.06  HEAT, RADIATION, ELECTRICAL OR MAGNETIC INTERFERENCE, AND EXPLOSIVE
HAZARD.
   (a)   Objective.  Development or use of land in the Village of Mount Gilead
shall not result in the creation of heat, radiation, electrical interference,
magnetic interference, or hazards of explosion or fire.
   (b)   Standard.  No use shall cause perceptible heat or radiation beyond the

GENERAL PROVISIONS
1319.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Mount Gilead, Ohio, does ordain as follows.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village has special flood hazard areas that are subject to periodic
inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base.
Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village as identified in Section
1319.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are
adopted:
   (a)   Flood Insurance Study Morrow County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Morrow County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective June 2, 2009.
   (b)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for establishment
of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year floodplain,
floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard, include any
hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a registered
professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved by the
Village as required by Section
1319.43.
   (c)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village of Mount Gilead, 72 West High Street,
Mount Gilead, Ohio 43338.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
(resolutions) including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In
the event of a conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance
(resolution), the more restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall
not impair any deed restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to
such interests shall also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
State statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal law, such State or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure” is a structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood” is the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to as the
one percent chance annual flood or 100-year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).
   (e)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
   (f)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real
estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or
storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.”  See “Lowest floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management),” issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no Federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” is the agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood or flooding” is a general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)” is usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
   (m)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)” is an official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones” are zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood;
base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE: Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99: Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded): Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded): Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation (FPE)” is the base flood elevation plus
zero feet of freeboard. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from any
authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical flood
elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway” is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard” means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure” means any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or prelirninarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis” is an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” is an official FEMA determination, by
letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary
and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs are broken down into the
following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a recreational vehicle. For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park,” as specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, means any tract of land upon which three or more manufactured
homes, used for habitation, are parked, either free of charge or for revenue
purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure
used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the park. A tract of land
that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are
for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the
lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured
homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government
authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)” is a Federal program
enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance
protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed to provide
an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of
repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods.
Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local communities
and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to all
development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction” means structures for which the start of
construction commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village's
Flood Insurance Rate Map, August 19, 1987, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, State college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or State community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle” is a vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect” is a person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer” is a person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor” is a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area,” also known as “areas of special flood
hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other Federal,
State or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction” means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure” means a walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or
gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement” means any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the start of
construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. 
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered new construction;
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
historic structure.
   (kk)   “Variance” means a grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to
be fully compliant with these regulations.

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1319.50 through
1319.55.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.31  SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
Federal, State, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
increased cost of compliance insurance claims.

Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or other
applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other authoritative
source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse, the following
standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.  Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Mount Gilead, specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an
agreement is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain
development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1319.29(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.

1319.53  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All application for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00), as set by the Village
Council.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Village Zoning Appeals Board shall
schedule and hold a public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of
general circulation in the community at least ten days before the date of the
hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing.
      (1)   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
         A.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
         B.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
         C.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
         D.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility
to the community.
         E.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
         F.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
         G.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
         H.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
         I.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
         J.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
         K.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
      (2)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property. 
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (3)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in paragraphs (c)(1)A. to K. hereof
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 1612.  Passed 3-2-09.)
1319.54  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented

   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.
   (d)   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition to
the appeal or variance.
   (e)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.

maximum wall sign area permitted for each building or structure.
            4.    One double-faced nameplate may be suspended from below an

architectural design.
      (4)    Notwithstanding paragraphs (a) (1) through (3) hereof, improper
maintenance, nonfunctional design, lack of amenities and unsightly appearance
of private and public properties may constitute a blightinginfluence on nearby
property; may significantly depreciate or hinder the increase of property
values in the vicinity; may impair the successful functioning of downtown Mt.
Gilead as a business center; and may create safety, fire and sanitation hazards

   (b)    These regulations are therefore intended to:
      (1)   Promote public health and safety in downtown Mt. Gilead by
improving standards of property maintenance.
      (2)   Preserve and enhance property values, the Village's tax base and
the marketability of property downtown.

center.
      (4)   Enhance the safety and comfort of shoppers, employees, and other
members of the public who frequent the downtown area.

conveniently located sites for parking outside the Downtown Commercial
District.
   (b)    Driveway Location.  To reduce safety hazards and disruption to both
pedestrians and motorists from pedestrian-vehicular conflicts and to retain the

parking shared by two or more uses under a written agreement approved by the
Village Law Director shallnot require special review use approval.

consider the general public need for parking in the immediate area, patterns of
usage of spaces by the use and its customers throughout the day and any
practical obstacles to shared parking at the location.

1327.19  DESIGN REVIEW CRITERIA.
   The Downtown Design Review Board shall consider the criteria in this section
when reviewing any action made subject to its review hereunder. These criteria
are guidelines for review purposes and not regulatory mandates or prohibitions.
   (a)    Maintenance.
      (1)    Maintenance-oriented materials.
         A.   New construction. To avoid the blighting effect of poorly
maintained properties without placing undue maintenance burdens on property
owners or occupants, building and landscaping materials and finishes utilized
in new construction or rehabilitation should be selected and used with regard
to theirdurability and ease of maintenance as well as their appearance.
Appropriate measures and devices should be utilized to protect such materials
and finishes against damage from the elements, neglect, vandalism or abuse.
         B.   Street furniture. Street furniture should be chosen for:
            1.   Durability; and
            2.   Resistance to vandalism and exposure to weather, children and
neglect; and
            3.   Removability to facilitate maintenance; and
            4.   Ease of cleaning and maintenance.
   Parts and materials of street furniture should be standardized and easily
replaceable whenever possible. Street furniture should not require frequent
painting. Paint and finishes, when required, should be durable, fade and chip-
resistant, easily cleanable and of a color that permits easy and hard-to-detect
touch-up work.
      (2)    Maintenance-oriented design.  Design of buildings and sites should
facilitate cleaning and the control of dirt and refuse. Design configurations
that tend to catch and accumulate debris, dirt and leaves should be avoided.
      (3)    Historic buildings.  Historic buildings should use the Secretary
of the Interior's standards as follows:
         A. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
         B.   The historic character of a property shall be retained and
preserved. The removal of historic materials or the alteration of features and
spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.
         C.   Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its
time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historic development,
such as adding conjectural features or architecturalelements from other
buildings, shall not be undertaken.
         D.   Most properties change over time; those changes that have
acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retainedand
preserved.
         E.   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or
examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be
preserved.
         F.   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
         G.   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials, shall not be used. The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.
         H.   Significant archeological resources affected by a project shall
be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.
         I.   New additions, exterior alterations or related new construction
shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new
work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the
massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic
integrity of the property and its environment.
         J.   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such a manner that, if removed in the future, theessential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.
   (b)    Street Furniture and Public Amenities.
      (1)   Comfort and convenience.  Downtown merchants and the Village
Government should encourage employees and shoppers to spend moretime downtown
by providing street furniture and public amenities designed to make Downtown
more comfortable and convenient. Particular items of street furniture should be
chosen or designed to maximize comfort and convenience for the downtown user.
      (2)   Compatibility with surroundings.  Street furniture should be
compatible in form, color and scale with its surroundings, including other
street furniture.
      (3)   Flexibility.  Street furniture should be flexible in use and
adaptable to changing needs. To permit adjustment to new conditions, benches
andseating areas should be removable and relocatable wherever possible,
consistent with the need to protect against theft and vandalism.
      (4)   Space efficiency.  Street furniture should make the minimum use of
scarce sidewalk and street space that is necessary for its function.
      (5)   Physical obstructions.  The amount, size, design and location of
street furniture should not unduly obstruct stairs, ramps, building entrancesor
exits, display windows, bus stops, loading zones or pedestrian circulation or
activity generally.
      (6)   Visual obstructions.  The amount, size, design and location of
street furniture should not unduly interfere with the visibility from the
streetor sidewalk of traffic and public information signs, of signage
identifying the location of a place of business, of store window displaysand of
awnings and canopies.
      (7)   Location of seating.  Public seating areas, where provided, should
be located immediately adjacent to areas of heavy pedestrian flow rather than
in less frequented areas.
      (8)   Seating in parks and plazas.  To encourage their maximum
utilization by the general public and to improve their security, all public and
private parks, mini-parks and open plazas downtown should provide seating
areas. Such areas may take the form of benches, chairs or ledges of a height,
depth and design that encourage sitting.
      (9)   Seating near food vending.  Where possible, public seating should
be located near restaurants and other food vending establishments offering
take-out fare to encourage their customers to linger in the retail area rather
than to take purchases back to the office or home.
      (10)   Seating to discourage sleeping.  To discourage the improper use of
public seating areas, bench seating and ledges suitable for seating should be
designed so as not to provide sufficient uninterrupted lengthsuitable for
reclining or sleeping purposes.
      (11)   Bicycle racks.  Bicycle racks should be installed by merchants or
the Village Government on sidewalks in selected locations where they willnot
disrupt pedestrian circulation but where they are also most likely to be used.
Racks should be more generously provided in public parks or open spaces in or
near downtown.
      (12)   Public conveniences.  To encourage shoppers to prolong their stay
in the downtown retail area, the Village Government and the Mt. Gilead Downtown
Association should establish public telephones that are at convenient
locations, that are easy to find and that are properly maintained.
      (13)   Outdoor eating areas.  Where existing sidewalk widths or widening
projects make it possible, restaurants should be permitted and encouraged to
add outdoor cafe-style seating to both increase businessand to add activity to
downtown streets.
   (c)    Facades and Display Windows.
      (1)   Store facades.  Street-level front facades of store buildings
should be designed to attract shoppers, to communicate the store's identity and
to provide a transition from the street to the store's interior in a way that
does not impair the functioning or value of nearby properties nordetract from
the retail environment of the block as a whole.
      (2)   Use of show windows.  Unless the nature of the business does not
lend itself thereto, ground floor show windows of retail businesses should be
used to attract the pedestrian into the store, either by displaying merchandise
or by revealing the interior of the store. Largewindow signage or opaque window
screening that conceals both merchandise and store interiors should be avoided.
      (3)   Show windows of vacant stores.  To mitigate the depressing effect
of dark, empty storefronts, owners of vacant street-level storefronts should
make display windows available on a temporary basis either to other merchants
for merchandise display or to arts or civic groups forthe display of art,
crafts, historical material or other items of public interest.
      (4)   Show window lighting.  Merchants and building owners should be
encouraged to keep illuminated signs and show windows lighted after business
hours to brighten the appearance of the street, advertise theirbusinesses and
increase security.
      (5)   Facade paint colors.  When a facade visible from the street or
other public area is repainted, a maximum of three colors of paint should
normally be used. The third color should serve solely as an accent in such
places as window frames, doors and cornices. Wherever possible, unpainted brick
should remain unpainted. It is strongly recommendedthat an architect or other
design professional be used to help choose colors. More information on color
selection is available upon request from the Board.
      (6)   Awnings and canopies.  To provide protection from the sun, rain and
snow for shoppers and to cool store interiors and minimize sun damage to window
displays, merchants should be encouraged to installattractive awnings or
canopies on front facades. Signage on such awnings or canopies is discouraged.
