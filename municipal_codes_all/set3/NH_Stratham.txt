Alarm Device or System Ordinance – Chapter 1-02
CHAPTER 1-02—ALARM DEVICE OR SYSTEM ORDINANCES
1-02-01 ALARMS: Business, residential, burglary, fire, medical emergency OR any emergency
alarm or device or system. Alarm System means any assembly of equipment and
devices, arranged to signal the presence of a hazard requiring urgent attention and to
which public safety personnel and equipment are expected to respond. All alarms
installed in the Town of Stratham shall conform to the standards set forth in the
following publications:
Revised Statutes Annotated 323-A as amended (Repealed 1985):
NFPA 101 (Life Safety Code)
The Fire Prevention Code (AIA)
NFPA 72, 73 (Fire Alarm Systems)
1-02-02 All individuals, firms or corporations seeking direct connection to the alarm receiving
station at the Stratham Police Department or Stratham Fire Department or other
receiving station shall contract with the approved alarm service for connection. The
service shall maintain and repair the receiver to the satisfaction of the Chief of Police or
Fire Chief. Individuals may install an alarm of their choice provided it is in
conformance with all sections of this ordinance. The Chief of Police or Fire Chief shall
sign an approval sheet for all new connections. Alarm owners must provide the
following information when installing new alarms:
1) Name, address, phone number, business phone
2) Exact location of building with alarm
3) A current list of individuals in charge of property in the absence of the
owner. This shall include name, address, and home and business phone of
at least three (3) persons who can be contacted in the event of an emergency.
Said persons shall have a key to gain entry and be capable of resetting the
alarm.
1-02-03 The Stratham Police Department will not be responsible for resetting any alarm. Keys
or other access material to any building will not be maintained at the receiving location.
1-02-04 PENALTY: In the event the individual alarm system malfunctions and the trouble is
determined to be in the individual alarm system, the alarm owner will be required to
have the appropriate repairs made within forty-eight (48) hours. Repeated malfunctions
due to disrepair will be treated as false alarms. False alarm means activation of an
alarm system through mechanical failure, accidental tripping, misoperation,
malfunction, misuse, or the neglect of the owner or lessee of an alarm system, or of his
employees or agents. Upon failure of the Police Department to find any evidence of
intrusion or other legitimate cause of activating an alarm system, a conclusive
presumption of false alarm will be made. False alarm shall not include alarms caused
by earthquakes, violent winds, malfunctions of telephone line circuits, or external
causes beyond the control of the owner or lessee of the alarm system.

a false alarm through the use of alarm reporting equipment. Any person violating the
provisions of this chapter and section shall be assessed a penalty of fifty dollars
($50.00) for each incident. False alarms, due to malfunction of equipment, shall be an
affirmative defense to this penalty. However, in the event an individual, firm or
corporation records three (3) or more false alarms in a thirty (30) day period, they shall
be assessed a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00) for each subsequent report. All imposed
or assessed penalties shall be paid within fourteen (14) calendar days inclusive of the
billing date of said offense. All assessed penalties shall be paid to the Town Clerk of
the Town of Stratham.
1-02-06 Any person violating the provisions of this chapter or the rules and regulations made
under the authority thereof, and who has not paid the assessed penalty(ies) for which he
is liable under Section 02-02, may be summonsed to appear before the District Court
and shall be liable to a penalty of not more than two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00).
1-02-07 The Chief of Police or Fire Chief reserves the right to order a disconnect and may
refuse to send public safety personnel and equipment for any alarm that is in disrepair,
is a habitual false alarm violator, or fails to meet any of the conditions of this
ordinance.

3.7 FLEXIBLE/MIXED USE DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (03/07)
3.7.1 Purpose.
This section provides for the redevelopment of the NH Community Technical College site,
which is a very unique property in Stratham. If no opportunity for change were provided
for within this ordinance, proposed reuses could be limited to state, federal or other
governmental institutional uses.
The purpose and goals of this section are to provide for the possible redevelopment of the
site within the following guidelines:
a. To encourage a mixed-use environment, which would allow opportunities to develop
or provide for the adaptive reuse of existing structures where flexible performance
standards would provide for the protection of abutting neighborhoods, surrounding
properties and uses.
b. To provide for limited commercial, office, and light industrial uses which are similar
in nature, and which improve employment opportunities and strengthen the economic
base of the town. Such activities should be sensitive to the natural environment, “Dark
Sky” lighting standards, adjacent residential areas and other community facilities.
c. To utilize compact village development guidelines, which would encourage the
creation of human-scale development with “Town Center” pedestrian friendly spaces,
centralized park areas and recreational opportunities.
d. To encourage any new development to meet energy efficiency standards and
sustainability practices.
In order to maintain protections for surrounding properties, development under this
ordinance may require more stringent buffer requirements for neighboring residential
zones and uses. Due to the sensitivity of the environment and potential proximity to
residential areas only specific alternative uses will be permitted.
3.7.2 Zone Defined.

Conditional Use Permit, Subdivision, Site Plan approval, or any should a violation of an
approved Development Plan or Conditional Use Permit occur, the Planning Board or the
Town Planner has the right to require the property owner to stop, remove, and/or mitigate
the violation, or seek the appropriate appeal process to gain compliance. (Rev. 3/17)
a. Review Process (Rev 3/17):
i. Projects that do not require a Conditional Use Permit shall be evaluated for compliance
with this ordinance by the TRC, and then be processed by the Planning Board as required
under the Subdivision and/or Site Plan Review Regulations of Stratham. Such applications
should follow the submission requirements of a Site Plan Review Application.

ii. For those development applications within the District that include a request for a
deviation from the requirements of this ordinance, a complete Site Plan Review
Application shall be accompanied with a Conditional Use Permit Application that
includes a narrative description of the deviation(s) and a site plan illustrating
proposed deviation from any requirement within this ordinance. Deviation from
the requirements of this Ordinance shall only be permitted by grant of a Conditional
Use Permit issued by the Planning Board. A Conditional Use Permit is a decision
that would permit deviation from or reduction in a specific provision(s) of this
Ordinance but that is otherwise generally consistent with the provisions of Section
3.8.3 Purpose and Intent (See 3.8.6 a. iii).
iii. The Planning Board shall have the authority to grant or deny a request for a
Conditional Use Permit, pursuant to the provisions of RSA 674:16 and RSA
674:21.A Conditional Use Permit, for relief from the requirements of this
Ordinance, after proper public notice and public hearing where the Planning Board
finds that an application complies with standards 1. and 2. below.
1. Consistent with the Gateway Business District Master Plan, including but not
limited to:
a. Both public and private buildings and landscaping shall contribute to the
physical definition of streetscapes and public spaces; and
b. Development shall adequately accommodate automobiles and emergency
vehicles, while respecting the pedestrian and the spatial form of public
spaces; and
c. Design of streets and buildings shall reinforce safe environments, but not at
the expense of accessibility and efficient traffic flow; and
d. Architecture and landscape design shall complement climate, topography,
community character, and building practice; and
e. Open space and public gathering places shall be provided as locations that
reinforce the identity and activity of the District and the community; and
f. New development and redevelopment shall be otherwise consistent with the
intent and purpose of this ordinance; and
g. Does not unduly impact adjacent properties and uses in the District.
2. Improves public safety within the District and/or in adjacent zoning districts;
or provides environmental and natural resource protection; or provides a
measureable public benefit (such as increased public space, open space or
public amenities).
iv. The granting or denial of a Conditional Use Permit by the Planning Board may be
appealed to the Superior Court, as provided for in RSA 677:15. A Planning Board
decision on the issuance of a Conditional Use Permit cannot be appealed to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment (RSA 676:5 iii).

3.8.7 Building and Site Design Standards:
a. Purpose:
In order to provide for harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development in the built
environment [RSA 674:44,II(b)], the TRC (refer to Section 3.8.6) and the Planning
Board will apply the following Building and Site Design Standards in its review of all
applications in the District.
b. Intent:
Maintaining the quality and character of the community is dependent upon the quality
and character of the architecture and development that is allowed to occur. Poorly
planned and executed development detracts from the character and function of the built
environment, while well-planned development enhances community character, quality
of life, and value of the surrounding properties and the community overall.
Design standards are a tool to help guide development and redevelopment assuring that
community priorities are an integral part of the design process. Design Standards,
implemented as part of the application review and approval process, are a set of design
principles that offer a positive direction for building and site level design. The
guidelines and interpretations are based upon maintaining and enhancing the character
of the community. They are not intended to specify any particular architecture or style.
Design Standards address a wide range of design issues including such elements as:
pedestrian and traffic circulation, building mass and scale, architectural details, signs,
landscaping, lighting, open space, and natural features. When integrated, these
elements will create a project that is functional, attractive, and an asset to the
community.
c. Building and Site Design Evaluation:
The evaluation of the following factors will inform the TRC and the Planning Board’s
decisions on whether proposed site and building designs achieve the purpose and intent
of these Design Standards and of this Ordinance. The Planning Board shall develop a
GCBD guidance document to further illustrate and provide details of the design
standards stated below. This document shall be utilized by applicants when designing
projects within the District.
i. Within a development project, site design elements should be compatible with
small New England Village character and the town’s agricultural history.
ii. Building architecture should demonstrate the cohesive planning of the development
and present a clearly identifiable, attractive design feature and appearance
throughout. It is not intended that buildings be totally uniform in appearance or
that designers and developers be restricted in their creativity. Rather, cohesion, and
identity can be demonstrated in harmonious building style, scale or mass; consistent
use of facade materials; similar ground level detailing, color or signage; consistency
in functional systems such as roadway or pedestrian way surfaces, signage, or
landscaping; public amenities; the framing of outdoor open space and linkages, or
a clear conveyance in the importance of various buildings and features on the site.
iii. Building architecture should be designed to provide an attractive appearance.
Franchise or corporate style architecture and/or highly contrasting color schemes
are strongly discouraged. If proposed, such building styles should be substantially
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
34
modified to create a project that complements the small New England Village
character. All architectural details should be related to an overall architectural
design approach or theme.
iv. Diversity of architectural design is encouraged. Buildings that are characteristic of
a historic period are encouraged, particularly if a building style or the site is
historically appropriate for the community or necessary for architectural harmony.
v. Multiple buildings on the same site should be designed to create a cohesive visual
relationship, as well as efficient circulation and access for pedestrians and vehicles.
Accessory buildings should be designed to complement the primary building and/or
use on the site in design and material expression.
vi. Building placement should take best advantage of solar orientation, climatic and
other environmental conditions, should encourage safety and use of adjacent public
spaces and public open spaces, and should minimize the impact of activity and light
upon and from the project.
vii. Buildings adjacent to public open space should generally be oriented to that space,
with access to the building opening onto the public open space.
viii. Implementation of Low Impact Development techniques is strongly encouraged,
including, but not limited to, storm water management practices, alternative
surfacing materials, building and site design elements, and landscaping features.
ix. The practice of creating structures and using processes that are environmentally
responsible and resource-efficient throughout a building's life-cycle from siting to
design, construction, operation, maintenance, renovation, and deconstruction are
strongly encouraged.
x. All electrical utilities shall be located underground.
d. Street and Streetscape Standards:
i. Thoroughfare intersections and on-street parking shall be setback a minimum of
100 feet from Portsmouth Avenue.
ii. In the Central Zone, thoroughfares shall be laid out in a grid-like pattern and may
be composed of angular, rectangular, or square configurations that define blocks.
iii. Thoroughfares shall provide the following streetscape elements: sidewalks,
pedestrian crossings, planting strips, street trees, and lighting. Bike lanes shall be
provided on Boulevards, Avenues, and Streets shown on the Regulating Plan and
as detailed in Section 3.8.8.b and Section 3.8.8.c for additional standards for
required and recommended streetscape elements.
iv. Thoroughfares that incorporate commons and squares are encouraged to provide
public parks and spaces and add visual form and interest to the development.
Roundabouts may also be incorporated when necessary to enhance traffic flow and
safety.
v. Other new thoroughfares shall be aligned as closely as possible at right angles to
the roadway network shown on the Regulating Plan and spaced according to the
needs of the development serviced, traffic demand and safety.
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
35
e. Landscaping Standards:
The following landscaping standards shall apply to all development:
i. Following are requirements for implementation of buffers:
1. A minimum 30-foot vegetated buffer shall be provided between proposed
development and adjacent residential zoning districts outside the GCBD;
2. Street trees and other plantings shall be placed within the building setback on
the lot or right of way of Portsmouth Avenue;
3. A 30-foot vegetated buffer where a residential use abuts a non-residential use
or a mixed-use development in the Outer Zone.
ii. Buffers shall be established or maintained at a density that attenuates year round the
impact of activity and light on adjacent properties.
iii. Use of native species of trees, shrubs, groundcover, and decorative plants in all
landscaping is strongly encouraged.
iv. A landscaping plan, including a maintenance plan and agreement, shall be approved
as part of the review and approval process as stated in the Site Plan Review (Section
V.5.2) and Subdivision Regulations.
f. Lighting Standards:
i. Street, building and site lighting shall not adversely impact surrounding uses and
residential projects, and be designed with no light spilling or reflecting into adjacent
properties and with protection of the night sky. Such lighting shall not blink, flash,
oscillate, or be of unusually high intensity of brightness, except for purposes of
providing emergency services or to protect public safety.
ii. Energy efficient exterior lighting and streetlights shall be provided.
iii. Lighting of the site shall be adequate at ground level for the protection and safety
of the public in regard to pedestrian access and vehicular circulation. This shall
include, but not be limited to sidewalks, crossings, parking areas, and other public
spaces.
iv. Refer to additional lighting requirements in Section 3.8.8, Tables b.5 and c.6.
v. Unless otherwise stated, lighting shall comply with the standards of the Site Plan
Review Regulations, Section V.5.8.
g. Parking Standards:
i. On-street parking shall provide short-term parking for patrons of shops and
businesses. On street parking to service residential areas is recommended.
ii. Parking for mixed use developments shall provide long term and shared parking by
multiple uses and users.
iii. Delivery and other service related areas for mixed use and non-residential uses can
be located at the front, rear, or sides of buildings, or within designated portions of
parking areas. Loading docks and service areas shall not face a public frontage.
Delivery and service vehicles are encouraged to utilize rear alleys for building
access.
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
36
iv. Parking structures shall comply with the dimensional requirements and design
standards of principal buildings. Below ground and multi-story parking structures
are encouraged.
v. Refer to additional parking requirements in Section 3.8.8, Tables b.6 and c.7.
vi. Parking in the District shall comply with the requirements of Section V.5.9 of the
Site Plan Regulations.

permitted uses may include passive, non-motorized recreation; natural resource
management and research; and commercial agriculture and forestry.
Access
All development shall provide public access to designated open space within the
District.
Location and Connectivity
Lands designated as open space shall be connected preferably by being
contiguous from one lot to another lot or within a development, or secondarily
by walking paths, designated public spaces or sidewalks. The goal of locating
open space is to create a contiguous greenway that provides pedestrians and
bicyclists opportunity to move throughout the District. The open space
greenway will provide an alternative to vehicle travel for both residents and
visitors.
Character and Features
Existing natural areas may be preserved and maintained as open space. Open
space may also be newly established through the creation of parks, gardens,
ponds and other natural areas and/or features. Open space shall be maintained
or established to provide opportunity for the public – both residents and visitors
- to gather, recreate outdoors, and enjoy scenic views and landscapes.
3.8.9 Architectural and Site Design Standards
a. Building Exterior Features:
i. Building facades shall be compatible in scale, mass, and form with adjacent
structures and the development pattern of the surrounding area (assuming the
adjacent structures are generally in compliance with these design standards).
ii. Exterior building design and detail on all elevations shall be coordinated with
regard to color, types of materials, number of materials, architectural form, and
detailing to achieve harmony and continuity of design.
iii. Paint colors, excluding signage and awnings, shall be limited to a reasonable
number and range of palette to achieve consistency of style and character with
adjacent development.
iv. Where appropriate, architectural details and richly detailed designs are
encouraged to provide variation and creative designs. All features and details
should be of a style consistent with the overall design scheme and in proportion
with the building and adjacent structures.

The TRC shall process applications for development within the District for the purpose of
determining compliance with the provisions of the Ordinance. The TRC may consult with
other committees, commissions, and professionals for review and comment on applications
within the District. Any cost associated with professional review shall be the responsibility of
the applicant. The TRC review of any application shall be deemed equivalent to a Preliminary
Consultation with the Planning Board, however, applicants may also submit for Preliminary
Consultation.
Should any construction, site work, or development be commenced without an approved

Development Plan or Conditional Use Permit occur, the Planning Board or the Town Planner
has the right to require the property owner to stop, remove, and/or mitigate the violation, or
seek the appropriate appeal process to gain compliance. (Rev. 3/18)
a. Review Process (Rev 3/18):
i. Projects that do not require a Conditional Use Permit shall be evaluated for compliance
with this ordinance by the TRC, and then be processed by the Planning Board as required
under the Subdivision and/or Site Plan Review Regulations of Stratham. Such applications
should follow the submission requirements of a Site Plan Review Application.
ii. For those development applications within the District that include a request for a deviation
from the requirements of this ordinance, a complete Site Plan Review Application shall be
accompanied with a Conditional Use Permit Application that includes a narrative
description of the deviation(s) and a site plan illustrating proposed deviation from any
requirement within this ordinance. Deviation from the requirements of this Ordinance shall
only be permitted by grant of a Conditional Use Permit issued by the Planning Board. A
Conditional Use Permit is a decision that would permit deviation from or reduction in a
specific provision(s) of this Ordinance but that is otherwise generally consistent with the
provisions of Section 3.8.3 Purpose and Intent (See 3.8.6 a. iii).

3.9.7 Building and Site Design Standards:
a. Purpose:
In order to provide for harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development in the built
environment [RSA 674:44,II(b)], the Technical Review Committee (refer to Section 3.9.6) and
the Planning Board will apply the following Building and Site Design Standards in its review
of all applications in the District.
b. Intent:
i. Maintaining the quality and character of the Town Center is dependent upon the quality
and character of the architecture and development that is allowed to occur. Poorly planned
and executed development detracts from the character and function of the built
environment, while well-planned development enhances community character, quality of
life, and value of the surrounding properties and the community overall.
ii. Design standards are a tool to help guide development and redevelopment assuring that
community priorities are an integral part of the design process. Design Standards,
implemented as part of the application review and approval process, are a set of design
principles that offer a positive direction for building and site level design. The guidelines
and interpretations are based upon maintaining and enhancing the character of the Town
Center.
iii. Design Standards address a wide range of design issues including such elements as:
pedestrian and traffic circulation, building mass and scale, architectural details and building
materials, signs, landscaping, lighting, open space, and natural features. When integrated,
these elements will create a project that is functional, attractive, and an asset to the
community.
c. Building and Site Design Evaluation:
The evaluation of the following factors will inform the Technical Review Committee and the
Planning Board’s decisions on whether proposed site and building designs achieve the purpose
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
58
and intent of these Design Standards and of this Ordinance. The Planning Board shall develop
a Town Center District guidance document to further illustrate and provide details of the design
standards stated below. This document shall be utilized by applicants when designing projects
within the District.
i. The Town Center District shall be designed in a pattern of interconnecting streets and
alleys, defined by buildings, street furniture, landscaping, pedestrian ways, and
sidewalks. The layout should be suited to the existing topography and other natural and/or
historic features of the area.
ii. Within a development project, site design elements should be compatible with a
traditional New England Village character and the Town Center’s heritage and historic
function within the community.
iii. Building architecture should demonstrate the cohesive planning of the development and
present a clearly identifiable, attractive design feature and appearance throughout. It is
not intended that buildings be totally uniform in appearance or that designers and
developers be restricted in their creativity. Rather, cohesion and identity can be
demonstrated in harmonious building style, scale or mass; consistent use of facade
materials; similar ground level detailing, color or signage; consistency in functional
systems such as roadway or pedestrian way surfaces, signage, or landscaping; public
amenities; the framing of outdoor open space and linkages, or a clear conveyance in the
importance of various buildings and features on the site.
iv. Building architecture should be designed to provide an attractive appearance. Franchise
or corporate style architecture and/or highly contrasting color schemes are strongly
discouraged. If proposed, such building styles should be substantially modified to create
a project that complements the traditional New England Village character. All
architectural details should be related to an overall architectural design approach or
theme.
v. Diversity of architectural design, massing, scale, context, and fenestration is encouraged.
Buildings that are characteristic of a historic period are encouraged, particularly if a
building style or the site is historically appropriate for the Town Center or necessary for
architectural harmony.
vi. The historic character of building/structures will be retained and preserved. The removal
of distinctive materials or alteration of features will be avoided. Further, new additions,
exterior alterations, or related new construction will not destroy historic materials,
features, and spatial relationships that characterize historically significant structures. The
new work shall be differentiated from the old and will be compatible with the historic
materials, features, size, scale and proportion, and massing to protect the integrity of the
property and its environment.
vii. Multiple buildings on the same site and attached buildings should be designed to create
a cohesive visual relationship, as well as efficient circulation and access for pedestrians
and vehicles. Accessory buildings should be designed to complement the primary
building and/or use on the site in design and material expression.
viii. Building placement should take best advantage of solar orientation, climatic and other
environmental conditions, should encourage safety and use of adjacent public spaces and
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
59
public open spaces, and should minimize the impact of activity and light upon and from
the project.
ix. Buildings adjacent to public open space should generally be oriented to that space, with

Any non-conforming structure which is completely or substantially destroyed by casualty
loss may be replaced with a similar structure which has the same building footprint
dimensions and meets the setbacks of the previously existing structure. The structure may
be rebuilt provided such construction is started within one year of the casualty loss and
completed within two years of the casualty loss. The provisions of the Town of Stratham
Building Code, as amended, shall apply to any reconstruction.
5.1.2 Expansion of Non-Conforming Uses: (Rev. 3/15)
Except as noted below, an expansion of a non-conforming use is prohibited except by

not have a substantially different impact on the neighborhood.
A variance is not required for an expansion of a non-conforming use within the Gateway
Commercial Business District or Town Center District provided that the total area utilized
for the expansion of the non-conforming use does not exceed 10% of the area legally
utilized as of the date the use became non-conforming.

District or Town Center District provided that the footprint utilized for the expansion of
the non-conforming structure does not exceed 20% of the gross floor area of the existing
structure legally utilized as of the date the structure became non-conforming up to a
maximum of 5,000 square feet, does not violate dimensional requirements, and must be an
accessory or ancillary use, and be attached to the existing non-conforming structure.
The Board must find the following factors to exist before issuing such a special exception:
a. The proposed expansion must intrude no further into any setback area than does the
existing structure;
b. The expansion must have no further adverse impact on the view, light, and air of any
abutter;

d. The expansion must not impede existing rights of access or egress;
e. That portion of the proposed expansion, which will intrude into the setback must, in no
event, exceed the footprint square footage of that portion of the structure which
presently intrudes into the setback, regardless of the number of applications made over
time under this subsection;
f. In the event the non-conforming structure contains a commercial use, there must be no
adverse impact on access, traffic, parking, lighting, or other safety or visibility features
of the existing structure;
g. A special exception under this subsection may be granted only as to expansions into
the side, front, and rear setbacks, and is not available for expansions which violate
height restrictions of this ordinance.
5.1.4 Discontinuance Of:

without compliance with the Zoning Ordinance or, alternately, without a variance from the
Zoning Board of Adjustment. Voluntary abandonment shall be evidenced by either of the
following:
a. Discontinuance of the occupancy or nonconforming use for twelve consecutive months
with no ongoing attempts to sell or lease the property for its non-conforming use; or:
b. Failure to resume the nonconforming use within eighteen months, even though there

Ordinance may continue in their present use. These uses shall run with the land and may
be transferred by sale or lease by present owner to future owners or lessees, subject to the
other terms of this Ordinance, which limit such non-conforming uses.
All new uses, changes of uses, expansion of uses or resumption of uses previously
discontinued shall not be permitted until the property owner or authorized lessee has first
made application to the Town of Stratham Code Enforcement Officer for an administrative
decision seeking a determination whether a permit is required for such new, change,
expansion or resumption of the non-conforming use or non-conforming structure under the

7.8 GENERAL STANDARDS AND CRITERIA FOR SIGNS
The regulations in this section specify the area and heights of signs that are allowed within
the Town and which require a permit.
a. Measurement and Calculation of Area:
i. Area of Freestanding Signs:
1. Sign face area is calculated as the total area within the smallest square, circle,
rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme
limits of the writing, representation, emblem, or other display together with any
material or color forming an integral part of the background of the display or
used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop, background or structure against
which it is placed. Areas of supporting framework shall be excluded from this
calculation up to the amount of 35% of the total area as calculated above. All
supporting framework, bracing, or decoration in excess of the 35% limit shall
be deemed part of computation of the maximum aggregate area.
2. The area of one side of a double-faced sign shall be regarded as the total area
of the sign provided that such sign faces are either parallel or at an angle of
thirty (30) degrees or less to each other. If the sides are of unequal area, the
larger shall determine the area.
ii. Area of Wall/Building Signs:
1. The sign face area of signs attached or affixed to buildings or other structures
shall include all lettering, designs, or symbols, together with the background,
whether open or enclosed, upon which they are displayed. When signs are
incorporated into canopies or awnings, the entire panel containing the sign copy
is counted as the sign face area.
2. Where a sign consists of individual letters or symbols attached, painted or
applied to a building, wall or window, without any distinguishing border, panel
or background, the area shall be considered to be the smallest rectangle,
triangle, or circle encompassing all the letters and symbols.
3. In no case can the additional surrounding background area exceed the area of
the copy. For the purpose of this section, the permitted background area is the
total area between the lintel bar and the parapet on a one (1) story building or
between the lintel bar and the floor level of the floor above on a multi-story
building
iii. Sign Height for Freestanding Signs:
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019

The height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance from the
elevation of the nearest travel lane edge of pavement to the highest attached
component of the sign.
b. Signage Standards.
Design, color, materials, size, and placement are all important in creating signs that are
architecturally attractive and integrated into the overall site design. Signs that are
compatible with the surroundings and effectively communicate a message will promote
a quality visual environment. The following design standards will be used as a basis
for review of sign permits and the management of signs:
i. General Standards.
1. Design signs in harmony with the style and character of the development and
as an integral design component of the building architecture, building materials,
landscaping, and overall site development.
2. Signs should be clear, informative to the public and should weather well.
3. All signs shall be maintained in good repair, including the display surface,
which shall be kept neatly painted or posted.
4. Sign letters and materials should be professionally designed and fabricated.
5. Exposed conduit and tubing is prohibited. All power supplies and other
equipment shall be concealed.
6. The exposed back of all signs visible to the public shall be suitably finished and
maintained.
ii. Placement:
1. Signs should be generally free of obstructions when viewed from different
angles. However, trees or other landscaping that grows to a point that it
obstructs the view of a sign or makes it illegible shall not be grounds for
removal or trimming of the plant(s).
2. The physical placement of signs on a building shall be as important as the sign
composition itself. To maximize the effectiveness of signs and a building’s
architecture, every sign located on a building shall be required to be an integral
part of the building.
3. Signs shall be located with respect to the basic architectural framework of the
building, so as not to obscure the primary elements (door and window openings
and decorative facade treatments) of a building’s framework.
iii. Sign composition.
The visual style of a sign is determined by the relationship of its lettering, colors,
lighting, and material used. The design standards set forth herein constitute general
design criteria to be followed when determining conformity with the Ordinance.
iv. Lettering:
1. No more than two (2) lettering styles shall be permitted per sign.
2. Letters may be attached to the building facade.
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
110
3. Light-colored letters on a dark background are preferred. Dark letters on a light
background shall only be permitted if it complements the building's color
composition.
4. Lettering and signboards shall be located so as not to obstruct architectural
detailing on the building face.
5. Product trademarks are discouraged; however, trade signs (e.g., a shoe for a
cobbler, a mortar and pestle for a druggist) are preferred.
6. Letter styles shall be limited to the classic genre, i.e., Copper plate Gothic,
Times, Franklin Gothic, Benton, Clarendon, Haas Helvetica, Folio Caravelle
Medium, Windsor, and Times Roman.
7. The size of the lettering shall be in proportion to both the sign configuration
and the building.
v. Color:
1. No more than three (3) colors are preferred, including black/white. Lettering
shall preferably be one (1) color.
2. Colors used in signage should relate to the color composition of the building
material and be compatible with them.
3. The determination of sign color must relate to the degree of contrast between
the sign lettering and sign background.
vi. Material:
1. Traditional materials, such as wood, glass, brass, bronze, aluminum, or iron are
preferred for the framework of a sign. The use of plastic, aluminum and vinyl
will only be permitted if styled and composed to imitate wood or iron.
2. Wooden signs shall be constructed of dense, clear or finely grained wood that
adapts to engraving/carving and paint or stain. Ordinary plywood will not
withstand exposure; therefore, only overlay, exterior or marine plywood shall
be permitted.
vii. Sign Illumination:
1. The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that
will create glare or other negative impact on residential properties in direct line
of sight to the sign.
2. Whenever indirect lighting fixtures are used (fluorescent or incandescent), care
shall be taken to properly shield the light source to prevent glare from spilling
over into residential areas and any public right-of-way.
3. Internally illuminated plastic box “canned” signs are discouraged. Individually
illuminated channel letters are preferred.
4. Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights, or other illumination
devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness, or color.
5. Light sources shall utilize energy efficient fixtures to the greatest extent
possible.

SECTION VIII: RESIDENTIAL OPEN SPACE CLUSTER DEVELOPMENT
(REV. 3/04, Rev. 3/10, 3/13)
BY CONDITIONAL-USE PERMIT
8.1 AUTHORITY
Pursuant to RSA 674:21, the Planning Board is hereby authorized to grant a Conditional
Use Permit to allow for a Residential Open Space Cluster Development in accordance with
the restrictions and requirements of this section. The Planning Board is further authorized
to adopt amendments to the Subdivision Regulations in order to administer the
requirements of this ordinance.
8.2 PURPOSE
The Residential Open Space Cluster development provisions provides applicants with an
alternative development approach intended to promote flexibility and innovation in land
planning that are not specifically permitted in the current zoning ordinance. The provisions
are intended to encourage environmentally sound planning, conserve open space, retain
and protect important natural and cultural features, and provide for efficient use of land
and community services to advance the goals stated in the master plan.
Within this context, these regulations established are intended to be a minimum
consideration of allowable impacts. Each tract of land possesses different, unique
development characteristics and limitations, and the Residential Open Space Cluster
Development uses allowed on any particular tract will be a function of innovative land
planning and subdivision design interacting with the special characteristics and limitations
of the site.
8.3 OBJECTIVES
The Planning Board shall consider the following objectives and balance them accordingly
during the review of individual applications.
a. Maintain and preserve the rural character of the Town of Stratham by allowing an
alternative residential development option which preserves large areas of open space,
provides for visual buffers from existing roads and residential development, and
permits farming opportunities on parcels of open space.
b. To create a contiguous network of open spaces or “greenways” throughout the Town
by linking the common open spaces within the subdivision, to open space on adjoining
lands wherever possible, and as particularly found in the Stratham Master Plan
designated and referred to as the Stratham ‘S’ on Map FLU-2.
c. To provide for connected corridors of open land throughout Town for preservation of
habitat, environmental resources, and public enjoyment.
d. To preserve those areas of the site that have the highest ecological value, including, for
example, wildlife habitat, e.g., large unfragmented blocks of undeveloped land, areas
of highest condition identified based on NH Fish and Game’s Wildlife Action Plan,
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
120
and water resources, e.g., drinking water supply areas and watersheds, wetlands,
streams and rivers.
e. Provide for a diversity of housing types, opportunities, and styles.
f. To locate buildings and structures on those portions of the site that are the most
appropriate for development and avoiding developing in areas ill-suited for
development, including, for example, areas with poor soil conditions, a high water
table, that are subject to frequent flooding or that have excessively steep slopes.
g. Encourage flexible road design that will contribute to and enhance a rural atmosphere
and maintain minimal safety design.
h. As part of an alternative for residential development, to require the clustering of homes
in a manner that includes proximity in physical location while minimizing confusion
over issues of property ownership.
8.4 DEFINITIONS
The following definitions specifically apply to this Section of the Zoning Ordinance:
a. Buffer: Land area within which adequate vegetation is maintained or provided to
visibly separate or screen one use from another and/or to minimize potentially negative
impacts on surrounding areas, e.g., shield or block noise, light or other nuisances,
reduce water pollution. Also known as a “vegetated buffer.”
b. Buildable Area. Land area of a parcel excluding non-buildable area.
c. Buildable Lot. The smallest lot area established by the zoning ordinance on which a
use or structure may be located in a particular district.
d. Common Area. Any parcel or area of land and/or area of water set aside as a result of
a residential open space cluster plan. The common area is designed for the benefit and
enjoyment of the residents of a residential open space cluster development. These areas
may contain accessory structures and improvements necessary and appropriate for the
educational, recreational, cultural, social or other noncommercial/ nonresidential / nonindustrial
uses, plus any utility services utilized by the owners of the common area.
e. Conservation Land. Land given to a public body dedicated to conservation of forests,
park land, etc., or to a private conservation trust, with the intent of preserving in its
original ecological condition, safeguarding water supplies, or diminishing flood
danger.
f. Mandatory Home Association. A private non-profit corporation, association, or other
nonprofit legal entity established by the developer for the benefit and enjoyment of the
residents of the Cluster Development. Membership in said association shall be
mandatory for property owners and made a required covenant in any deed issued or
passed. It shall provide voting and use rights in the common area when applicable and
may charge dues to cover expenses, which may include tax liabilities of the common
area, recreational or utility facilities. Articles of Association or Incorporation must be
acceptable to the Planning Board and by the Town Counsel and any other municipal,
county, state agency, body, commission or department required by law to approve of
the same.
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
121
g. Non-buildable Area. Land area that cannot be counted toward the minimum lot size
under a conventional subdivision, including areas with the following characteristics:
wetlands or wetland soils as defined by RSA 482-A: 2, X; slopes greater than 25
percent; submerged areas; utility rights-of way; land area within the 100-year
floodplain; or land that is restricted from development by covenant, easement or other
restriction.
h. Open Space Cluster Subdivision. An alternative form of residential development
where, instead of subdividing an entire tract into lots of conventional size, a similar
number of housing units are arranged on lots of reduced dimensions, with the remaining
area of the parcel permanently protected as designated open space. Also referred to as
“conservation subdivision.”
i. Open Space Easement. Land whose development rights have been legally restricted,
either by deed or by public purchase of those rights. The easement may be so worded
as to permit or restrict public access, to allow or disallow recreational development,
and similar provisions. Easements are tied to the title of the land, regardless of its
subsequent ownership.
j. Public Open Land. Land purchased by or given to the Town of Stratham for parks,
playgrounds, or an undeveloped open space, generally with the intention of making it
accessible for public use.
8.5 STRICT ADHERANCE
To these provisions shall not be construed as establishing a legal right to a conditional use
permit for a cluster development. Those who wish to pursue their “development rights” to
a certain use or development of land should consider developing their land with the
permitted, conventional subdivision approaches, or through the variance procedure as
provided for by New Hampshire law.
8.6 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT
All Residential Open Space Cluster Developments shall obtain a Conditional Use Permit
from the Planning Board subject to Section 3.6 Additional Notes. The Conditional Use
Permit is meant to provide flexibility, minimize adverse impacts, and allow the Board to
participate jointly with the applicant to prepare a development that is consistent with this

154
15.5 PLANNING BOARD MONITORING
It is the responsibility of the Planning Board to monitor growth in the Town and to report
on the following:
15.5.1 Annual Reporting:
a. The Planning Board will by January 31st of each year report on the total number of
dwelling units existing at the end of its previous calendar year. Existing units means
all those units previously constructed and occupied plus those units constructed and
from which Certificates of Occupancy were issued in the reporting year. In the same
report, the Planning Board shall report on the status, as appropriate, of any phasing
requirements or permit limitations in force in the reporting period.
b. The Planning Board will by January 31st of each year report also report on the
“indicators of growth impact” as determined in 15.4. This report shall indicate which
growth indicators have been triggered.
15.5.2 Periodic Reporting: The Planning Board may at any time it determines it appropriate or
necessary, issue written reports on the status of growth activity in the Town covering such
topics as the number of dwelling units or lots being proposed for approval, or for which
building permits are being sought, the condition and capacity of any municipal or school
facility, the tax burden existing or anticipated on the Town's residents and/or any other
topic affecting or related to the growth or finances of the Town.
15.5.3 Notice of Growth Impact: The Planning Board may at any time issue a Notice of Growth
Impact, if it has determined, through 15.5.1 or 15.5.2 that any of the conditions in 15.4
exist. Said Notice would include a statement of whether those conditions could result in
either 15.6 Phasing or 15.7 Permit Limitations.
Pursuant to the monitoring in 15.5.1, 15.5.2, or 15.5.3, the Planning Board shall make
appropriate findings of fact, make recommendations for action, or take actions provided
for in Section XV of the Zoning Ordinance as a result of its monitoring and reporting
responsibilities.
15.6 PHASING OF DEVELOPMENTS
If the Planning Board, through its monitoring, finds that indicator 15.4 a., b., c., d., or e.
has occurred, then the Planning Board may at its discretion issue a Notice of Growth Impact
in conformance with 15.5.3 to the Board of Selectmen, the Building Inspector, and the
general public by posting a notice in the Town Hall. The phasing of future residential
developments, as provided in RSA 674:21, is to prevent a strain on municipal services and
therefore, to provide for orderly growth in Town. Phasing may be implemented as
provided below:
15.6.1 Phasing Required: The Planning Board may require the phasing of a development for a
period up to or less than five years for a project which is proposed to have 50 dwelling
units (lots) or less. For a project larger than 50 units or lots, the Planning Board may require
a longer or shorter period of phasing based on the size of the project and the potential
impact of the number or type of units on the municipal services of the Town. The Planning
Board shall make appropriate findings of fact to substantiate the need, time, and limit for
required phasing based on the size of the project and the potential impact from the number
or type of units on municipal services.
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
155
15.6.2 Effect of Phasing: Once a phasing plan has been approved by the Planning Board, the
project shall not be affected by any permit limitations subsequently enacted under the
provisions of Section 15.8.4 of this Ordinance, provided that the developer secures permits
for and begins substantial construction on the project on the units in each yearly phase. In
the event that substantial construction is not undertaken in any yearly phase, then the
vesting of that phase shall be forfeited and the developer shall be subject to any limitations
imposed by 15.8.4. For the purpose of this Section, substantial construction shall mean
either (a) all dwelling units in that phase are constructed to a weather tight condition or (b)
50 percent of all dwelling units in that phase are completed and a Certificate of Occupancy
has been given.
15.6.3 Termination of Phasing: The above constraints shall be removed when the Planning Board
determines in its 15.5 monitoring procedures that phasing is no longer necessary.
15.7 LIMITING THE ISSUANCE OF PERMITS
If the Planning Board finds through its monitoring that indicator 15.4 either a., b., c., d., or
e., plus one or more of indicators f. or g. has occurred, then the Planning Board may at its
discretion issue a Notice of Growth Impact in conformance with 15.5.3 to the Board of
Selectmen, the Building Inspector, and the general public by posting a notice in the Town
Hall. The annual permit limitation of residential developments, as provided in RSA
674:21, is to prevent a strain on municipal services and therefore, to provide for orderly
growth in Town. Permit limitations may be implemented as provided below:
15.7.1 Interim Permit Limitations: Once a Notice of Growth Impact is issued, then no residential
building permits shall be approved by the Building Inspector until after the hearing in
Section 15.8 is held and until after the Planning Board has set the number of permits
delineated in 15.8. The Planning Board has set the number of permits within 45 days of
the Notice of Growth Impact being issued.
15.8 PROCEDURES FOR PHASING AND PERMIT LIMITATIONS
Once a Notice of Growth Impact pursuant to 15.5.3 has been issued, then the following
procedures will be observed:
15.8.1 Planning Board Findings: The Planning Board will issue appropriate findings of fact to
accompany any Notice of Growth Impact issued pursuant to 15.5.3.
15.8.2 Public Hearing: Prior to invoking 15.6 Phasing or 15.7 Permit Limitations, the Planning
Board shall hold a public hearing with ten days’ notice to seek input from the general
public.
15.8.3 Determination of Action: After a public hearing in Section 15.8.2, the Planning Board shall
deliberate and decide whether (a) phasing should be invoked (b) permit limitations should
be imposed or (c) other appropriate action, and issue its decisions. Any decision will be
issued within 45 of the Notice of Growth Impact.
15.8.4 Permit Limitations: The following provisions shall apply:
a. The Planning Board as part of its decisions may specify what limitations are necessary
in the issuance of permits for residential units up until and during any corrective action
is taken by the Town and/or School District. In determining the number of permits to
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
156
be issued, the Planning Board shall consider the severity of the municipal service
burden, the amount of capacity remaining in the service, and the amount of time needed
to correct the service problem. After determining those facts, the Planning Board shall
set the number of dwelling unit permits that can reasonably be issued on an annual
basis.
b. After the public hearing, the Planning Board shall set the number of permits to be issued
for the one-year period following enactment of the limit or such other shorter period as
may be desirable. At the end of the year or such other shorter period, the Planning
Board shall hold a hearing to determine if the permit limitation should be removed or
altered. After making findings of fact, the Planning Board may (a) extend the permit
limitation, (b) alter the permit limitation, or (c) remove the permit limitation.
15.8.5 Phasing: The Planning Board as part of its decision may require phasing in accordance
with the provisions of Phasing 15.6.
15.8.6 Equitable Distribution: In order to insure equitable distribution of available permits, no
individual, partnership, corporation, or other entity or its related or affiliated entities or in
the case of individuals their relatives or persons associated in business may receive more
than 10 percent of the permits or permits for eight units, whichever is less, available during
the limitation period.
a. The Building Inspector shall consult with the Planning Board, and the Planning Board
shall devise an administrative procedure necessary to insure equitable distribution of
available dwelling unit permits under guidelines expressed above.
b. No application for a building permit will be accepted from any person who, in an
attempt to avoid the building permit limitations of this Ordinance, has failed to pay fair
consideration as defined by RSA 545:3 or any other person or entity who has the
purpose of evasion of the limitations of Section 15 of this Ordinance.
15.9 SEVERABILITY (Added 3/11)
Should any part of this ordinance be held invalid or unconstitutional by a court, such
holding shall not affect, impair or invalidate any other part of this ordinance, and, to such
end. All articles, sections and provisions of this ordinance are declared to be severable.
15.10 EFFECTIVE DATE (Added 3/11)
Adoption of this ordinance includes the repeal of all prior growth management ordinances
currently in effect. This ordinance becomes effective upon adoption and shall be reviewed
by the Planning Board annually, to determine if the ordinance shall be relaxed or ended.
15.11 SUNSET (Added 3/11)
This ordinance shall expire on March 31, 2014 unless amended to remain in effect beyond
that date.

to whether the building might be significant and preferably preserved within the
standards and specifications provided above. If no decision is made within five business
days, the application will be deemed to be approved and the permit may be issued.
b. Hold a meeting between the demolition review committee and the applicant (or
applicant's representative) to discuss alternatives to demolition if the committee
determines the building is significant and its loss potentially detrimental to the
community.

Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
165
other evidence to establish that the applicant either has or has not met all of the listed
conditions as stated below.

i. The variance will not be contrary to the public interest.
ii. The spirit of the ordinance is observed.
iii. Substantial justice is done.
iv. The values of surrounding properties are not diminished, and
v. Literal enforcement of the provisions of the ordinance would result in an
unnecessary hardship.
1. For purposes of this subparagraph, “unnecessary hardship” means that, owing
to special conditions of the property that distinguish it from other properties in
the area:
a. No fair and substantial relationship exists between the general public
purposes of the ordinance provision and the specific application of that
provision to the property; and
b. The proposed use is a reasonable one.
2. If the criteria in subparagraph 1. are not established, an unnecessary hardship
will be deemed to exist if, and only if, owing to special conditions of the
property that distinguish it from other properties in the area, the property cannot
be reasonably used in strict conformance with the ordinance, and a variance is
therefore necessary to enable a reasonable use of it.
3. The definition of “unnecessary hardship” set forth in this section shall apply
whether the provision of the ordinance from which a variance is sought is a
restriction on use, a dimensional or other limitation on a permitted use, or any
other requirement of the ordinance.
17.9 FINDINGS OF FACT
The Board of Adjustment shall present findings of fact for all its decisions and shall enter
such findings in its records.

17.8.3 shall be deemed conditions upon such special exception or variance.
17.11 DURATION OF APPROVAL (ADDED 3/15).
All variances and special exceptions granted by the Board of Adjustment shall be valid
for a period of two (2) years after the date of the decision of the Board of Adjustment;
provided, however, that once substantial compliance with said decision has occurred or
substantial completion of the improvements allowed by said decision has occurred, the
rights of the owner or his successor in interest shall vest and no subsequent changes in
subdivision regulations or zoning ordinances shall operate to affect such decision. In the
event that at the expiration of such two-year period substantial compliance with said
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
166
decision or substantial completion of the improvements allowed by said decision has not
been undertaken, said decision shall be null and void.

commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage,
regardless of actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include
any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe

Development Permit. Applications for the Permit shall include the following: general
information, site plan, surveyor's certification, building plans, certified flood proofing
methods for non-residential structures, etc. Applications for the Permit can be obtained
from the Town office. A fee of $10.00 shall be charged for each permit, payable to the
Building Inspector.
18.3 DESIGN CRITERIA
The Building Inspector shall review all building permit applications for new construction
or substantial improvements to determine whether proposed building sites will be
reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is in a special flood hazard area,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall:
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
170
a. Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or
lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads,
including the effects of buoyancy;
b. Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage;
c. Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
d. Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning
equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent
water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of
flooding.
18.4 SEWER DESIGN
Where new and replacement water sewer systems (including on-site systems) are proposed
in a special flood hazard area, the applicant shall provide the Building Inspector with
assurance that new and replacement sanitary sewage systems will be designed to minimize
or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems
into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems will be located to avoid impairment
to them or contamination from them during periods of flooding.
18.5 RECORD OF CONSTRUCTION
The Building Inspector shall maintain for public inspection, and furnish upon request, any
certification of floodproofing and the as-built elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of
the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures, and
include whether or not such structures contain a basement. If the structure has been
floodproofed, the as-built elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the structure
was floodproofed. This information must be furnished by the applicant.
18.6 STATE AND FEDERAL PERMITS
The Building Inspector shall review proposed developments to assure that all necessary
permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is
required by Federal or State law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. 1334. It shall be the responsibility of the
applicant to certify these assurances to the Building Inspector.
18.7 WATERCOURSES
18.7.1 In riverine situations, prior to the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the applicant for
such authorization shall notify the Wetlands Bureau of the New Hampshire Environmental
Services Department and submit copies of such notification to the Building Inspector.
Further, the applicant shall be required to submit copies of said notification to those
adjacent communities as determined by the Building Inspector.
18.7.2 Within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse, the applicant shall submit to the
Building Inspector, certification provided by a registered professional engineer assuring
that the flood carrying capacity of the watercourse has been maintained.
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
171
18.7.3 The Building Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway data
available from Federal, State, or other sources as criteria for requiring that all development
located in Zone A meet the following floodway requirement:
"No encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other
development are allowed within the floodway that would result in any increase in flood
levels within the community during the base flood discharge."
18.7.4 Along watercourses that have not had a Regulatory Floodway designated, no new
construction, substantial improvements or other development (including fill) shall be
permitted within Zone AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect
of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one
foot at any point within the community.
18.8 DISTRICT BOUNDARIES AND DESIGN
18.8.1 In special flood hazard areas, the Building Inspector shall determine the base flood
elevations. The Building Inspector may require a registered New Hampshire surveyor to
delineate the base flood zone, certified in writing. Flood elevations shall be determined in
the following order of precedence according to the data available:
a. In Zone AE, refer to the base flood elevation provided in the community's Flood
Insurance Study and accompanying FIRM;
b. In Zone A, the Building Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base
flood elevation data available from Federal, State, development proposals submitted to
the community (example: subdivisions, site approvals, etc.) or other source.
c. In Zone A where the base flood elevation is not available, the base flood elevation shall
be at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade.
18.8.2 The Building Inspector's base flood elevation determination will be used as criteria for
requiring in Zones AE and A that:
a. All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures have the
lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation;
b. That all new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level; or
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities shall:
i. Be flood proofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight
with the walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
ii. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrodynamic and hydrostatic
loads and the effects of buoyancy; and
iii. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for
meeting the provisions of this section.
c. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within special flood
hazard areas shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of
the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation, and be securely
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
172
anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may
include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This
requirement is in addition to applicable State and local anchoring requirements for
resisting wind forces;
d. For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the
lowest floor that are subject to flooding are permitted providing the enclosed areas meet
the following requirements:
i. The enclosed area is unfinished or flood resistant, usable solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, or storage;
ii. The area is not a basement;
iii. The area shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria: a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The
bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be
equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they permit
the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters.
e. All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A and AE shall either:
i. Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;
ii. Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or
iii. Meet all standards of Section 18.2 and the elevation and anchoring requirements for
“manufactured homes” in paragraph (c) of Section 18.8.2.
18.9 VARIANCES AND APPEALS
a. Any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building Inspector made
under this Ordinance may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment as set forth
in NHRSA §676:5.
b. If the applicant, upon appeal, requests a variance as authorized by NHRSA §674:33, I
(b), the applicant shall have the burden of showing in addition to the usual variance
standards under state law:
i. That the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, or extraordinary public expense;
ii. That if the proposed variance is for activity within a designated regulatory
floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result;
and
iii. That the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford
relief.
c. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall notify the applicant in writing that: (1) the
issuance of a variance to construct below the base flood level will result in increased
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
173
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance
coverage, and (2) such construction shall below the base flood level increases risks to
life and property. Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance
actions.
d. The Town of Stratham shall (1) maintain a record of all variance actions, including
their justification for their issuance, and (2) report such variances issued in its annual
or biennial report submitted to FEMA’s Federal Insurance Administrator.

services.
m. Limit the duration of the approval of a collocation application or modification
application.
19.5 SITING STANDARDS--NEW TOWERS OR SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATIONS
19.5.1 General: All new towers and substantial modifications shall comply with all applicable
ordinances and regulations, shall require a conditional use permit from the Stratham
Planning Board, and shall also require Site Plan Approval from the Stratham Planning
Board.
a. Principal or Accessory Use: Antennas and towers may be considered either
principal or accessory uses. A different existing use or an existing structure on the
same lot shall not preclude the installation of an antenna or tower on such lot. For
purposes of determining whether the installation of a tower complies with district
development regulations, including but not limited to setback requirements, lotcoverage
requirements, and other such requirements, the dimensions of the entire
lot shall control, even though the towers may be located on leased parcels within
such lots. Towers that are constructed, and antennas that are installed, in accordance
with the provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed to constitute the expansion
of a nonconforming use or structure, and;
Town of Stratham Zoning Ordinance Amended March 2019
178
b. In all applications for construction of a new tower or substantial modification of an
existing tower, the applicant must prove by substantial evidence, including but not
limited to a town-wide site evaluation plan for coverage that details possible
antennae or co-location options which contemplate a 5-year development horizon,
that a bona fide need exists for the tower or substantial modification and that no
reasonable combination of locations, techniques, or technologies will satisfy the
need, and;
c. Prior to the issuance of a permit for a new tower, the applicant shall demonstrate
commitment to joint use as follows:
1. The applicant requesting the permit shall submit evidence to the Town of
Stratham demonstrating to the Planning Board that a genuine effort has been
made to solicit additional users for the proposed new tower. Evidence of this
shall include, at a minimum, copies of notices sent by registered mail, return
receipt requested, to all other providers of cellular and wireless
communications services within Rockingham County and adjacent counties,
advising of the intent to construct a new tower, identifying the location,
inviting the joint use and sharing of costs, and requesting a written response
within fifteen business days.
2. The applicant shall sign an instrument, maintained by the Town of Stratham,
agreeing to encourage and promote the joint use of telecommunications towers
within the Town and, to that extent, committing that there shall be no
unreasonable act or omission that would have the effect of excluding,
obstructing or delaying joint use of any tower where fair and just market
reasonable compensation is offered for such use; and
d. The owner of a telecommunication facility shall establish a performance bond, or
provide the Town of Stratham with an irrevocable letter of credit in the same amount,
ensuring adequate funds to return the site to pre-telecommunication facility
condition. In the event of a transfer of ownership, the seller shall be responsible for
notifying the buyer of this requirement and for notifying the Town of the transfer.

19.7 CONSTRUCTION PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS
19.7.1 Aesthetics, Noise, and Lighting: The guidelines in this subsection shall govern the
location of all new towers, substantial modifications to existing towers, or alternative tower
structures. However, the Planning Board may waive these requirements in accordance
with Section 19.8: Waivers. Any new or substantially modified tower shall comply
with the Stratham Noise Regulations.
a. Towers shall either maintain a galvanized steel finisher, subject to any applicable
standards of the FAA, or be painted a neutral color, so as to reduce visual
obtrusiveness;
b. At a tower site, the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent
possible, use materials, colors, textures, screening, and landscaping that will blend
the tower facilities with the natural setting and built environment. These buildings
and facilities shall also be subject to all other Site Plan Review Regulation
requirements;
c. Towers shall not be artificially lighted, unless required by the FAA or other applicable
authority. If lighting is required, the governing authority may review the available
lighting alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to
the surrounding views;
d. Towers shall not contain any permanent or temporary signs, writing, symbols, or any
graphic representation of any kind.
19.7.2 Federal Requirements: All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations
of the FAA, FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to
regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then the
owners of the towers and antennas governed by this ordinance shall bring such towers
and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six (6)
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent
compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring
towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower, as abandoned, at the owner’s expense
through the execution of the posted security.
All support structures, including but not limited to generators, fuel storage facilities, etc.,
shall comply with the setbacks of the underlying zoning district as applicable at the time
of application as well as with the Town Building Ordinance (See Also 19.7.3 below).
19.7.3 Building Codes-Safety Standards: To ensure the structural integrity of towers and
antennas, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with
standards contained in applicable local building codes and the applicable standards for
towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from
time to time. If, upon inspection, the Town concludes that a tower fails to comply
with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then upon
notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring
such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower
into compliance within 30 days, such action shall constitute an abandonment and
grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna, as abandoned, at the owner’s expense
through execution of the posted security.

for a minor subdivision as set forth in Section 2.4 of these regulations shall not be
required to submit under this section. (Rev. 3/06)
2.2.1 Purposes of the Consultation:
The purpose of the consultation is to familiarize the Planning Board with the basic
concept of the proposed subdivision. The consultation is further designed to acquaint the
potential applicant with the formal application process and particular information that the
Board may request, to suggest methods for resolving possible problems in the
13
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
development, design and layout, and to make the potential applicant aware of the
recommendations in the Master Plan (if applicable) to the property in question.
2.2.2 Documents:
In order to facilitate discussion, the potential applicant is requested to prepare a base map
of the property to be subdivided. It should be drawn to scale, and may be drawn in
pencil. The proposed subdivision should be drawn on the base map. Dimensions may be
approximate. The data may be tentative, but all information shall be sufficiently clear to
illustrate all conditions and the proposed subdivision and/or development of the property.

future reference purposes.
Neither the applicant nor the Planning Board shall be bound by the discussions.
However, the Planning Board shall be entitled to make recommendations with respect to
the material presented to assist the applicant in preparing a formal application that will
meet the development standards of the Town as expressed in these Regulations and in
other ordinances and/or regulations. The Planning Board shall enter into the minutes and

2.3 FORMAL APPLICATION REVIEW PROCESS:
Whether or not a Preliminary Consultation has been conducted, an applicant shall prepare
and submit an application for subdivision approval in accordance with and to the
standards set forth in these Regulations. This formal review process is designed to afford
14

a. Within the appropriate time frames as established by NH RSA 676:4, the Board shall
approve, conditionally approve, disapprove without Prejudice or disapprove the
application. The reasons for disapproval of a plan shall be stated in the record of the
Board. Approval of a plan shall be endorsed on the plan by the Chairman or Vice
Chair of the Board. The time to act may be extended in accordance with NH RSA
676:4-f.
i. Conditional Approval: All conditional approvals are valid for a period of not
more than 120 days, unless the Planning Board, at their discretion, chooses to
extend the number of days required to meet precedent conditions. All precedent
conditions of approval must be met within this 120-day period (or time period
established by the Planning Board at time of conditional approval) or the approval
shall be considered null and void. In cases where extenuating circumstances
prevent the meeting of precedent conditions within 120 days, the applicant may
request an extension, to be filed (in writing and with justification) with the Board
no later than 14 days prior to the expiration date of the conditions. The Planning
Board shall then vote on whether or not to grant such extensions.
ii. Approval with Conditions: The Planning Board may attach reasonable conditions
to an approval in order to ensure that the public interest is upheld. Such
conditions may include, but are not limited to the following:

4. Any other conditions that the Planning Board finds necessary to secure the
public interest.
iii. Disapproval without Prejudice: If the Planning Board finds that certain
administrative/procedural requirements have not been met, but could be met with
additional time, the Planning Board may disapprove the application without
prejudice. If such a finding is made, the Planning Board shall advise the applicant
in writing what is necessary to correct the administrative/ procedural defect.
iv. Disapproval: If the Planning Board finds that the application does not meet the
standards of these Regulations, fails to comply with other local or State laws, or
19
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
will have an adverse impact on surrounding areas or the community, the Board
may disapprove the application. In the event of disapproval, the grounds for
disapproval shall be specified in the records of the Board and communicated to
the applicant in writing.
b. Vesting: Approved subdivisions shall be protected from future changes in regulations
and ordinances in accordance with NH RSA 674:39 as summarized by the following:
i. Every subdivision approved by the Planning Board shall be exempt from all
subsequent changes in Subdivision Regulations and Zoning Ordinances adopted
by the Town of Stratham, except those regulations and ordinances which
expressly protect public health standards, such as water quality and sewage
treatment requirements, for a period of 4 years after the date of certification of the
subdivision by the Planning Board; provided, however, once substantial
completion of the improvements as shown on the plans have occurred in
compliance with the approved plans, or the terms of said approval or unless
otherwise stipulated by the Planning Board, the rights of the owner or the owner's
successor in interest shall vest and no subsequent changes in Subdivision
Regulations or Zoning Ordinances shall operate to affect such improvements; and
further provided that:
1. Active and substantial development or building has begun on the site by the
owner or the owner's successor in interest in accordance with the approved
plans within 12 months after the date of approval (certification by the
Planning Board), or in accordance with the terms of the approval, and, if a
bond or other security to cover the costs of roads, drains, or sewers is required
in connection with such approval, such bond or other security is posted with
the Town, at the time of commencement of such development;
2. The development remains in full compliance with the public health
regulations and ordinances of the Town of Stratham; and
3. At the time of approval (certification of the plans by the Planning Board), the
subdivision conforms to the Subdivision Regulations, and Zoning Ordinances
then in effect at the time of such approval.
ii. For purposes of these regulations, "active & substantial development" shall be
defined as:
1. Construction of and/or installation of basic infrastructure to support the
development (including all of the following: at least 1 building foundation
wall/footing, roadways, access ways, etc. to a minimum of gravel base; and
utilities placed in underground conduit ready for connection to proposed
buildings/structures) in accordance with the approved plans; and

Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
4. Items i, ii, and iii shall be reviewed and approved by the Town’s Road Agent,
Building Inspector or their designated agents.
Movement of earth, excavation, or logging of a site without completion of items i,
ii, iii, & iv, above, shall not be considered "active and substantial development."
Plans approved in phases shall be subject to this definition for the phase currently
being developed.
2.3.9 Phasing:
To insure that the rate of growth of the Town does not unreasonably interfere with the
Town's capacity for planned, orderly, and sensible expansion of its services to
accommodate such growth, the Planning Board at its sole discretion may require phasing
of development projects, as provided in RSA 674:21.
a. For any development project (single family, multi-family, cluster, or mixed) or more
than eight family dwelling units, the Planning Board may require phasing for a period
of up to five years. For a project larger than 50 units, the Planning Board is entitled
to negotiate a longer period of phasing time, based on the size of the project and the
potential impact on the Town and Town services.
b. In order to insure equitable phasing, no developer shall circumvent the purposes of
phasing by dividing a parcel of land into separate subdivision or separate forms or
names of ownership.
c. The phasing process will be at the subdivision or beginning part of the construction
process. Once a phasing plan is approved by the Planning Board with dates of
allowed construction in each phase, the approved plan displaying the phasing plan
shall be signed by the Planning Board Chairman and filed with the Rockingham
County Registry of Deeds. See Addendum B.
2.4 MINOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL:
Proposals involving minor subdivisions which create not more than three lots for building
development purposes and which do not require the installation of any new public streets
or proposals which do not involve the creation of lots for building development purposes
may be submitted, reviewed and approved at one or more Board meetings subject to the
following conditions.
2.4.1 Submission and Notice:
An application for minor subdivision approval shall be submitted in the same manner as

SECTION IV: APPLICATION PROCEDURES & REQUIREMENTS:
4.1 OVERVIEW:
An applicant shall use the following general principles and design and construction
standards when designing and laying out a subdivision development within the Town of
Stratham. These principles and requirements shall be construed as the minimum
requirements. The Planning Board may require higher standards in individual cases or

An applicant shall observe the following general principles of land subdivision and
development:
4.2.1 Conformity to Master Plan and Official Map:
The subdivision plan shall be in harmony and consistent with the Master Plan and/or
Official Map of the Town.
4.2.2 Character of Land:
All land to be subdivided shall be, in the judgment of the Board, of such a character that
it can be used for building purposes without danger to public health, safety, or the
environment. Land subject to periodic flooding, poor drainage or other hazardous
conditions, shall not ordinarily be subdivided. Land with inadequate capacity for sanitary
sewage disposal shall not be subdivided unless connected to an approved public sewerage
disposal system.

If the owner places restrictions on any land in the subdivision and/or development greater
than those required by these Regulations or the Zoning Ordinance, such restrictions or
reference thereto may be required to be indicated on the subdivision plat, or the Planning
Board may require that restrictive covenants be recorded with the Registry of Deeds in
form approved by the Town Attorney.
28
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
4.3 SOILS-BASED LOT SIZE DETERMINATION:
The lot sizes for subdivisions in the Town of Stratham shall be based on the following
specified criteria:
4.3.1 Minimum Lot Sizes:
In the absence of municipal water or sewerage facilities, minimum lot sizes within all
subdivisions shall, in addition to meeting the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance for
the district wherein the subdivision is proposed, also meet the lot size requirements
specified in Section 4.3.4, "Table of Minimum Lot Size by Soil Classification." This
requirement is subject to the following qualifications:
a. Where more than one soil type is found on a lot, a soil carrying capacity of those soils
occurring on the lot shall be used to determine the minimum lot size. (Rev. 8/99)
b. Wetlands may be used as part of the computed lot size according to the following:
i. Areas designated as poorly drained soils (type B hydric) may be utilized to fulfill
the Town's minimum lot size requirement provided that a contiguous non-wetland
area of at least 30,000 square feet is provided for each building lot. This
contiguous non-wetland area must be sufficient in size and configuration to
adequately accommodate all housing and required utilities such as sewage
disposal, water supply, and all applicable setbacks. (Rev. 11/93)
ii. Areas designated as very poorly drained, fresh or saltwater marsh or alluvial soils
may not be utilized to fulfill the minimum lot size.
iii. No septic system, leach field or other waste disposal facility shall be installed
within fifty (50) feet of the edge of any poorly drained soil (type B hydric) or
within seventy-five (75) feet of the edge of any very poorly drained soil (type A
hydric) or open water. (Rev. 11/93)
iv. There shall be no filling of wetlands for the purpose of providing the minimum
distance between the wetlands and sewage disposal systems. (Rev. 7/89)
c. Minimum lot sizes for residential developments with greater than four (4) bedrooms
per unit and for commercial and industrial developments shall be determined as
follows: (Rev. 8/91)
i. For multi-family residential use, the minimum lot size shall be proportionately
smaller than the lot size indicated in the Table of Section 4.3.4 as determined by
the following formulas:
1. Number of 1 and/or 2 bedroom units = Area of each soil type on the lot
divided by (lot size from the Table in Section 4.3.4, 1A/B x .65).
2. Number of 3 bedroom units = Area of each soil type on the lot divided by (lot
size from the Table in Section 4.3.4, 1A/B x .85).
ii. For duplex use, where the total number of bedrooms in the building exceeds 4, the
lot size shall be increased by 50% of the minimum lot size as determined by the
Table in Section 4.3.4. (Rev. 1/01)
29
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
iii. For commercial and industrial uses with residential-type waste, the lot sizes will
be determined by the formula:
Q (gpd)
Lot Size = X Lot Size from the Table in
200 gpd (sq. ft.) Section 4.3.4,1A/B.
Where: Q = gallons of wastewater to be discharged per day. The amount of flow
will be determined by use of Env-Ws 1008.02 Average Daily Flow Volume.
iv. Final site plan approval for commercial/industrial developments which generate
wastes of such nature and character as to require state or federal permits for
pre-treatment and discharge or sub-surface disposal shall not be granted until all
such permits are secured provided, however that conditional approval may be
granted per RSA 676:4, I (i). The conditions upon which such permits are issued
shall comply with state and local regulations and be made part of the record
before the Planning Board.
4.3.2 Determination of Soil Type:
a. Tests for determining soils information for use in this Section shall be performed by a
qualified soil scientist using on-site inspections. A report and plan shall be prepared
by the qualified soil scientist and filed with the Planning Board.
b. Soil data using the standards of “High Intensity Soil Maps of New Hampshire” shall
be provided as part of the subdivision plan at the scale and dimensions required. Any
cover letters or explanatory data provided by the qualified soil scientist shall also be
submitted.
c. Such tests shall be performed with the advice and under the direction of the Planning
Board or its designated agent.
d. All costs of performing such investigations shall be borne by the subdivider.
4.3.3 Relationship Between State and Local Regulations:
Where both State and local regulations are applicable, the more stringent regulation shall
apply. If the State regulation addresses an issue not included in the local regulation or if
the local regulation addresses an issue not included in the State regulation, that regulation
shall automatically apply.
4.3.4 Conservation Land Exception:
Any portion of a lot or other land which was protected by a recorded conservation
easement and where the easement provided for a restriction of the development rights of
the property or shown as intended for protection or dedication on any plan conditionally
approved and not revoked by the Planning Board at the time of application, shall not be
included in the calculation of minimum lot size or in the calculation of any Yield Plan as
defined under Section 4.6.4 (OPEN SPACE CLUSTER SUBDIVISION). (Added

Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
4.4 DESIGN STANDARDS:
The following design standards shall be observed in the layout of a subdivision and/or
development of a site: Exception; (See Section 3.8 and Section 3.9 of the Zoning
Regulations)
4.4.1 Lot Configuration: (Amended 06/06)
a. Purposes and Intent: The intent of these regulations is to enhance and insure
consistency with the Stratham Zoning Ordinance and the following purposes: (Added
06/06)
i. To promote lots which are shaped in a manner that promotes clarity of ownership,
access across fee-title land rather than easement interests, which may promote
property disputes, and to promote the convenient and harmonious development of
the land.
ii. To prevent odd shaped lots that cannot reasonably be interpreted to be an orderly
layout of the land and insure that proper description of ownership or ease of
identification will carry forward in time.
iii. Lots within a cluster subdivision are not subject to these requirements.
b. Design Standards: The following criteria should be considered as design standards. It
is recognized that not all of these standards may be achievable in every case; for this
reason, each application should be carefully considered, and waivers may be granted
where appropriate. (Added 06/06)
i. Land shall be subdivided and improved in reasonable conformity to existing
topography in order to minimize grading, cutting and filling, and in order to retain
the natural contours, limit storm water run-off, and conserve the natural cover and
soil. After a preliminary layout has been submitted to the Board, no topsoil, tree,
sand or gravel shall be removed from the subdivision for any other purpose than
to meet construction needs for that particular subdivision or to meet any
requirements or these regulations.
ii. Existing features, which would add value to the subdivision, such as trees,
watercourses, falls, brooks, historic spots, view sheds, stonewalls and similar
irreplaceable assets, are encouraged to be preserved in the subdivision to the
greatest extent possible.
iii. The lot size, width, depth, shape, and orientation and the minimum building
setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and the type
of development and use contemplated. Lots shall provide satisfactory sites for
buildings and be properly related to topography. Lots shall not contain irregular
shapes or elongations solely to provide necessary square footage.
iv. No portion of a lot created under these regulations shall be less than 50’ in width.
v. The minimum building envelope area shall contain sufficient space for natural
expansion residential uses commonly associated with single-family structures.
Building setbacks shall not be included within the building envelope.
35
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
vi. Building envelopes shall be selected so as not to intrude on the tops of visible
ridgelines.
vii. Building envelopes shall be located to minimize the visual impact of the
development unless such placement is part of an integrated plan to protect view
sheds or minimize the visual intrusion of the improved portion of the subdivision.
viii. Building envelopes shall not include wetlands or 100-year floodplains.
4.4.2 Pork Chop Lot Subdivision:
Optimal Pork Chop Subdivisions in the Residential/Agricultural District: (Added 8/99)
(Rev. 6/00)
At its option, the Planning Board may permit residential subdivisions for single-family
homes only, of one lot divided into two lots, provided that the following is found to exist:
a. One of the lots, which would result from the proposed subdivision, must have 200
feet of frontage upon, and access to, an approved road. The second lot must have
frontage of 50 feet upon, and access to, an approved road. The approved road may be
public or private. Total frontage of the original lot must be less than that required
under current zoning to create two conventional lots.
b. The lot to be divided currently has a house located on it.
c. Both lots must conform to the density, soil type, setbacks, and other appropriate
subdivision or zoning regulations pertaining to this district, except with regard to
frontage and access to an approved road, for the newly created lot.
d. The pork chop or back lot must have square footage 50% greater than the square
footage that would regularly be required by current soil-type density regulations.
e. The pork chop lot must be 200 feet wide at a line touching the front of the principal
residence, and parallel to a line connecting the intersection of the side lot lines with
the street line.
f. At its option, the Planning Board is empowered to require the dedication to the Town,
of a sixty (60) foot strip of land passing from the approved road to the rear of the
property in question, to ensure future access to back lands alongside or to the rear of
any subdivision proposed under this pork chop regulation. (Rev. 8/99)
This type of subdivision will be granted on a one time only basis and said restriction shall
be provided as a covenant to the deed. All newly created lots within a pork chop lot
subdivision shall not be created as part of a new, multi-lot subdivision proposal.
4.4.3 Streets:
a. Platting of Streets: Insofar as the Master Plan or Official Map does not indicate the
size, location, direction and extent of a street, and subject to the regulations
hereinafter specified regarding definite minimum widths, the arrangements of streets
in a subdivision shall provide for the continuation of the principal street existing in
the adjoining subdivisions, or of their proper projection when adjoining property is
not subdivided, and shall be of a width at least as great as that of such existing streets
but no less than a sixty (60) foot right-of-way. Where, in the opinion of the Board,
36
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
physical conditions make such continuance or conformity impractical, the Board may
permit dead-end streets as described below.
i. Dead-end Streets: Unless restricted by physical conditions, all turnarounds for
dead-end streets shall contain a minimum of two (2) legal-sized lots. See
Addendum A (Figures *) for designs.
ii. Maximum Length: The maximum length of road shall be one thousand (1,000)
feet in total.
c. Street Rights-of-Way: The minimum right-of-way for streets shall be as shown on
the street right-of-way cross sections per Addendum A.
d. Access: There shall be no reserve strips controlling access to streets, except where
the control of such strips is definitely placed with the Town under conditions
approved by the Board. The subdividing of the land shall be such as to provide each
lot, by means of either public street, with satisfactory access to an existing public
street or highway.
e. Street Intersection Angles: A street should intersect at a ninety-degree angle.
k. Street Name Signs: At all intersections street signs shall be provided and installed by
the developer in conformity with the specifications of the Town. (Rev. 11/93)
Until such time as each street is accepted by the Town as a public way, the signposts
at the intersections of such street with any other street shall have affixed thereto a
sign designating such street as a private way.
l. Street Names: Street names of all proposed streets shall be subject to approval by the
Board of Selectmen. No proposed street name shall duplicate the names of existing
streets irrespective of the use of the suffix "street", "avenue", "boulevard", "drive", or
"court". The continuation of an existing street shall have the same name. (Rev. 8/99)
m. Street Numbers: Street numbers shall be obtained from the Assessing Department.
Such assigned numbers must be posted on the lot and visible from the road prior to
issuance of building permit.
o. Grass Strips: All areas between the exterior street lines which are not occupied by
approved sidewalks shall be rolled, loamed and seeded in accordance with the
specifications of the Town. (Rev. 11/93)
4.4.4 Curbing:
The Planning Board, in its discretion, may require the installation of granite (either
vertical or sloped) on streets in order to channel surface water, to control vehicular traffic,
to separate vehicular from pedestrian areas and/or to enhance the quality of the
subdivision. Curbing shall meet standards set forth by NHDOT. (Rev. 8/99)
4.4.5 Sidewalks:
The applicant may be required by the Planning Board to install concrete sidewalk of a
minimum of six (6) feet in width along proposed roads.
37
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
4.4.6 Driveways Standards: (Rev. 06/06) See Addendum A, Driveway Detail
a. Related Improvements
i. The Board may, at the recommendation of Public Works, require improvement of
existing access/egress point(s) in order to provide safe traffic flow onto abutting
streets, should increased traffic be generated by the proposed development
ii. Off-site improvements may be required, such as but not limited to, increasing
pavement width or adding deceleration lanes, curbing and signaling devices, in
order to mitigate hazardous impacts that are generated by the particular needs and
impacts of the site.
iii Driveways shall be located in such a manner as to promote all season safe access
and to prevent unreasonable negative impacts to the owners or occupants of
neighboring parcels.
iv. All driveways shall be constructed to prevent all drainage from entering onto the
traveled way.
v. All driveways shall provide adequate drainage in the Town right-of-way and from
the property itself. It shall be the responsibility of the landowner to correct
deficiencies and maintain the driveway and drainage facilities.
b. Private Driveways and Access - Private driveways and access serving any part of a
development shall remain in private ownership and the developer shall provide legal
instruments to insure their continued maintenance and ownership. All private
accesses shall comply with these and other town regulations relating to construction
and maintenance.
c. Access to State Highways - Driveways and access onto State highways shall be
designed in accordance with the NH Department of Transportation's Rules as
amended, and receive approval there under prior to final town approval of the
subdivision plan.
d. Driveways and Access Points: The Board, or its designee, shall approve the final
design and installation for a proposed access/egress point onto any town road or way
within any new development. Said point shall provide for adequate sight distances,
grades, widths and curb.
4.4.7 Community Water Service/Hydrants: (Rev. 11/93)
a. Newly proposed community water systems, as defined by RSA 485:1, shall be
designed by professional engineer licensed in New Hampshire. Site selection of
community wells shall conform to the applicable New Hampshire Code of
Administrative rules entitled, "Site Selection of Wells for Community Water
Systems.” Each system shall be designed to handle the expected flows for present
and future development within the subdivision. The number and location of all fire
hydrants associated with fire ponds shall be determined by the Fire Department.
Newly proposed major groundwater users (defined by the State as public water
systems using 20,000 gallons per day or more) shall submit a detailed water supply
study as part of their application. Said study shall, at a minimum, address the
38
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
requirements outlined in the above referenced administrative rules for siting
community water systems. Said study shall be prepared by a professional engineer,
hydrologist, hydrogeologist, or other groundwater professional.
Newly proposed major groundwater users which plan on utilizing a Stratham aquifer
(see boundaries of the Town's Aquifer Protection District) as a supply source shall
address the following additional items as part of their detailed water supply study:
i. The water system's overall impact on the aquifer's production capability in respect
to other potential users of the aquifer as a public water supply;
ii. The potential for de-watering adjacent wetlands;
iii. Potential effects on the surrounding water table;
iv. Potential changes to the base flows of adjacent watercourses; and,
v. Potential effects on wells located on abutting properties
b. Hydrants
i. In the interest of public safety, all new subdivisions that will contain five (5) or more

a. Threshold Bonus: To be considered by the Planning Board for a Conditional Use
Permit the proposed Open Space Cluster plan shall provide that a minimum of 35% of
the total parcel be established as open space and protected as such in perpetuity.
The required open space may be used, with conditions as may be required by the
Planning Board, for the protection of forest or other natural or environmental areas
and as set forth in Section 4.6.6.
53
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
If the land proposed for protection is found to be significant to the protection of the
natural environment or that allowing the placement of any improvements would
adversely affect or destroy wildlife corridors, natural dense forested stands or active
farm lands, the board may restrict such uses from locating within the protected open
space areas.
The purposes for which open space areas are proposed shall be fully documented by
the applicant.
For such consideration the development shall be awarded a density bonus of 1 unit as
set forth Ordinances.
b. Frontage Lots: A density bonus of up to 2 (two) lots may be awarded for the
preservation of each potential frontage lot as open space. In granting the bonus the
board may consider the following:
i. The ability to provide a visual buffer to the development area,
ii. The protection of natural viewscapes,
iii. The historical or environmental value of the provided lots,
iv. Active usage for agricultural purposes and/or the protection of historical farming
activities.
v. Be a buildable lot with the required legal frontage on a roadway existing at the
time of application.
vi. The lot be preserved in a natural condition.
c. Recreation & Public Access Bonus: For the development of new recreational
facilities such as parks, playgrounds, trails and/or community centers, the board may
grant an additional density bonus of up to 5%. If the improvements are made
available to the general public, this bonus may be increased to a maximum of 10%.
In granting the bonus the board may consider the following:
i. Self-directed trails and facilities, green-space parks and family picnic areas,
ii. Open fields prepared for the use of active sports and group activities,
iii. Constructed play grounds and play areas,
iv. Community center or meeting facilities.
The nature of public access required to trigger the additional bonus is pedestrian
traffic. The instrument granting access, acceptable to the Planning Board, may
reasonably restrict the use of motorized vehicles.
d. Unique Land and Environmental Features and/or Facilities: Where the development
is able to protect unique characteristics or for the development of innovative sewage
treatment or stormwater facilities, the Planning Board may grant an additional density
bonus of up to 30%. In granting the bonus the board may consider the following:
54
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
i. View sheds: which are lands or corridors of land that contribute to the visual
landscape of the town, including items such as, but not limited to, open fields,
stonewalls, hills, mature stands of trees, visible water bodies and their natural
buffers.
ii. Historically Significant Buildings and Landscapes: identified as such in the
Master Plan, that includes buildings and associated uses that are maintained and
visually separated from the developed portion of the cluster development.
Structures or landscapes not identified as such through the Master Plan may be
determined by sufficient evidence presented to the Planning Board during review
of the cluster development. Such evidence may include Heritage Commission
comment, listing or eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic
Landmarks, or other qualified statements of historic value.
iii. Valuable Wildlife and Environmental Areas: that are otherwise buildable land,
proven as such through an environmental resource inventory by a qualified
wildlife biologist specializing in either flora or fauna. Reports by a wetlands or
soil scientist shall not satisfy this criteria.
iv. Linking Open Space Parcels or Trail Corridors: through the site with existing
trails or open space networks. The beginning of such a network or trail way may
be considered as linking where reasonable opportunity is present for establishing
through corridors into neighboring parcels and provided that Conservation
Commission comment is in favor of this location.
v. Innovative Stormwater and Wastewater Treatment Facilities: which provide for
the reintegration of stormwater into the groundwater system or provide for the
innovative treatment of wastewater within the development or through the sharing
of an innovative treatment system with other nearby developments through the
development of a community wastewater treatment system as may be approved
by the NH Department of Environmental Services.
vi. Agricultural Lands and Use Bonus: Where the development protects
agriculturally valuable lands and provides permission for their use as such in
perpetuity, the development may be awarded a density bonus. The Planning
Board shall, on a case-by-case basis, determine the bonus percentage by
considering the size of the project and the number of acres of farmland preserved.
The open space portion preserved for agricultural use must be land that has been
historically farmed, or contain good soils for farming and must be reasonably
accessible to receive a bonus. A minimum of three and one-half (3.5) contiguous
acres must be available for agricultural uses in order to receive any bonus under
this section. The instrument granting use, acceptable to the Planning Board, may
reasonably restrict the type or intensity of farming to occur to prevent nuisances.
This provision only requires that permission is reasonably available, the fact that
agricultural uses are not pursued at any particular time does not affect the validity
of the bonus.
vii. Additional Open Space: Increase the amount of protected open space to a
minimum of 50%.
55
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
e. Innovative layout and design of the project to encourage a village or community type
environment with such amenities as village greens and parks, community view sheds
and/or integration into existing protected farm activities or existing recreational
opportunities, the Stratham Planning Board may award the development additional
density bonus of up to 15% based on the following standards:
i. The location and integration of the development into an existing active farm or
recreational activity, where the residents are able to participate in the recreational
activity or where a majority of the units abut the active farm lands.
ii. The development of a central village green with single-loaded streets and service
ways which allow units to front on village greens, park areas or view sheds.
iii. Layout of the development where all units may enjoy direct community access to
view sheds or parklands.
Innovative layout, which provides for the integration of the development into the
natural features and forested areas of the parcel, which would provide for the
protection and enjoyment of the natural environment yet provide for pedestrian travel
within the site. Or for the development of terminal vistas which will maximize the
visual impact of any protected areas so that residents and visitors will correctly
perceive the conservation emphasis of the development.
4.6.6 Open Space Criteria:
Useable Open Space shall be reasonably available for recreational use by the residents of
the subdivision. General public use may be considered but shall not be required. The
usability criteria are necessitated by the subdivision. Where land is to be developed in a

land, adequate recreational space is a necessity. These criteria are intended to provide
that those moving into the subdivision will have an adequate recreational area.
a. A minimum of 25% of the total required open space land must be useable uplands
and reasonably available for recreational purposes, provided however, that no more
than 50% shall be utilized for such purpose in order to preserve a reasonable

used parcels, the Planning Board shall require mitigative measures to lessen any
projected negative effects. Such measures may include sufficiently opaque visual
buffers, placement within the interior of the development, and limitations on night
lighting and use.
56
Stratham Subdivision Regulations May 2019
iii. Recreational facilities shall be constructed by the developer or financial provision

SECTION I: GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1 AUTHORITY:
These Regulations are enacted in accordance with the authority conferred in RSA

1.2 PURPOSES:
The purposes of these Regulations are to:

of: (1) inadequate drainage or conditions conducive to flooding of the property or that
of another; (2) inadequate protection for the quality of groundwater; (3) undesirable
and preventable elements of pollution such as noise, smoke, soot, particulates, or any
other discharge into the environment which might prove harmful to persons,
structures, or adjacent properties; and (4) inadequate provision for fire safety,
prevention, and control;
b. Provide for the harmonious and aesthetically pleasing development of the
municipality and its environs and to promote the goal of maintaining the rural
character of the Town; (Rev. 11/95)
c. Provide for open spaces and green spaces of adequate proportions and of adequate
visibility from public streets, roads, or subdivided and/or developed residential areas;
(Rev. 11/95)
d. Require the proper arrangement and coordination of streets within the site in relation
to other existing or planned streets or with features of the official map of the
municipality;
e. Require suitably located streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and
prospective traffic and to afford adequate light, air, and access for fire fighting
apparatus and equipment to buildings, and be coordinated so as to compose a
convenient system;
f. Require in proper cases, that plats showing new streets or narrowing or widening of
such streets be submitted to the Planning Board for approval;
g. Require that the land indicated on plats submitted to the Planning Board shall be of
such character that it can be used for building purposes without danger to health; and
h. Include such provisions as will tend to create conditions favorable for health, safety,
convenience, and prosperity.

(any structure containing in excess of two dwelling units) whether or not such
development includes a subdivision or re-subdivision of the site.
3.2 RELATIONSHIP TO OTHER REQUIREMENTS:
3.2.1 Compliance with Other Regulations:
The Site Plan Review procedure in no way relieves the applicant from compliance with
or approval under the provisions of the Town's Zoning Ordinance, Subdivision
Regulations, Building Codes, and/or other regulations which pertain to or govern the
proposed development. No Site Plan will be approved unless it is in compliance with all
pertinent ordinances and regulations.
In cases where a variance is required from the Zoning Ordinance, the applicant shall first
present the plan to the Planning Board so as to allow the Board to render a decision at a
public hearing. (Rev. 7/89) (Rev. 8/99) (Rev. 6/00)
At the Applicant’s request, the Planning Board may, at its sole discretion, waive the
general requirements for a complete application, in accordance with these regulations, in
order to advance the application to the Zoning Board of Appeals. Said waivers would be
granted for the sole purpose of accepting the application, thereby providing the Board
with jurisdiction to render a formal decision on the plan. Waivers of any or all of these
general requirements shall be granted on a one time only basis and shall not be

may waive the requirement for Planning Board action within the time periods specified
and consent to such extension as may be mutually agreeable.
Upon failure of the Planning Board to approve or disapprove within sixty-five (65) days
(or within additional days, if granted by the Selectmen), the applicant may obtain from
the Selectmen an order directing the Planning Board to act within thirty (30) days.
Failure of the Planning Board to act upon such order shall constitute grounds for action in
the Superior Court in accordance with RSA 676:4.
4.4.1 Public Hearing and Notice (deleted 1/01)
4.5 BOARD ACTION: (Rev. 11/93) (Revised 06/07)
Within the appropriate time frames as established by NH RSA 676:4, the Board shall
approve, conditionally approve, approve with conditions, table or disapprove the
application. The reasons for disapproval of a plan shall be stated in the record of the
Board. Approval of a plan shall be endorsed on the plan by the Chairman or Vice Chair
of the Board. The time to act may be extended in accordance with NH RSA 676:4-f.
4.5.1 Conditional Approval:
All conditional approvals are valid for a period of not more than 120 days, unless the
Planning Board, at their discretion, chooses to extend the number of days required to
meet precedent conditions. All precedent conditions of approval must be met within this
120-day period (or time period established by the Planning Board at time of conditional
approval) or the approval shall be considered null and void. In cases where extenuating
circumstances prevent the meeting of precedent conditions within 120 days, the applicant
may request an extension, to be filed (in writing and with justification) with the Board no
later than 14 days prior to the expiration date of the conditions. The Planning Board shall
then vote on whether or not to grant such extensions.
4.5.2 Approval with Conditions:
The Board may attach reasonable conditions to ensure that the public interest is upheld.
Such conditions may include, but are not limited to the following:
a. The posting of a performance guarantee (in the form of a bond, passbook, or cash
only) in an amount and under conditions satisfactory to the Planning Board; (Rev. 8/91)
b. The execution of a written agreement stating the nature, conditions, and time for
performance of the approved application;

portions to be approved subsequently are clearly delineated on the documents to be
filed with the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds;
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 19 of 62
d. Any other conditions that the Planning Board finds necessary to secure the public
interest.
4.5.3 Table:
If the Planning Board finds that certain administrative/procedural requirements have
not been met or additional investigative studies are needed, the Planning Board may
table the application to a time certain.
If such a finding is made, the Planning Board shall advise the applicant in writing what
is necessary to correct the administrative/procedural defect or what investigative studies
are needed.
4.5.4 Disapproval:
If the Planning Board finds that the application does not meet the standards of these
Regulations, fails to comply with other local or State laws, or will have an adverse
impact on surrounding areas or the community, the Planning Board shall disapprove the
application. (Rev. 8/99)
In the event of disapproval, the grounds for disapproval shall be specified in the records
of the Board and communicated to the applicant in writing. If the Board denies an
application, based on the need for a variance or special exception, the applicant may
appeal the decision to the Stratham Zoning Board of Adjustment per Section XVII of
the Stratham Zoning Ordinance. The granting of said variance or special exception by
the Zoning Board of Adjustment does not relieve the applicant from the need to obtain
Planning Board approval for the site plan. (Rev. 8/99)
4.5.5 Building Permit Time Limitations
All certified (signed by the Planning Board Chair or Vice Chair) site plans must obtain
a building permit within 1 year from the date the plan was signed. Failure to obtain a
building permit within 1 year will render the approval null and void. In cases where
extenuating circumstances prevent the receipt of a building permit within 1 year, the
applicant may request an extension of not more than 1 additional year. Such request
must be filed (in writing and with justification) with the Board no later than 14 days
prior to expiration. The Planning Board shall then vote on whether or not to grant such
extensions.
4.5.6 Vesting
Approved site plans shall be protected from future changes in regulations and
ordinances in accordance with NH RSA 674:39 as summarized by the following:
a. Every site plan approved by the Planning Board shall be exempt from all subsequent
changes in Site Plan Regulations and Zoning Ordinances adopted by the Town of
Stratham, except those regulations and ordinances which expressly protect public
health standards, such as water quality and sewage treatment requirements, for a
period of 4 years after the date of certification of the site plan by the Planning Board;
provided, however, once substantial completion of the improvements as shown on the
plans have occurred in compliance with the approved plans, or the terms of said
approval or unless otherwise stipulated by the Planning Board, the rights of the owner

minimum, preferably one, in order to reduce traffic hazards from turning movements
and installation of traffic control devices.
c. The Planning Board may require improvement of existing access/egress point(s) to
provide safe flow onto abutting streets should increased traffic be generated by the
development.
Any approval or requirements above shall in no way be in lieu of or superior to any
approval or permit which may be granted by the State of New Hampshire Department
of Public Works and Highways in any case where that body has preemptive
jurisdiction.
d. Off-site requirements may be required, such as pavement width, deceleration lanes,
curbing, or signal devices.
The Planning Board, at its sole discretion, may require the developer of the subject
property to install granite curbing on all frontages facing public thoroughfares. The
curbing shall be installed in accordance with the State of New Hampshire Department
of Transportation specifications. (Rev. 6/00)
In the event that the State, County or Town has documented plans to adjust the
frontage roads within three years of the submission of the site plan, the developer
may not be required to install the curbing specified prior to site plan approval. In lieu
of such installation, the developer must post a bond with the Town in an amount
equal to 125% of an estimate for curbing installation provided by the Town Highway
Agent. The Town will have the right to require installation of the curbing at any time,
without regard to Federal, State, or Town road improvement plans. (Rev. 11/95)
The Planning Board, at its sole discretion, may require the developer of General
Commercial (GCM), Professional/Residential (PRE), Town Center (TC), Commercial
Light Industrial Office (CLIO) and Retirement Planned Community (RPC) zoned

5.2 LANDSCAPE DESIGN STANDARDS:
A. The existing landscape of Stratham is diverse, containing natural wooded
environments, orchards and open fields, as well as marsh, wetlands and streams.
New development should be respectful and sensitive to the dominant landscape
character of Stratham as a whole.
B. Purpose:
The purpose of landscaping design standards in Stratham is to:
1. Preserve and enhance the character of Stratham’s landscape.
2. Enhance the goals of the Master Plan, and provide attractive settings for new
development, which promotes aesthetically pleasing relationship of scale between
buildings and their natural surroundings.
3. Preserve and enhance local and regional open space resources.
4. Support and encourage the use of sustainable design principles and operating
practices that preserve and enhance wildlife habitats, water quality, and overall
health of the natural environment.
5. Encourage the use of indigenous plant material to provide natural habitat and food
sources and to maintain ecological diversity.
6. Retain mature vegetation in place or transplant and reuse it on site to the greatest
extent feasible and reinforce the visual image of Stratham through the planting of
shade trees along roadways, the installation of underground utilities, and the
design of “monument or pedestal” signage.
7. Enhance the visual impact of public spaces and promote “pedestrian friendly”
environments by including sidewalks, barrier-free street crossings, public
benches, and bicycle racks.
8. Offer adequate buffering between abutting parcels and to protect neighboring
properties from potentially adverse impacts of structures, lighting glare, noise,
wind velocities, and odors.
9. Provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of pavement and define
pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
10. Enhance the natural drainage of the site and facilitate the reintegration of
stormwater run-off on the site.
C. General Requirements:
1. All required landscaping shall be located entirely within the lot, unless
agreements have been made with the Town for landscaping in the road right-ofway.
2. Landscaping and screening must be provided with proper regard to adjacent
properties, the public highway and within the site, including interior landscaping
of parking areas. The proposed landscape design must be sensitive to any wellexecuted
and maintained adjoining property landscape design. The landscape
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 23 of 62
design, as submitted to the Planning Board, shall indicate prominent landscape
elements on adjoining properties within 25 feet abutting the subject site. A
minimum of 60% of the required open space on any lot shall be readily visible
from public streets, roads, or subdivided and/or developed residential areas.
3. Where the site abuts residential property, activity on the subject property shall be
screened to a reasonable level from the residential property by appropriate
landscaping, including the use of plant materials, and/or existing natural
vegetation. Fencing alone will not be considered an acceptable method of
screening. (Rev. 11/95)
4. Buffer strips of at least twenty-five (25) feet minimum width, or more, if required
by the Zoning Ordinance, must be provided where a proposed non-residential
development abuts residential properties. Where appropriate, existing growth
must be incorporated into the buffer strips or landscaping design. Buffer strips
must contain vegetation, which will screen the view from adjacent residential
property during all seasons. (Rev. 7/89)
5. The use of native plant varieties or the cultivars of natives is encouraged. Plants
shall be selected for their ability to thrive in the environment encountered and for
their ability to achieve a desired effect. In addition:
a. Plants shall be installed in contiguous planting beds in masses of three or
more so as to appear more natural.
b. Plant varieties shall be selected to ensure long-term survival.
c. Plant varieties shall be selected so as to reduce long-term maintenance.

11. Landscaping shall be laid out in informal drifts rather than formal rows and shall
undulate with site topography. Individual clusters of trees or islands of shrub beds
are acceptable as long as the tree clusters and/or shrub islands overlap. Linear
solutions shall be avoided wherever possible.
12. The applicant may request that the Planning Board determine whether existing
vegetation is suitably located, sufficiently dense, and vigorous enough to be
substituted in lieu of new planting required by these regulations.
13. Plant material located within 20 feet of any road or other paved area shall consist
of only those plants tolerant of roadway deicing salts.
14. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition. If within one year from the
date of installation any plant is in a deteriorating state or is dead it shall be
replaced in kind in a timely manner.
15. No person shall deface, alter the location of, or remove any stonewall which was
made for the purpose of delineating a boundary or border of a lot, road or right of

separate land uses or provide a natural backdrop for development.
19. Use plantings to enhance the relationship of buildings to their surroundings.
a. Layered plantings soften edges and corners and reduce the scale of buildings
in the landscape.
b. Masses of trees and vegetation near buildings reduce the perceived scale of
buildings and set them into the landscape.
c. Trees shall have a 3”caliper minimum at the time of planting.
d. Consider plant massing along with architectural massing during the design
process.
e. Balance the mass, proportion and rhythm of landscape and building elements.
Minimize lawn area, as most lawn grasses require supplemental irrigation and
regular applications of fertilizer to stay green.
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 27 of 62
18. Where lawn is necessary favor fescues and other drought tolerant species.
D. Preservation of Existing Vegetation
1. Buildings, parking, loading docks, access roads, and other site elements shall be
sited to preserve existing healthy mature vegetation and maintain natural
topography to the maximum extent feasible.
2. Healthy trees with a minimum 12-inch caliper, and existing wooded areas are
recommended for preservation, particularly those trees located within setback
areas where buildings cannot be constructed.
3. Construction activities and site alterations shall not disturb the root zone of the
trees designated for preservation. During construction, the applicant shall install
and maintain tree protection fencing, or other protective measures approved by
the Planning Board, located 12 inches off the drip-line of the trees to be protected.
All no-cut zones shall be appropriately monumented and delineated on the site
plan.
4. The applicant shall be responsible to replace any trees designated to remain,
which have been damaged, killed, or removed as a result of construction
activities. The Planning Board shall require replacement-in-kind, per caliper inch
of deciduous trees and by height for evergreens. Two-inch caliper deciduous
trees and 4-foot tall evergreens shall be the minimum size used for replacement.
For example, if a 24-inch caliper deciduous tree is damaged or killed during
construction, the applicant shall replace the tree with six 4-inch caliper trees, or
any other combination that adds up to 24 caliper inches. A 36-foot tall evergreen,
for example shall be replaced with six 6 foot tall evergreen, or any other
combination adding up to 36 feet.
E. Screening
1. Screening shall be a year-round visually impermeable barrier that may be
existing, constructed, or a combination thereof.
a. Existing screens may consist of natural topographic landforms, rock outcrops,
or vegetation that is dense enough to be visually impermeable.
b. Constructed screens may consist of built screens, such as walls or fences,
topographic screens, such as berms or landforms, vegetative screens
consisting of primarily evergreen material, or a combination thereof.
2. Screening is required to soften the visual impact of buildings, parking areas,
loading docks, trash disposal areas, exterior storage, and other unsightly areas
associated with or generated by a particular development as viewed from a public
right-of-way, residential zoning districts, and the principal entrances of buildings
on abutting lots.
3. The use of existing vegetation, topography, and natural features to comply with
screening requirements is encouraged.
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 28 of 62
4. Vegetative screens shall achieve a minimum of 75% vertical opacity to a height of
6 feet, year-round, within one year of installation. Screens shall not be located so
as to impede vehicular or pedestrian traffic.

1. Minimum one shade tree per 40’ frontage; minimum 3” caliper may substitute one
new tree for each existing tree over 3” caliper preserved within strip.
2. Minimum tree height equal to 1/2 proposed building height.
3. Buffer strip should include a combination of deciduous and/or evergreen trees and
shrubs, grass, fences, berms and walls.
H. Parking Areas
1. Planting islands should be used to define vehicular and pedestrian circulation
patterns, to break up large expanses of pavement and to facilitate site drainage. In
general, islands should be distributed throughout the parking lot. A combination
of end cap islands and linear islands running parallel to parking rows are
preferred. Islands should include trees and be planted with either grass or
evergreen shrubs and shall be designed to absorb run-off from the parking areas.
2. There shall be landscaped open space within the parameter of the parking areas in
the minimum amount of 5 % of the gross parking area.
3. Provide minimum area of 200 sf per landscaped island and at least one tree per
island; trees must be minimum 4’ from curbing.
4. Divider islands. Provide at least one island for every four parking rows at least 10
ft. wide; space trees not more than 50 ft. apart in each contiguous landscape area;
or provide one tree per 200 sf of ground area.
5. Terminal islands. Provide at ends of parking rows at least every 25 spaces;
provide at least two trees per island and evergreen shrubs 3’ on center, or
grass/ground cover with approval of Planning Board. All landscape areas shall
contain shrub and ground cover plantings. They may not be totally covered with
mulch.

public access.
J. Signage Landscape Strip
1. Require minimum 4’ wide area around each freestanding sign.
2. Existing vegetation, which is preserved, may be substituted for required plantings.
K. Soil Preparation
Landscaped areas where soil compaction has occurred due to construction activities
should be deep tilled to a depth of 12 inches to facilitate deep-water penetration and
soil oxygenation. Use of soil amendments is encouraged to improve water drainage,
moisture penetration, soil oxygenation, and/or water holding capacity. Soil
amendments are organic matter such as compost, Biosolids, and forest by products,
but do not include topsoil or any mix with soil as an element.
For all newly landscaped areas, organic matter (3-4 cubic yards of organic matter per
1,000 square feet of landscape area) should be incorporated to a depth of 4 to 6
inches. Organic content of landscaped soils shall not be less than 18% by volume in
the top 6 inches of the finished topsoil.
For newly landscaped areas where topsoil is limited or nonexistent, or where soil
drainage is impeded due to subsurface hardpan or bedrock, 6 to 24 inches of sandy
loam topsoil should be spread in all planting and turf areas, in addition to the
incorporation of organic matter into the top horizon of the imported soil. Organic
content of landscaped soils shall not be less than 18% by volume in the top 6 inches
of the finished topsoil.
Soil analysis of new or renovated turf areas should include a determination of soil
texture, including percentage of organic matter; an approximated soil infiltration rate;
and a measure of pH value.
L. Mulching
1. Mulch should be applied regularly to, and maintained in all, planting areas to
assist soils in retaining moisture, reducing weed growth, and minimizing erosion.
Mulches include organic materials such as wood chips, compost and shredded
bark and inert organic materials such as decomposed lava rock, coble, and gravel.
If weed barrier mats are used, the use of organic mulches is recommended. Nonporous
materials, such as plastic sheeting, are not recommended for use in any
areas of the landscaping because of down-slope erosion potential soil
contamination from herbicide washing and increased runoff coefficients.
Mulches should be applied to the following depths; 3 inches over bare soil, and 2
inches where plant material will cover. Mulches for stormwater management
areas should be heavier and not of a type that will float away.
M. Maintenance
1. The owner of any lot shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaped
open space, natural screens, and constructed screens within the lot. Landscaping
shall be maintained in good condition such that planting shall be vigorous and in
good health at all times and that the parcel shall present a healthy, neat, and
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 30 of 62
orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris. Any dead vegetation that is part
of the approved landscaping design shall be replaced within one year.
2. Landscaping shall be maintained so that it does not interfere with sight distances
at driveways.
3. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may require a landscape maintenance and
water management plan. The maintenance plan shall include, but not be limited
to the following:
i. Integrated Turf Management: mowing schedule, weed control, pest control,
soil pH management, fertilizer plan, aeration/dethatching schedule and
repair/replacement plan.
ii. Shrub and Groundcover Management: mulch schedule, weed control, pruning

sprinkler system and/or hose bibs placed at appropriate locations and
intervals. Wherever possible, irrigation water shall be derived from sources
other than a public water system, including “gray water,” re-used water,
detained stormwater or roof drainage. “Gray water” is water from sinks,
showers, dishwashers, and washing machines. On-site cisterns may be
installed to store water for irrigation.
v. Seasonal Maintenance: Spring clean-up plan, fall clean-up plan, disposal plans
for leaves and plant debris, winter plowing plan, winter deicing plan.
4. Provide a landscape maintenance bond for one year.

mechanical noise, such that the noise level on abutting properties will not exceed 60
decibels. (Rev. 11/95)
5.8.1 Illumination: (Adopted 08/01)
This regulation is intended to reduce the problems created by improperly designed and
installed outdoor lighting for non-residential development. It is intended to eliminate
problems of glare, minimize light trespass minimize obtrusive light, protect the quality of
the New Hampshire night sky, Stratham’s rural character, and conserve energy and
resources while maintaining safety, security and productivity by establishing regulations
which limit the area that certain kinds of outdoor-lighting fixtures can illuminate and by
limiting the total allowable illumination of lots located in the Town of Stratham.
a. Definitions:
For the purposes of this Regulation, terms used shall be defined as follows:
Cut-off Angle (of a luminaire) - The angle formed by a line drawn from the direction
of the direct light rays at the light source with respect to the vertical, beyond which no
direct light is emitted.
Direct Light: Light emitted directly from the lamp, off of the reflector or reflector
diffuser, or through the refractor or diffuser lens, of a luminaire.
Fixture: The assembly that houses the lamp or lamps and can include all or some of
the following parts: a housing, a mounting bracket or pole socket, a lamp holder, a
ballast, a reflector or mirror, and/or a refractor or lens.
Flood or Spot Light: Any light fixture or lamp that incorporates a reflector or a
refractor to concentrate the light output into a directed beam in a particular direction.
Foot-Candle: A unit of illuminance amounting to one lumen per square foot. A
measure of light falling on a given surface. One foot-candle is equal to the amount of
light generated by one candle shining on a square foot surface one foot away.
Fully Shielded: A fully shielded luminaire is a luminaire constructed or shielded in
such a manner that all light emitted by the luminaire, either directly from the lamp or
indirectly from the luminaire, is projected below an angle of 20 degrees below the
horizontal plane through the luminaire’s lowest light emitting part as determined by
photometric test or certified by the manufacturer.
Glare: Light emitting from a luminaire with an intensity great enough to reduce a
viewer's ability to see, and in extreme cases causing momentary blindness.
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 34 of 62
Height of Luminaire: The height of a luminaire shall be the vertical distance from the
ground directly below the centerline of the luminaire to the lowest direct-lightemitting
part of the luminaire.
Illuminance: The quantity of light arriving at a surface divided by the area of the
illuminated surface, measured in foot-candles.
Lamp: The component of a luminaire that produces the actual light.
Light Trespass: The shining of light produced by a luminaire beyond the boundaries
of the property on which it is located.
Lumen: A measure of light energy generated by a light source. One footcandle is
one lumen per square foot. For the purposes of this Regulation, the lumen-output
values shall be the INITIAL lumen output ratings of a lamp.
Luminaire: This is a complete lighting system, and includes a lamp or lamps and a
fixture.
Outdoor Lighting: The night-time illumination of an outside area or object by any
man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means.
Partially Shielded: Shall mean outdoor light fixtures shielded or constructed so that
no more than ten percent of the light rays are emitted by the installed fixture at angles
greater than 20 degrees below the horizontal plan, and shall not extend above the
horizontal plane, as certified by a photometry test report.
Temporary Outdoor Lighting: The specific illumination of an outside area of object
by any man-made device located outdoors that produces light by any means for a
period of less than 7 days, with at least 180 days passing before being used again.
Uplighting: Any light source that distributes illumination above a 90-degree
horizontal plane.
b. General Lighting Requirements:
i. Illumination levels at property boundaries will not exceed 0.3 foot-candles, except
when a property abuts a residential lot where illumination levels shall not exceed
0.2 foot-candles at the shared boundary;
ii. All lighting in the Town of Stratham is required to be fully shielded.;
iii. Up-lighting by any method is prohibited; however, the Planning Board may allow
limited use of upward landscape lighting on a case by case basis;
iv. Non-cutoff wallpack type fixtures are prohibited.
c. Control of Glare – Luminaire Design Factors:

through parking lots and other facilities as are appropriate for the site.
6. Bicycle Parking.
a. Off-street bicycle parking may be required by the Planning Board in the General
Commercial, Gateway Commercial Business District, and Town Center Zoning
Districts whenever any new use is established or any existing use is enlarged for
which more than ten (10) automobile parking spaces are required. If required by the
Planning Board, the quantity of required bicycle stalls will be determined as shown in
Table below:
Tabular Bicycle Parking Requirements

the bikes in a stable upright position so that a bike, if bumped, will not fall or roll
down.
i. Racks that support a bike primarily by a wheel, such as standard 'wire racks' are
damaging to wheels and thus are not acceptable.
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 43 of 62
j. Bicycle parking racks, shelters or lockers must be securely anchored to the ground or
to a structure.

(20) feet in a residential district and twenty-five (25) feet in a nonresidential.
9. Signage
a. Adequate directional signage shall be provided, per the Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices for Streets and Highways, as most recently published.
10. Mitigating the Impacts of Parking Lots.
a. As a supplement to the parking lot landscaping standards contained in the Section 5.2,
a minimum percentage of the overall interior area of a parking lot (as measured by the
exterior perimeter) shall be dedicated to landscaped areas (to be included on the
landscape plans) with ground cover, shrubbery, and trees, as appropriate, as follows:
i. 10% on parking lots located in front of the principal building or on otherwise
vacant lots.
ii. 8% on parking lots located on the side of the principal building, set back from the
front boundary line at least even with the front of the principal building.
iii. 5% on parking lots which are located at the rear of the principal building and
largely obscured from the road.
b. Landscaping within parking areas shall provide visual and climatic relief from broad
expanses of pavement and shall be designed to channel and define logical areas for
pedestrian and vehicular circulation.
c. Internal parking lot landscaping, as required by item “a”, above, shall contain one
deciduous shade tree for every 15 parking spaces. Trees shall be distributed
throughout the parking lot as evenly as possible. Trees shall be set back at least 5 feet
minimum from the face of the curb. Tree placement and parking lot lighting shall not
conflict. Interior parking lot landscaping may be waived in truck parking areas
provided they are screened and perimeter plantings, as described in items e-g below,
are provided.
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 44 of 62
d. All landscaped areas shall be protected from encroachment by vehicles by curbing,
landscaping timbers, curb stops, or other acceptable means.
e. Shade trees shall be provided around the perimeter of all parking areas at a minimum
ratio of 1 tree per 20 feet of parking lot perimeter. In portions of parking areas where
screening is required, shade trees shall be provided along the perimeter at a minimum
ration of 1 tree per 50 feet of parking lot perimeter in addition to the required
screening.
f. All off-street parking areas located at the front or side of principal buildings or on
vacant lots shall be screened from the public right-of-way with appropriate screening.
g. Screening from Residences: All off-street parking areas shall be screened from
abutting residences or vacant lots in residential zoning districts located at the side or
rear of the property with a wall, fence, vegetation or other means deemed appropriate.
11. Alternative Parking Standards.
a. To encourage better overall site design, improve the management and efficient use of
parking facilities, and reduce the dependency upon automobiles, the Planning Board
may allow deviations from the parking requirements set forth in Section 5.9.2 The
Planning Board will make a determination that the relief does not cause detriment to
the surrounding neighborhood and/or roadway system based upon any of the
following applicable criteria:
i. Increase in traffic volumes;
ii. Increased traffic congestion or queuing of vehicles;
iii. Change in the type(s) of traffic;
iv. Change in traffic patterns and access to the site;
v. Reduction in on-street parking; and/or,
vi. Unsafe conflict of motor vehicle and pedestrian traffic.
b. The following additional guidelines and standards are offered:
i. Modification of Parking Requirements for Non-Conforming Structures and Lots.
Where the total number of parking spaces required by this regulation is five (5) or
fewer for lots or sites that are determined by the Building Inspector to be
nonconforming with respect to parking.
ii. Municipal Parking Facility.
To allow the substitution of space on a particular lot with parking spaces located
within a municipal parking lot to satisfy the parking requirements of this Section,
provided the municipal parking lot where such parking spaces are located is
within a distance of four hundred (400) feet of the building or use (measured from
property line to property line), which is intended to be served and demonstration
that doing so will not exceed the cumulative peak demand of said municipal
parking lot in a manner which is inconsistent with the objectives of this Section.
iii. Parking on a Separate Lot / Satellite Parking.
1. Required off-street parking facilities shall be provided on the same lot or
premises as the principal use they are intended to serve, or on a lot in the same
ownership adjacent to such use. When practical difficulties, as determined by
the Planning Board, preclude the establishment of the required parking spaces
on such lot or premises (or lot or premises adjacent thereto), the Planning
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 45 of 62
Board may allow the establishment of parking on such other lot upon such
terms and conditions as the Planning Board may deem necessary to ensure the
continued availability of such spaces.
2. Where the applicant does not own such other lot, the applicant shall provide
executed instruments establishing to the satisfaction of the Planning Board
that sufficient legal interest has been acquired in such premises to assure their
availability for required parking as long as the use served is in existence. The
provision of satellite (remote) parking areas, provided that:
a. The satellite parking spaces will be used solely by the employees and,
where practicable, the clientele of the non-residential use;
b. The off-site parking spaces shall be located to adequately serve the
proposed use and shall be within four hundred (400) feet of the property
served for clientele of the commercial use as measured from property line
to property line;
iv. Common Parking Areas and Multiple Use Facilities.
a. Notwithstanding the normal provisions of this Section, where two or more
activities or uses provide the required parking or loading in a common parking
facility or loading area, the number of parking spaces or loading bays
ordinarily required may be reduced below the sum of the spaces or bays
required for separate activities or uses, if it can be determined that the hours,
days, or peak parking or loading demand for the uses are so different that a
lower total will provide adequately for all uses or activities served by the
parking facility or loading bay, and that the location of the parking facility in
relation to the uses proposed to be served by it is appropriate.
b. Deviation from the normal standard shall only be granted upon submission of
calculated parking demand for combined land uses based on methodologies
and indices of the Institute of Transportation Engineers, Urban Land Institute,
or other recognized methodology approved in writing by the Planning Board.
A formal parking demand study may be waived by the Planning Board for
small developments where there is established experience with the land use
mix and its impact is expected to be minimal.
c. Where such facilities are shared by more than two (2) owners, the applicant
shall provide executed and filed instruments with the Registry of Deeds
establishing to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that sufficient legal
interest has been acquired in such premises to assure that the property(s) have
a shared parking arrangement or peak hour parking arrangement and the
availability for required parking as long as the uses served are in existence.
v. Land Banked Parking.
a. To reduce the area of impervious surface, encourage open space,
accommodate future changes in land use and/or ownership, and shifts in
shared parking demand, up to forty percent (40%) of the land area that would
otherwise be needed to provide the required amount of parking may be land
banked or set aside on the site to provide for the future construction of a
parking area.
b. The parking facility shall be designed/engineered to enable the site to satisfy
the requirements of this Section to meet the peak demands of the project(s) or
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 46 of 62
use(s). Where it can be demonstrated by the applicant in the future that there
is a need to convert all or a portion of the land-banked parking facilities
because parking demand is in excess of 80% of parking supply on the
property, then the applicant may convert the requisite number of land banked
parking spaces to functioning parking spaces.
c. For purposes hereof, parking demand shall be demonstrated through a report
of the applicant’s (or the then current owner’s traffic engineering consultant),
as the case may be, certifying that at any time during the four-hour peak
demand period on a weekday or Saturday, the actual parking demand and
utilization is in excess of 80% of parking supply on the property, with actual
field site observations being conducted on two separate days during any
consecutive 45-day period.
d. Upon the Planning Board’s determination the applicant has established the
requisite parking need, and upon submission of the report to the Planning
Board, the Planning Board may allow the conversion of all or a portion of the
land-banked parking.
vi. Reduction in Parking.
a. Where it can be demonstrated that a use or establishment needs a lesser
number of parking spaces or loading bays than is required by this Section,
such as housing for persons with disabilities, low rate of vehicle ownership,
the availability and implementation of transportation demand management
alternatives, or other such circumstances as may be deemed appropriate by the
Planning Board, the number of such parking spaces or bays may be reduced
by not more than thirty percent (30%).
b. An applicant shall submit documentary evidence satisfactory to the Planning
Board that the parking or loading experience of the specific use justifies a
lesser number of spaces or bays.
c. This allowance shall lapse upon change to a different type of use unless

instruments to insure their continued maintenance and ownership, any such instruments
being subject to approval by the Town Attorney and Board of Selectmen. (Rev. 7/89)
5.15 ARCHITECTURAL PLANS:
No building permit shall be granted for a commercial building unless architectural
elevations and a building footprint depicting exterior features drawn to scale meet all of
the requirements of the Planning Board. Specifications shall have been filed with and
approved by the Planning Board. (Rev. 8/99)
As documented in the 1985 and subsequent Stratham Master Plans, a majority of the
residents of Stratham prefer that the character of the town maintain a rural, residential,
countrified flavor. This preference is represented in the scale of commercial
development to residential/agricultural development desired, and in the aesthetic
characteristics of the buildings and structures that have been developed. To this end, the
Site Plan Review Regulations have been amended to require building design that
incorporates significant features representing a rural New England colonial design theme.
(Rev. 11/95)
The Stratham Planning Board strongly believes that by reviewing the building design and
holding the applicant to stringent design standards, the integrity and character of the
community will be preserved, the property values will be maintained and the community
will benefit from aesthetically pleasing, high quality development along major
transportation corridors within Stratham. (Rev. 11/95)
The features in the design of buildings, structures and outbuildings noted below shall be
required in the Professional/Residential (PRE), Town Center (TC), General Commercial
(GCM), Commercial Light Industrial Office (CLIO) and Retirement Planned Community
(RPC) - all districts located along Portsmouth Avenue corridor and extremely visible to
the general public. The Planning Board strongly encourages applicants to consider and
include these design features within the Industrial (IND) district however, due to the lack
of visibility by the general public, these standards are not mandatory within the Industrial
District. (Rev. 11/95) (Rev. 8/99) The design features shall include:
a. Pitched roofs of at least a 4:12 pitch; (Rev. 11/95) (Rev. 8/99)
b. Roofing materials and roofing colors in keeping with the New England theme; (Rev.
11/95)
c. Building components, such as windows, doors, and eaves that are adequately
proportioned. Use of multiple paned windows is encouraged; (Rev. 11/95)
d. Exterior cladding materials allowed are clapboard, shakes, brick, plaster, stone or
other similar materials or similar fabricated materials. Disallowed is the use of
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019

prefabricated metal, concrete blocks, T-111 plywood, or other similar materials; (Rev.
11/95)
e. Exterior colors in muted tones, with no more than 15% of any exterior face of the
buildings(s), including the roof, in an overly bright color. Colors to be implemented
in the design will be specified on the architect’s drawing, and a color board shall be
submitted to the Planning Board prior to site plan approval; (Rev. 11/95)
f. All buildings and outbuildings shall be designed by a professional, registered
architect; (Rev. 11/95)
g. No mechanical equipment incorporated on or in the building, including electrical,
plumbing, heating, ventilation, and air conditioning equipment and antennas shall be
exposed to view. (Rev. 11/95) Such elements shall be appropriately screened by
incorporation in the building design;
h. Whether attached to the building or freestanding from the building, the following
items shall be completely architecturally screened and clad with materials similar to
the building(s):
i. Trash dumpsters and compactors;
ii. Surface mounted mechanical equipment;
iii. Material storage areas;
iv. Above ground storage tanks (Rev. 11/95)
i. Vehicle entry doors will not be located on the front or side faces of the building(s).
Where these vehicle entry doors face to residential property, these doors shall be
screened, taking into account the proximity and exposure to the residential property;
(Rev. 11/95)
j. The front, sides, and rear of the building(s) shall be attractively designed and
articulated to eliminate large spans of blank exterior wall. (Rev. 11/95)
The Architectural Plan shall indicate:
i. The architectural design of the exterior of the building;
ii. The type of windows and doors to be installed on the building;
iii. The type of building material to be used on the exterior walls of the building.
5.16 OPEN SPACE SETBACK: (Rev. 11/95)
Furthermore, it should be noted that in addition to the building setbacks contained in the
Stratham Zoning Ordinance, all paving, except for walks and approved drive entries,
shall be set back a minimum of 35 feet from the front property line, with an average
setback no less than 50 feet from the front property line. Setbacks shall be measured
along a line parallel to the front property line, with said line beginning 25 feet from side
property lines.

not limited to construction of roads, drainage infrastructure, utilities and other structures
or development that support the subdivision.
2. Development on residential lots shall incorporate best management practices from the
NHDES Homeowners Guide to Stormwater Management (2011, as amended), NH
Stormwater Manual. Volumes 1 and 2, December 2008 as amended (or most current
version), and the 2017 NH Small MS4 General Permit to manage and treat runoff.
3. The provisions and standards of this Addendum are implemented for the purpose of:
? Managing stormwater runoff to protect water quality and quantity.
? Causing no increase in contribution of a pollutant for which a water body is impaired.
? Treating new runoff discharged to a municipal drainage system, surface water
body or wetland.
? Resulting in no discharge of runoff to properties in excess of runoff discharged in
the existing developed or undeveloped condition.
A. APPLICABILITY STANDARDS
i. These standards apply to all projects subject to Site Plan Review Regulations or
Subdivision Regulations. Additionally, all applications will be required to
include a post-construction stormwater management plan prepared by a NH
licensed engineer.
ii. All projects under review by the Planning Board of such magnitude as to require
a stormwater permit from EPA Construction General Permit (CGP) program or
NH Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) Alteration of Terrain
(AOT) program shall comply with the standards of EPA and/or NHDES permits
and this section, whereas the stricter standards shall apply.
B. MINIMUM THRESHOLDS FOR APPICABILITY
i. Minimum Thresholds for Applicability: These stormwater management
standards apply to all projects requiring Planning Board review and approval
under the Subdivision or Site Plan Review Regulations. For smaller projects that
disturb less than 43,560 square feet an applicant may request a waiver of the full
standards providing minimum protections and management are implemented.
For the purpose of these standards, disturbance is defined as any alteration of the
land surface or permanent removal of vegetation or trees associated with a
development activity (refer to the Definitions, below).
ii. Waiver Option for Small Development Projects: At the request of an applicant,
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 56 of 62
the Planning Board may grant a waiver to any or all stormwater standards for
projects that: disturb less than 43,560 square feet; create less than 20,000 square
feet of new impervious surface; and do not disturb land within 100 feet of a
surface water body or wetland comprised of less than 5,000 square feet based on
wetland delineation.
iii. Conditions for Granting of Waivers: In order for the Planning Board to issue a
waiver, the applicant must demonstrate and board must find the application
meets the minimum criteria listed below and, if granted, will be considered
conditions of approval:
i. Runoff from new impervious surfaces shall be directed to a filtration
and/or infiltration device.
ii. Impervious surfaces for parking areas and roads should be minimized to
the extent possible (including minimum parking requirements for
proposed uses and minimum road widths).
iii. Runoff generated from new impervious surfaces should be retained on
the development site and mimic natural hydrology.
iv. Compliance with standards 3.a-3.c above will be determined by the
Planning Board on a case by case basis as site conditions and constraints
will differ greatly between various redevelopment proposals.
C. BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES
i. Performance Specifications: Stormwater management will meet or exceed
requirements for the 2017 NH Small MS4 General Permit. All proposed
stormwater practices and measures shall be installed and maintained in
accordance with manufacturers’ specifications and performance specifications in
the NH Stormwater Management Manual Volume 2 (December 2008 or current
revision) a copy of which is available from the NHDES website at
www.des.nh.gov/organization/divisions/water/stormwater/manual.htm
ii. Water Quality Protection: All aspects of the application shall be designed to
protect the quality of surface waters and groundwater of the Town of Stratham as
follows:
iii. All storage facilities for fuel, chemicals, chemical or industrial wastes,
and biodegradable raw materials shall meet the regulations of the New
Hampshire Department of Environmental Services (NHDES) including but not
limited to those involving Underground Storage Tanks (UST), Above Ground
Storage Tanks, hazardous Waste and Best Management Practices for
Groundwater Protection (Env-Wa 401).
iv. Stormwater Management for New Development: All proposed stormwater
management and treatment systems shall meet the following performance
standards.
i. Existing surface waters, including lakes, ponds, rivers, perennial and
intermittent streams (natural or channelized), and wetlands (including
vernal pools) shall be protected by the minimum buffer setback distances
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 57 of 62
(as specified in the Zoning and Regulations). Stormwater and erosion and
sediment control BMPs shall be located outside the specified buffer zone
unless otherwise approved by the Planning Board. Alternatives to stream
and wetland crossings that eliminate or minimize environmental impacts
shall be considered whenever possible. When necessary, as determined
by the Planning Board or their representative, stream and wetland
crossings shall comply with state recommended design standards to
minimize impacts to flow and enhance animal passage (see the
University of New Hampshire Stream Crossing Guidelines (May 2009,
as amended) available from the UNH Environmental Research Group
website at
http://www.unh.edu/erg/stream_restoration/nh_stream_crossing_guideline
s_unh_web_rev_2. pdf)
ii. Low Impact Development (LID) site planning and design strategies
should be used in order to reduce the generation of the stormwater runoff
volume for both new development and redevelopment projects (see
Element D for redevelopment standards). An applicant must document in
writing why LID strategies are not appropriate if not used to manage
stormwater.
iii. All stormwater treatment areas should be planted with native plantings
appropriate for the site conditions: grasses, shrubs and/or other native
plants in sufficient numbers and density to prevent soil erosion and to
achieve the water quality treatment requirements of this section.
iv. All areas that receive rainfall runoff should be designed to drain within a
maximum of 72 hours.
v. Salt storage areas should be covered and loading/offloading areas shall
be designed and maintained in accordance with NH DES published
guidance such that no untreated discharge to receiving waters results.
Snow storage areas shall be located in accordance with NH DES
published guidance such that no direct untreated discharges to receiving
waters should be possible. Runoff from snow and salt storage areas shall
enter treatment areas as specified above before being discharged to
receiving waters or allowed to infiltrate into the groundwater. See
NHDES published guidance fact sheets on road salt and water quality,
and snow disposal at
http://des.nh.gov/organization/commissioner/pip/factsheets/wmb/index.ht
m.
vi. Runoff should be directed into recessed vegetated and landscape areas
designed for treatment and/or filtration to minimize Effective Impervious
Cover (EIC) and reduce the need for irrigation systems.
vii. Newly generated stormwater, whether from new development or
expansion of existing development (redevelopment), should be treated on
the development site. Runoff should not be discharged to surface water
bodies or wetlands in excess of volumes discharged under existing
conditions (developed condition or undeveloped condition).
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 58 of 62
viii. A development plan should include provisions to retain stormwater on
the site by using the natural flow patterns of the site. Runoff from
impervious surfaces shall be treated with BMPs AND optimized for
Total Nitrogen (TN) generated from the total post-construction
impervious area as per the 2017 NH Small MS4 Section 2.3.6
Stormwater Management in New Development and Redevelopment (Post
Construction Stormwater Management Section a.ii.d)1)b., and as
specified in the NH Stormwater Manual. Volumes 1 and 2, December
2008 as amended (or most current version) (refer to Volume 2, page 6,
Table 2.1 Summary of Design Criteria, Water Quality Volume for
treatment criteria) or other equivalent means. Where practical, the use of
natural, vegetated filtration and/or infiltration BMPs or subsurface gravel
wetlands for water quality treatment is preferred given its relatively high
nitrogen removal efficiency. Note: The Anti-Degradation provisions of
the State Water Quality Standards require that runoff from new
development shall not lower water quality or contribute to existing water
body impairments.
ix. Measures shall be taken to control the post-development peak rate runoff
so that it does not exceed pre-development runoff for the 2-year, 10-year
and 25-year, 24-hour storm events. Similar measures shall be taken to
control the post-development runoff volume to infiltrate the groundwater
recharge volume GRV according to the current AOT guidelines unless
demonstrated for sites where infiltration is limited or not practicable.
Infiltration structures should be in locations with the highest permeability
on the site.
x. The design of the stormwater drainage system should provide for the
disposal of stormwater without flooding or functional impairment to
streets, adjacent properties, downstream properties, soils, or vegetation.
xi. The design of the stormwater management systems should take into
account upstream and upgradient runoff that flows onto, over, or through
the site to be developed or re-developed, and provide for this contribution
of runoff.
xii. Appropriate erosion and sediment control measures should be installed
prior to any soil disturbance, the area of disturbance shall be kept to a
minimum, and any sediment in runoff shall be retained within the project
area. Wetland areas and surface waters should be protected from
sediment. Disturbed soil areas shall be either temporarily or permanently
stabilized consistent with the NHDES Stormwater Manual Volume 3
guidelines. In areas where final grading has not occurred, temporary
stabilization measures should be in place within 7 days for exposed soil
areas within 100 feet of a surface water body or wetland and no more
than fourteen (14) days for all other areas. Permanent stabilization should
be in place no more than 14 days following the completion of final
grading of exposed soil areas.
xiii. All temporary control measures should be removed after final site
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 59 of 62
stabilization. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting
from the removal of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized
prior to removal of temporary control measures.
xiv. Porous pavements should be considered for feasibility for commercial
and industrial applications for general and overflow parking areas.
Construction quality assurance during installation and production of
porous pavements, and long term operations and maintenance will be
required to ensure success. Pervious pavement shall be appropriately
sited and designed for traffic and vehicle loading conditions. Porous
pavement will generally not be included in the calculation of impervious
surface areas for site development.
xv. Whenever practicable, native site vegetation shall be retained, protected,
or supplemented. Any stripping of vegetation shall be done in a manner
that minimizes soil erosion.
D. REDEVELOPMENT CRITERIA
i. Criteria
1. In order to determine the stormwater requirements for redevelopment projects,
the percentage of the site covered by existing impervious areas must be
calculated. Stormwater requirements for redevelopment will vary based upon
the amount of site surface area that is covered by existing impervious surfaces.
2. For sites meeting the definition of a redevelopment project and having less than
40% existing impervious surface coverage, the stormwater management
requirements will be the same as other new development projects with the
important distinction that the applicant can meet those requirements either onsite
or at an approved off-site location. The applicant should satisfactorily
demonstrate that impervious area reduction, LID strategies and BMPs have
been implemented on-site.
3. For sites meeting the definition of a redevelopment project and having more
than 40% existing impervious surface coverage, stormwater should be managed
for water quality in accordance with one or more of the following techniques,
listed in order of preference:
a. Implement measures onsite that result in disconnection or treatment of
at least 30% of the existing impervious cover as well as 50% of the
additional proposed impervious surfaces and pavement areas through
the application of filtration media; or
b. Implement other LID techniques onsite to the maximum extent
practicable to provide treatment for at least 50% of the entire site area.
c. Runoff from impervious surfaces shall be treated with BMPs as per the
NH Stormwater Manual or equivalent, AND for Total Nitrogen (TN)
removal, as per MS4 2.3.6 Stormwater Management in New
Development and Redevelopment (Post Construction Stormwater
Management Section a.ii.e)1)b.
ii. Off-Site Mitigation:
1. In cases where the applicant demonstrates, to the satisfaction of the planning
board, that on- site treatment has been implemented or is not feasible, off-site
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 60 of 62
mitigation will be an acceptable alternative if implemented within the same
subwatershed, within the project’s drainage area or within the drainage area of
the receiving water body. To comply with local watershed objectives the
mitigation site would be preferably situated in the same subwatershed as the
development and impact/benefit the same receiving water.
2. Off-site mitigation should be equivalent to no less than the total area of
impervious cover NOT treated on-site.
3. An approved off-site location must be identified, the specific management
measures identified, and an implementation schedule developed in accordance
with planning board review. The applicant must also demonstrate that there is no
downstream drainage or flooding impacts as a result of not providing on-site
management for large storm events.
E. STORMWATER MANAGEMENT PLAN APPROVAL AND RECORDATION
Plan Approval and Review. The Planning Board shall approve the Stormwater
Management Plan if it complies with the requirements of these regulations and other
requirements as provided by law. At the discretion of the Planning Board, a technical
review by a third party may be required of any stormwater management and erosion
control plan prepared under these regulations. The technical review shall be performed
by a qualified professional consultant, as determined by the Planning Board, and the
expense of which shall be the full responsibility of the applicant.
F. OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE CRITERIA
Stormwater management and sediment and erosion control plans shall be incorporated
as part of any approved site plan or subdivision plan. The Notice of Decision shall
reference the requirements for maintenance pursuant to the stormwater management and
erosion and sediment control plans as approved by the Planning Board.
G. POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER INFRASTRUCTURE –
INSPECTION AND RESPONSIBILITY
Municipal staff or their designated agent shall have site access to complete routine
inspections to ensure compliance with the approved stormwater management and
sediment and erosion control plans. Expenses associated with inspections shall be the

The municipality retains the right, though accepts no responsibility, to repair or maintain
stormwater infrastructure if: a property is abandoned or becomes vacant; and in the event a
property owner refuses to repair infrastructure that is damaged or is not functioning properly.
H. DEFINITIONS
a) ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT – Management of resources that is a structured,
iterative process of robust decision making in the face of uncertainty, with an aim
to reducing uncertainty over time via system monitoring. In this way, decision
making simultaneously meets one or more resource management objectives and,
either passively or actively, accrues information needed to improve future
management.
b) BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs) - A structural or non-structural
device designed to temporarily store or treat urban stormwater runoff in order to
mitigate flooding, reduce pollution and provide other amenities.
c) BIORETENTION – A water quality practice that utilizes vegetation and soils to
treat urban stormwater runoff by collecting it in shallow depressions, before
filtering through an engineered bioretention planting soil media.
d) BUFFER – A special type of preserved area along a watercourse or wetland where
development is restricted or prohibited. Buffers protect and physically separate a
resource from development. Buffers also provide stormwater control flood storage
and habitat values. Wherever possible, riparian buffers should be sized to include
the 100- year floodplain as well as steep banks and freshwater wetlands.
e) DISTURBED AREA – An area in which the natural vegetative soil cover has been
removed or altered and, therefore, is susceptible to erosion.
f) ECOSYSTEM SERVICES - The benefits of natural systems to individuals,
communities, and economies. These benefits include provisioning services such as
food and water; regulating services such as flood and disease control; cultural
services such as spiritual, recreational, and cultural benefits; and supporting
services such as nutrient cycling that maintain the conditions for life on Earth.
g) EFFECTIVE IMPERVIOUS COVER (EIC) – The total impervious surface areas
less the area of disconnected impervious cover (areas where runoff is captured and
infiltrated or otherwise treated).
h) ENVIRONMENTAL (NATURAL RESOURCE) PROTECTION - Policies and
procedures aimed at conserving natural resources, preserving the current state of
natural environments and, where possible, reversing degradation. Any activity to
maintain or restore environmental quality through preventing the emission of
pollutants or reducing the presence of polluting substances in environmental
media, and preventing physical removal or degradation of natural resources.
i) FILTRATION – The process of physically or chemically removing pollutants from
runoff. Practices that capture and store stormwater runoff and pass it through a
filtering media such as sand, organic material, or the native soil for pollutant
removal. Stormwater filters are primarily water quality control devices designed to
remove particulate pollutants and, to a lesser degree, bacteria and nutrients.
j) GROUNDWATER RECHARGE – The process by which water that seeps into the ground,
eventually replenishing groundwater aquifers and surface waters such as lakes, streams,
and the oceans. This process helps maintain water flow in streams and wetlands and
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 62 of 62
preserves water table levels that support drinking water supplies.
k) GROUNDWATER RECHARGE VOLUME – The post-development design
recharge volume (i.e., on a storm event basis) required to minimize the loss of
annual pre-development groundwater recharge. The Rev is determined as a
function of annual pre-development recharge for site-specific soils or surficial
materials, average annual rainfall volume, and amount of impervious cover on a
site.
l) IMPAIRED WATERS – Those waterbodies not meeting water quality standards.
Pursuant to Section 303(d) of the federal Clean Water Act, each state prepares a
list of impaired waters (known as the 303(d) list) which is presented in the state's
Integrated Water Report as Category 5 waters. Those impaired waters for which a
TMDL has been approved by US EPA and is not otherwise impaired, are listed in
Category 4A.
m) IMPERVIOUS COVER – Those surfaces that cannot effectively infiltrate rainfall
consisting of surfaces such as building rooftops, pavement, sidewalks, driveways,
compacted gravel (e.g., driveways and parking lots).
n) INFILTRATION – the process of runoff percolating into the ground (subsurface
materials). Stormwater treatment practices designed to capture stormwater runoff
and infiltrate it into the ground over a period of days.
o) LOW IMPACT DEVELOPMENT (LID) - Low impact development is a site
planning and design strategy intended to maintain or replicate predevelopment
hydrology through the use of site planning, source control, and small-scale
practices integrated throughout the site to prevent, infiltrate and manage runoff as
close to its source as possible. Examples of LID strategies are pervious pavement,
rain gardens, green roofs, bioretention basins and swales, filtration trenches, and
other functionally similar BMPs located near the runoff source.
p) MAXIMUM EXTENT PRACTICABLE (MEP) - To show that a proposed
development has met a standard to the maximum extent practicable, the applicant
must demonstrate the following: (1) all reasonable efforts have been made to meet
the standard, (2) a complete evaluation of all possible management measures has
been performed, and (3) if full compliance cannot be achieved, the highest
practicable level of management is being implemented.
q) MITIGATION – Activities, strategies, policies, programs, actions that, over time,
will serve to avoid, minimize, or compensate for (by treating or removing
pollution sources) the impacts to or disruption of water quality and water
resources.
r) MS4 – Refers to the Small Municipal Separate Storm Sewer System General
Permit - the MS4 General Permit - issued by the EPA under the Clean Water Act.
MS4 applies to municipalities that contain any portion of an urbanized area as
defined by the Census. It applies to stormwater conveyances owned by a State,
city, town, or other public entity that discharge to ‘Waters of the United States’.
The MS4 Permit requires that operators of small MS4s develop a Storm Water
Management Program that uses appropriate Best Management Practices (BMPs)
for each of the six minimum control measures required in the MS4 permit.
s) NATIVE VEGETATION AND PLANTINGS - Plants that are indigenous to the
region, adapted to the local soil and rainfall conditions, and require minimal
Stratham, NH Site Plan Review Regulations May 2019
Page 63 of 62
supplemental watering, fertilizer, and pesticide application.
t) POLLUTANT LOAD – means an amount of pollutants that is introduced into a
receiving waterbody measured in units of concentration or mass per time (i.e.
concentration (mg/l) or mass (lbs/day)).
u) REDEVELOPMENT - Any construction, alteration, or improvement that disturbs a
total of 20,000 square feet or more of existing impervious area where the existing
land use is commercial, industrial, institutional, governmental, recreational, or
multifamily residential. Building demolition is included as an activity defined as
“redevelopment”, but building renovation is not. Similarly, removing of roadway
materials down to the erodible soil surface is an activity defined as
“redevelopment,” but simply resurfacing of a roadway surface is not. Pavement
excavation and patching that is incidental to the primary project purpose, such as
replacement of a collapsed storm drain, is not classified as redevelopment. In
general, the requirements in this manual do not apply to projects or portions of
projects when the total existing impervious area disturbed is less than 20,000
square feet. However, specific regulatory programs may impose additional
requirements. Any creation of new impervious area over portions of the site that
are currently pervious is required to comply fully with the requirements of this
manual, with the exception of infill projects.
v) RETENTION – The amount of precipitation on a drainage area that does not
escape as runoff. It can be expressed as the difference between total precipitation
and total runoff from an area.
w) TOTAL SUSPENDED SOLIDS (TSS) – The total amount of soils particulate matter
which is suspended in the water column.
x) WATER QUALITY VOLUME - The storage needed to capture and treat 90% of the
average annual stormwater runoff volume. In Rhode Island, this equates to 1-inch
of runoff from impervious surfaces.
y) WATERSHED – All land and water area from which runoff may run to a common
(design) discharge point.
