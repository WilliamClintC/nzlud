MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY
POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: CIRCULATION POLICY
Purpose: To establish a policy for patron use of Library assets.
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 03-28-2019
Residents and taxpayers of the Newfound Area School District (Alexandria, Bridgewater,
Bristol, Danbury, Groton, Hebron, New Hampton) and Hill are eligible for free library
borrowing privileges so long as they conform to Library policy. Patrons shall be required
to fill out an identification card listing name, address and telephone number. Staff of the
Newfound Regional School District and Jennie D. Blake Elementary School in Hill, and
employees of the Town of Bristol may also receive a library card with borrowing
privileges free of charge under the same provisions. Non-resident patrons shall be required
to pay a $25.00 non-refundable fee.
Borrowers are encouraged to have their Library card or key tag with them in order to
check out Library materials. There is a $3.00 replacement fee for lost cards.
Account holders may fill out a Patron Account Authorized Users Agreement form to allow
friends and family to use their account to check out library items and place holds. Those
listed as authorized users will not have access to the account holder’s circulation history.
The primary account holder is responsible for any and all check outs, damages, lost,
and overdue items on his or her account.
Renewal of library card accounts
Patron accounts will expire after three (3) years from activation date, with the option for renewal.
Borrowing privileges may be limited when an account has expired and has not yet been renewed.
When renewing a library card, a patron will be asked to provide their current address, phone
number, and email address. If the information provided differs from what is currently in the
account, the patron’s electronic record will be updated.
Inactive accounts
In accordance with New Hampshire RSA 33-A:3-a, patron accounts which have not been
used for seven (7) years will be marked inactive. If an account has been marked inactive,
the record and all associated information will be expunged completely from the library’s
system.
6
Library Materials
Books and the ukulele may be kept for 14 days, magazines, movies, and the telescope for 7 days,
and puzzles are loaned out on an honor system. There is a limit of 4 DVDs per Library card. A
book, movie or magazine may be renewed, unless it has been placed on reserve for another
borrower. Renewals may be made once over the phone. Renewals may be made by contacting a
library staff member during normal operating hours or by a patron using his or her online
account.
Patron accounts that have one or more items that are 30 days or more overdue will be
automatically restricted. Items may not be put on hold or checked out to a restricted account.
Once all overdue items are returned, the patron account will once again have full borrowing
privileges. Materials may be returned in the book drop when the Library is not open.
The telescope may only be checked out to Minot-Sleeper Library patrons who are 18 years of
age or older.
• Patrons must sign a Telescope Borrowing Agreement each time the telescope is checked
out.
• The borrower is responsible for all items included with telescope. If any of these items
are damaged or lost, the borrower will pay a replacement fee. Any situation not covered by
this policy will be reviewed and acted upon by the Library Director.
The Minot-Sleeper Library fosters an environment for free use by its patrons. Therefore, there
are no imposed fees for overdue items returned. If a borrower damages library property, they
shall pay the cost of replacement. Once the Library receives the replacement cost of the
material(s), the damaged material(s) becomes the property of the patron and must be picked up
within 30 days. If payment is not made within 30 days since notification was made by the
library, items may be discarded.
Patrons are requested to notify the Library of any changes to phone numbers or addresses so that
Library staff may contact them when material has been reserved.
Overdue Materials:
One week overdue: Patron will receive an automated email
Two weeks overdue: Patron will receive a phone call and/or an automated email
Four weeks overdue: Patron will receive an automated email and his or her account will be
restricted, losing borrowing privileges until item is returned, paid for, or replaced
Six weeks overdue: Patron will receive a letter with the cost of replacement
Claims Returned:
If a Library patron feels that he/she has returned an item and if that item is not on the shelf, then
the user may claim the item returned with no penalty. There is a limit of 3 claims returned per
user, after which Library privileges will be suspended.

MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY
POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: INTER-LIBRARY LOAN POLICY
Purpose: To establish a policy to allow patrons to borrow items from other
participating Libraries via the State of New Hampshire program.
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 3-28-2019
MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY AS THE BORROWER
The Minot-Sleeper Library offers interlibrary loan as one of its core services. In order to satisfy
the needs and interests of local residents, the staff will attempt to borrow specifically-named
materials not available in this Library from other libraries around the state. Interlibrary loans for
unspecified materials on specifically-named subjects also will be submitted.
WHO MAY USE THIS SERVICE: The staff will place interlibrary loan requests for any
cardholder of the Minot-Sleeper Library who is in good standing. The Library reserves the right
to deny interlibrary loan services to any patron with outstanding overdue fines, lost or damaged
item charges, or other infractions on his/her borrower record. Patrons who return interlibrary
loan material(s) past stated due dates or fail to pick up an item after notification two times or
more will be restricted to one interlibrary loan request at a time. Patrons who fail to return an
interlibrary loan item, for which the library must pay to replace, will lose interlibrary loan
borrowing privileges indefinitely.
MATERIALS ELIGIBLE AND INELIGIBLE FOR INTERLIBRARY LOAN REQUESTS:
The Library will request any and all materials, with the following exceptions:
• items that are owned by the Minot-Sleeper Library (the staff may make exceptions for
materials that are temporarily unavailable for reasons such as “missing” or “damaged,” or for
other special situations
• items that are “on order” to be purchased in the Minot-Sleeper Library.
• items classified as “reference” in their home libraries
• items that are local historical and genealogical materials in their home libraries
FEES: The Library will not charge for obtaining items unless the lending institution imposes a
fee. In such cases, local patrons will be contacted and asked for a verbal agreement to pay before
the items are obtained.
REQUEST LIMITS: A patron may have up to four (4) interlibrary loan requests active at the
same time. This limit may be increased under special circumstances, as deemed necessary by
library staff.
9
WAITING TIME: The time required to receive interlibrary loan items can vary between 1 and 2
weeks, although some requests may take shorter or longer times.
PICK-UP: Interlibrary loan materials obtained by the Minot-Sleeper Library are here for a
limited time. Therefore, the patron’s cooperation in picking up materials promptly is requested.
Interlibrary loan materials not picked up within ten (10) days of patron notification may be
returned to the lending institution.
LOAN PERIODS AND RENEWALS: The length of time an interlibrary loan item is available to
this library is determined by the lending institution. Loan periods can vary greatly. Patrons are
warned that some interlibrary loan materials may not be renewable. Renewals of items beyond
the loan period specified by the lending institution must be requested by the Minot-Sleeper
Library and approved in advance by that lending institution.
RETURNS: Patrons who borrow interlibrary loan materials obtained by the Minot-Sleeper
Library must return the items here, not directly to the lending institution. This is for
recordkeeping purposes.
MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY AS THE LENDER
The policy of the Minot-Sleeper Library is to function whenever possible as a provider of
materials in the interlibrary loan system of New Hampshire. As a provider, the Library accepts
Inter-Library Loan requests submitted through other libraries only.
Inter-Library Loan requests may be submitted via the Inter-Library Loan system, paper,
telephone or email.
The Library lends any and all of its print and non-print materials to other libraries through the
interlibrary loan system, with the following exceptions:
• Materials listed as “Reference”
• Circulating materials with one or more holds outstanding
• Magazines
• Newspapers
• Passes to cultural sites
• Books listed on the reading lists of schools serviced by the Minot-Sleeper Library
(summers only)
• Books that are newly acquired less than (6) months old
• DVDs that are newly acquired less than (6) months old
• Unique items including the telescope and ukulele
The following items will be Inter-Library Loaned for one (1) month. Renewals of these items
will be subject to approval by the Library staff. The exception to this rule is if and when the
book is needed by another Library or a book group, the borrowing Library may keep it as long as
needed.
• Books
• Audiobooks
The following items will be interlibrary loaned for three (3) weeks.
• DVDs
10
As a professional courtesy, the Minot-Sleeper Library does not charge fines against
other institutions for overdue items loaned to them through interlibrary loan. However,
it does charge replacement costs for materials lost or damaged while in the care of the
borrowing institutions.
11
MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY
POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: COMPUTER AND INTERNET ACCESS POLICY
Purpose: To establish a policy for use of Library owned computer and for use of the
Wireless Interface available to patrons using their own equipment.
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 3-28-2019
Section One: Computer Use
The Minot-Sleeper Library has six computers available for use by the public. Patrons using these
computers will comply with our Computer Users Agreement. The Library and its Trustees do
not control the internet and cannot guarantee the authenticity of its content. The Library cannot
censor access to material nor protect users from information they find offensive or
controversial. It remains the responsibility of the user to determine what is appropriate. The
Library disclaims any liability or responsibility arising from access to or use of information
obtained through the internet, or any consequences thereof. Parents, not the Library staff, are
responsible for their child's use of the internet at the Library.
• Internet use is limited to one half hour. If no one else is waiting, the user may continue to
use the computer.
• There will be a charge of $ .20 per black/white printed page; $ .40 per colored printed
page.
• Library staff will scan and email a reasonable number of documents for patrons at times
when they are not helping others. These documents will only be emailed to the person for
whom they are being scanned. There is no fee for scanning.
Section Two: Wireless Internet Access
The Library remains a public building and use of patron’s own equipment does not exempt users
from the provisions in the Computer and Internet Access Policy. All patrons use the wireless
internet at their own risk and are cautioned to use good judgment in doing so. Because of the
open nature of the internet there is content that may be deemed inappropriate for viewing in
the Library’s public setting. Patrons are expected to be respectful of their fellow patrons,
including minor library patrons, when using the Library’s wireless networks.
• The Library offers an OPEN, UNSECURED wireless network for public use. The
content on this network is not filtered or otherwise blocked. By using the Library’s
wireless network, the user agrees that the Library has no responsibility for any personal
information that is compromised, or for any damage caused to users’ hardware or
software due to security issues or consequences caused by viruses or hacking. Users are
12
responsible for ensuring that their computer has adequate protection against computer
viruses, spyware, and any and all other malware that their computer may be exposed to
on the Internet or from email attachments, so that it does not infect other devices on the
Library network.
• Library staff may verify whether the Library’s wireless connection is up and running, but
will not be required to assist in making changes to the user’s network settings or perform
any troubleshooting in the user’s computer.
• The Library cannot guarantee uninterrupted wireless service.

MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY
POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: COLLECTION DEVELOPMENT POLICY
Purpose: To establish guidelines for Library collections development
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 3-28-2019
The Minot-Sleeper Library subscribes to the principles of intellectual freedom as stated in the
"Library Bill of Rights" (see Appendix I, a document issued by the American Library
Association). Included in this statement is the commitment to honor the rights of an individual
to use the library regardless of age, race, religion, national origin, or social or political views.
Accordingly, the staff of the library provides equal service to all Library users. Children and
Adults are equally free to use the entire Library and borrow all materials within the circulating
collection.
Ultimate responsibility for selection of Library materials lies with the Board; however the Board
shall delegate to the Director the authority and the responsibility for selection of Library
materials and for the development of the collection. Examples of methods that the Director will
use to select materials for the library are reading professional review materials, e.g., Booklist and
Library Journal, evaluating patron requests, and recommendations from colleagues.
All material chosen for the Minot-Sleeper Library shall be judged individually on the basis of its
merit, subject matter, reader interest, and the need for such a material in a balanced library.
Materials shall be evaluated in total, as a complete work and in the context of all its parts. The
merit of the whole material shall be the basis for choosing the material.
The Library collection covers a general range of subjects; however, there may be moderate
emphasis placed on certain sections to support patron interest. If funds are available, there may
be emphasis on certain curriculum-related materials.
In areas considered controversial, more than one point of view shall be represented by materials
in the Library. These materials may represent points of view sometimes considered unorthodox
or unpopular by the majority.
While collections for adults and children are housed in separate areas, the library staff will not:
• Act in loco parentis (in the place of a parent)
• Censor or label materials in a manner that promotes bias
14
• Restrict access to library materials because of race, religion, gender, age or
socioeconomic status
Parents are the appropriate judges for their own children's library materials, and staff members
encourage those who wish to supervise their children's borrowing to accompany them on library
visits.
In the event that a patron objects to an item or items in the collection, he/she shall be asked to fill
out a "Request for Reconsideration of Materials" form (see appendix). This form will be
reviewed by the Library Board of Trustees and the Library Director at the next monthly meeting
of the Board of Trustees. Consideration shall be made by the Library Director and the Library
Board of Trustees who shall present a written decision to the complainant within six (6) weeks.
The decision may be appealed before the Board of Trustees within thirty (30) days. The Board of
Trustees ultimately decides whether or not controversial materials should be kept, re-cataloged,
or withdrawn from circulation.
Gifts and unsolicited materials may be added to the Library collection. If the materials are not
added to the collection, donors are informed that these materials may be returned to donor, sold
or given to another institution. Upon request, the Library will provide written notice
acknowledging receipt of these materials, but under no circumstances will the Library provide a
value statement, for any purpose, to the donor. (See Donations Policy)
The Library shall use the Continuous Review Evaluation Weeding (CREW) method of weeding
(determining which materials, if any, should be removed from the Library collection at any given
time). Materials may be discarded if such materials do not meet stated goals and are in one or
more of the following categories:
• Misleading, factually inaccurate
• Worn beyond mending or rebinding
• Superseded by a new edition or by a much better book on the subject
• Trivial, of no discernable literary or scientific merit
• Irrelevant to the needs and interests of the library’s community
• Elsewhere, the material is easily obtainable from another library
In choosing to weed any particular materials, the Library Director must take all of these factors
into consideration and must decide the status of each material on an individual basis. The
Director may consult with the N.H. State Library on questionable materials. All discarded
materials shall be sold, donated to appropriate institutions, or destroyed.

MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY
POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: UNATTENDED CHILDREN POLICY
Purpose: To establish a policy to set standards of behavior for children
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 3-28-2019
The Minot-Sleeper Library welcomes children to visit the library and encourages them to read, to
explore various electronic formats, to attend programs and to make full use of the library
resources. Although staff members are committed to the well-being and safety of children using
the Library, our facilities are not designed or licensed to provide childcare. Any public place may
be dangerous for a child who is unattended by a responsible adult or caregiver.
The Library reminds parents to consider the safety and well-being of their children and the needs
of other library users. Children should be supervised at all times and taught and reminded that
the materials in the library must be respected and treated with care. With these considerations in
mind, the following rules apply:
• Children 5 years old and younger must be directly supervised by a responsible adult or
caregiver aged 16 or older in all rooms of the Library, including the Children’s Room.
• Children 10 years old and younger must be accompanied in the Library by a responsible
adult or caregiver aged 16 or older. Children aged 10 or younger may not be left
unattended in the Library for any amount of time. The responsible caregiver must have
contact information for an adult who is legally responsible for the child.
• Parents/guardians are responsible for the behavior of their children in the library, whether
or not the parent or guardian is present.
• At the discretion of the parent/guardian, a child age 11 or older may be left unattended in
the Library for a reasonable period of time needed to select materials, work on a
homework assignment or attend a library program. The child must know how to reach the
parent/guardian or responsible caregiver (aged 16 or older) should a need arise. Children
should not be left for excessively long (more than 2 hours) periods of time.
• When children older than age 11 are visiting the Library by themselves, the adult
responsible for the child will be contacted if the child’s behavior is inappropriate for the
20
Library and guidance from the staff has been ignored. If the adult cannot be reached and
the behavior is deemed dangerous or unacceptably disruptive, the police will be notified.
• Youth younger than 18 must be picked up no later than five minutes before closing time.
Youth left unattended at closing time will have the opportunity to contact an adult. If no
contact can be made, or if a ride has not arrived within 5 minutes of closing, at the
discretion of the Library staff, the police may be called to supervise the child until the
adult arrives. Library employees are not permitted to transport children to another
location.

MINOT-SLEEPER LIBRARY
POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: MEETING ROOM AND BULLETIN BOARD USE
Purpose: To establish procedures for governing the use of public meeting room and
bulletin board spaces in the Library
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 3-28-2019
A. Meeting Space
The Library has a community meeting room available for public use upon application.
Library sponsored meetings will be free and open to the public and are given priority when
scheduling meeting room use. Meetings held within the Library and not sponsored by the
Library are subject to these rules:
1. In accordance with the American Library Association (Article VI) interpretation of the
Library Bill of Rights concerning meeting rooms: Meeting space within the Library is
available to non-profit educational, cultural, civic, intellectual, and charitable organizations.
Meetings in Library space must be free of charge and open to the public. (There may be a
program materials charge) Individual tutoring sessions are not subject to this requirement.
If meeting in libraries supported by public funds are made available to the general public for
non-library sponsored events, the Library may not exclude any group based on the subject
matter to be discussed or based on the ideas that the group advocates. For example, if the
Library allows charities and sports clubs to discuss their activities in library meeting rooms,
then the Library should not exclude partisan political or religious groups from discussing
their activities in the same facilities.
2. Persons meeting in the Library are subject to all rules and regulations of the Library.
Programs may not disrupt normal library business. Attendees will supervise and be
responsible for children inside and outside the library. Youth events will have at least a 1:10
Adult to Child ratio.
3. Profit-making companies or individuals are not allowed to reserve Library space, but such
groups may be contracted by the Library to present a Library-sponsored informational
program. In such cases, the company must offer its information in an educational
presentation. No brand names or company services may be promoted, though a display may
be set up for the duration of the program.
4. The Library recognizes the rights of free speech and free assembly. Granting of permission
to use Library facilities does not constitute an endorsement by the Library staff or Board of
Trustees of the users or their beliefs. No group will imply in its advertising that the Library
has sponsored or supported its meeting or group unless written permission is given by the
Library Director or Board of Trustees.
27
5. Room Reservations:
a. Use of Library space must be requested through a library staff member to ensure that
no two organizations need the space at the same time. Library programs will be
given priority and all other requests will be reviewed on a first come, first served
basis.
b. Notice of cancellation of use of the Library meeting room should be made at least 24
hours in advance.
6. Persons meeting in the Library are responsible for returning furniture, etc. to its original
placement and leaving the space in the condition in which it was found. Any damage done
to the inside or outside of the Library or its contents during or as a result of the meeting will
be assessed to the meeting’s sponsor. Library staff is not responsible for any aspects of
setting up or cleaning up for non-library-sponsored events.
7. Programs held in the Library will be offered free of charge and open to the public; however,
fees may be charged for supplies associated with the event.
8. Groups will meet during regular operating hours unless otherwise approved by the Library
director or Board of Trustees. When a group meets during a time the library is not regularly
open to the public, the presence of a library trustee, employee of the library, a town
employee, or a qualified volunteer of the library is required by insurance. The authorized
individual will coordinate with the Director, designated staff, or trustee to pick up a key if
necessary. Groups will completed the appropriate reservation form and be encouraged to
leave the meeting space at least fifteen (15) minutes before the library closes
9. Occupancy of library space is limited to the Fire Department safety limit of 80 people in the
community meeting room.
B. Displays and Exhibits
The Library is a public forum for ideas and information. Displays and/or exhibits that
support this purpose will be allowed under the following conditions:
1. Either the Library Director or the Board of Trustees may deny a request if the Library’s
space is insufficient or the display is likely to physically hinder the regular operations of
the Library.
2. The Library will not incur any financial responsibility for materials displayed, nor will it
carry insurance to cover theft, loss or damage.
3. No display or exhibit may violate any local, state or federal laws.
4. No organization or individual will be permitted to place in the library any receptacle
which solicits donations unless approved by the Library Director as a project which
supports the library’s mission, goals and/or programs.
5. Granting of permission for displays and/or exhibits in the Library does not constitute an
endorsement by the library staff or Board of Trustees of the display or exhibit or its
content.
C. Bulletin Boards
The Library bulletin boards are meant to be a forum for the dissemination of information to
the public. Some are restricted to Library postings while others display community or nonprofit
information. The library staff will post all submitted announcements regarding official
town board meetings in accordance with state law. All other requests to post material will be
honored under the following conditions:
28

event displayed on the posting.

POLICY AND PROCEDURES
Title: DONATION AND GIFTS POLICY
Purpose: To establish guidelines for the receipt of monetary and property donations
and gifts.
Effective Date: 2-24-2015 Approval Date: 2-24-2015
Approved By: Trustees Reviewed/Revised Date: 3-28-2019
The Minot-Sleeper Library welcomes gifts of money, books, or other property. Gifts help the
Library achieve its mission and enhance our collection and services. The Minot-Sleeper Library
through its Board of Library Trustees may accept or decline any gift offered at its discretion. The
Minot-Sleeper Library also reserves the right to use the gift in whatever manner best serves the
interests of the Library. If accepted, the gift becomes the property of the Minot-Sleeper Library.
All gifts may be utilized, sold or disposed of in the best interest of the Library.
Monetary Contributions:
Monetary contributions are allocated by the Library Board of Trustees to supplement but not
supplant the regular operating budget.
Monetary Endowments:
The Minot-Sleeper Library may accept donations to create an endowment fund with specific
purposes and uses on a case by case basis. The terms of the endowment agreement will be
developed by the donor, Library Director and Library Trustees.
Book Donations - memorial books, used books, other media (cd’s, dvd’s, etc):
Memorial books or other library materials may be donated in honor of a friend or relative, and
are marked with a special bookplate. The continued presence of the book within the collection is
based on the judgment of the Library Director and the use, wear, and appropriateness of the book
will be taken into consideration.
Used books, paperbacks, and other media can often be used in the library's collection. The
Library Director will have final decision as to the disposition of gifted media material. Books
must be in good, clean, odor free condition in order for the Library to accept the donation. We
cannot tell you immediately how your gift will be used as we need to check our holdings, check
the condition of the material, and prepare the items for whatever we decide to do. Generally, the
Library does not accept textbooks or books in poor physical condition.
31
Other Property (i.e. musical instruments, artwork, plants, furniture, etc)
Gifts of other property especially enhance the ability of the Minot-Sleeper Library to offer a
positive experience to our patrons. The decision to accept or decline offers of real property will
be made on a case by case basis by the Board of Trustees, based on recommendations of the
Library Director. The decision to accept the gift (and the continued use of the gift) will be based
on the appropriateness of the gift to a library setting, the potential future cost of maintaining the
gift, physical space constraints of the Library, and other factors particular to the type of gift as
determined by the Board of Trustees.
Disposition of gifts:
In making your gift it is important to understand that the Minot-Sleeper Library reserves the right
to use the gift in whatever way best serves the interest of the Library. The Library applies the
same criteria for evaluating gift items as it applies to purchasing material. Gifts will be
withdrawn in the same manner as purchased material. The Library does not accept responsibility
for notifying donors of withdrawal or replacement of gift items
Tax Implications:
All gifts are tax deductible and the library will furnish a statement for tax purposes, but does not
place a financial value on used items. The Internal Revenue Service will not accept an appraisal
or estimated value of your gift from the recipient institution. This means that the Library cannot
tell you what your gift is worth for the purpose of a tax deduction. The Library is a non-profit
institution. If you intend to take a tax deduction based on your gift, we will give you a receipt for
the number of books donated. We are unable to give you a dollar value for your gift. You should
have an independent party give you the appraisal.

Library Bill of Rights
The American Library Association affirms that all libraries are forums for information and ideas,
and that the following basic policies should guide their services.
I. Books and other library resources should be provided for the interest, information, and
enlightenment of all people of the community the library serves. Materials should not be
excluded because of the origin, background, or views of those contributing to their creation.
II. Libraries should provide materials and information presenting all points of view on current
and historical issues. Materials should not be proscribed or removed because of partisan or
doctrinal disapproval.
III. Libraries should challenge censorship in the fulfillment of their responsibility to provide
information and enlightenment.
IV. Libraries should cooperate with all persons and groups concerned with resisting abridgment
of free expression and free access to ideas.
V. A person’s right to use a library should not be denied or abridged because of origin, age,
background, or views.
VI. Libraries that make exhibit spaces and meeting rooms available to the public they serve

American Library Association
The Freedom to Read Statement
The freedom to read is essential to our democracy. It is continuously under attack. Private groups
and public authorities in various parts of the country are working to remove or limit access to
reading materials, to censor content in schools, to label "controversial" views, to distribute lists
of "objectionable" books or authors, and to purge libraries. These actions apparently rise from a
view that our national tradition of free expression is no longer valid; that censorship and
suppression are needed to counter threats to safety or national security, as well as to avoid the
subversion of politics and the corruption of morals. We, as individuals devoted to reading and as
librarians and publishers responsible for disseminating ideas, wish to assert the public interest in
the preservation of the freedom to read.
Most attempts at suppression rest on a denial of the fundamental premise of democracy: that the
ordinary individual, by exercising critical judgment, will select the good and reject the bad. We
trust Americans to recognize propaganda and misinformation, and to make their own decisions
about what they read and believe. We do not believe they are prepared to sacrifice their heritage
of a free press in order to be "protected" against what others think may be bad for them. We
believe they still favor free enterprise in ideas and expression.
These efforts at suppression are related to a larger pattern of pressures being brought against
education, the press, art and images, films, broadcast media, and the Internet. The problem is not
only one of actual censorship. The shadow of fear cast by these pressures leads, we suspect, to an
even larger voluntary curtailment of expression by those who seek to avoid controversy or
unwelcome scrutiny by government officials.
Such pressure toward conformity is perhaps natural to a time of accelerated change. And yet
suppression is never more dangerous than in such a time of social tension. Freedom has given the
United States the elasticity to endure strain. Freedom keeps open the path of novel and creative
solutions, and enables change to come by choice. Every silencing of a heresy, every enforcement
of an orthodoxy, diminishes the toughness and resilience of our society and leaves it the less able
to deal with controversy and difference.
Now as always in our history, reading is among our greatest freedoms. The freedom to read and
write is almost the only means for making generally available ideas or manners of expression
37
that can initially command only a small audience. The written word is the natural medium for the
new idea and the untried voice from which come the original contributions to social growth. It is
essential to the extended discussion that serious thought requires, and to the accumulation of
knowledge and ideas into organized collections.
We believe that free communication is essential to the preservation of a free society and a
creative culture. We believe that these pressures toward conformity present the danger of
limiting the range and variety of inquiry and expression on which our democracy and our culture
depend. We believe that every American community must jealously guard the freedom to publish
and to circulate, in order to preserve its own freedom to read. We believe that publishers and
librarians have a profound responsibility to give validity to that freedom to read by making it
possible for the readers to choose freely from a variety of offerings.
The freedom to read is guaranteed by the Constitution. Those with faith in free people will stand
firm on these constitutional guarantees of essential rights and will exercise the responsibilities
that accompany these rights.
We therefore affirm these propositions:
1. It is in the public interest for publishers and librarians to make available the widest diversity
of views and expressions, including those that are unorthodox, unpopular, or considered
dangerous by the majority.
Creative thought is by definition new, and what is new is different. The bearer of every new
thought is a rebel until that idea is refined and tested. Totalitarian systems attempt to maintain
themselves in power by the ruthless suppression of any concept that challenges the established
orthodoxy. The power of a democratic system to adapt to change is vastly strengthened by the
freedom of its citizens to choose widely from among conflicting opinions offered freely to them.
To stifle every nonconformist idea at birth would mark the end of the democratic process.
Furthermore, only through the constant activity of weighing and selecting can the democratic
mind attain the strength demanded by times like these. We need to know not only what we
believe but why we believe it.
2. Publishers, librarians, and booksellers do not need to endorse every idea or presentation they
make available. It would conflict with the public interest for them to establish their own political,
moral, or aesthetic views as a standard for determining what should be published or circulated.
38
Publishers and librarians serve the educational process by helping to make available knowledge
and ideas required for the growth of the mind and the increase of learning. They do not foster
education by imposing as mentors the patterns of their own thought. The people should have the
freedom to read and consider a broader range of ideas than those that may be held by any single
librarian or publisher or government or church. It is wrong that what one can read should be
confined to what another thinks proper.
3. It is contrary to the public interest for publishers or librarians to bar access to writings on the
basis of the personal history or political affiliations of the author.
No art or literature can flourish if it is to be measured by the political views or private lives of its
creators. No society of free people can flourish that draws up lists of writers to whom it will not
listen, whatever they may have to say.
4. There is no place in our society for efforts to coerce the taste of others, to confine adults to the
reading matter deemed suitable for adolescents, or to inhibit the efforts of writers to achieve
artistic expression.
To some, much of modern expression is shocking. But is not much of life itself shocking? We
cut off literature at the source if we prevent writers from dealing with the stuff of life. Parents
and teachers have a responsibility to prepare the young to meet the diversity of experiences in
life to which they will be exposed, as they have a responsibility to help them learn to think
critically for themselves. These are affirmative responsibilities, not to be discharged simply by
preventing them from reading works for which they are not yet prepared. In these matters values
differ, and values cannot be legislated; nor can machinery be devised that will suit the demands
of one group without limiting the freedom of others.
5. It is not in the public interest to force a reader to accept the prejudgment of a label
characterizing any expression or its author as subversive or dangerous.
The ideal of labeling presupposes the existence of individuals or groups with wisdom to
determine by authority what is good or bad for others. It presupposes that individuals must be
directed in making up their minds about the ideas they examine. But Americans do not need
others to do their thinking for them.
39
6. It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians, as guardians of the people's freedom to
read, to contest encroachments upon that freedom by individuals or groups seeking to impose
their own standards or tastes upon the community at large; and by the government whenever it
seeks to reduce or deny public access to public information.
It is inevitable in the give and take of the democratic process that the political, the moral, or the
individual or group. In a free society individuals are free to determine for themselves what they
wish to read, and each group is free to determine what it will recommend to its freely associated
members. But no group has the right to take the law into its own hands, and to impose its own
concept of politics or morality upon other members of a democratic society. Freedom is no
freedom if it is accorded only to the accepted and the inoffensive. Further, democratic societies
are more safe, free, and creative when the free flow of public information is not restricted by
governmental prerogative or self-censorship.
7. It is the responsibility of publishers and librarians to give full meaning to the freedom to read
by providing books that enrich the quality and diversity of thought and expression. By the
exercise of this affirmative responsibility, they can demonstrate that the answer to a "bad" book
is a good one, the answer to a "bad" idea is a good one.
The freedom to read is of little consequence when the reader cannot obtain matter fit for that
reader's purpose. What is needed is not only the absence of restraint, but the positive provision of
opportunity for the people to read the best that has been thought and said. Books are the major
channel by which the intellectual inheritance is handed down, and the principal means of its
testing and growth. The defense of the freedom to read requires of all publishers and librarians
the utmost of their faculties, and deserves of all Americans the fullest of their support.
We state these propositions neither lightly nor as easy generalizations. We here stake out a lofty
claim for the value of the written word. We do so because we believe that it is possessed of
enormous variety and usefulness, worthy of cherishing and keeping free. We realize that the
application of these propositions may mean the dissemination of ideas and manners of
expression that are repugnant to many persons. We do not state these propositions in the
comfortable belief that what people read is unimportant. We believe rather that what people read
is deeply important; that ideas can be dangerous; but that the suppression of ideas is fatal to a
democratic society. Freedom itself is a dangerous way of life, but it is ours.

adversely affecting the POTW or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.
35. “Slug” shall mean any discharge of water or wastewater in concentration of any given
constituent or in quantity of flow, exceeding for any period of duration longer than fifteen (15)
minutes more than five (5) times the average twenty-four (24) hour concentration or flows during
normal operation or which shall adversely affect the collection system and/or performance of the
wastewater treatment works.

ARTICLE V
Use of the Public Sewers/Pollutants/Interceptors
1. No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged to the wastewater facilities any
unpolluted waters such as storm water, groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, or noncontact
cooling water.
2. Pollutants introduced into the sanitary sewer by an industrial user shall not cause pass-through
or interference with operation or performance of the POTW.
No person(s) shall discharge or cause to be discharged any of the following described waters or
wastes to any public sewers:
a. Pollutants which create a fire or explosion hazard in the POTW, including, but not
limited to, waste streams with a closed cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit
or 60 degrees Centigrade using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21.
b. Any industrial pollutants, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD, COD etc.), or
chlorine demand requirements released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or concentration
10
which would cause interference with the wastewater treatment works constitute a hazard
to humans or animals, create a public nuisance, exceed any applicable NPCS, or cause
pass through.
c. Any waters or wastes having pH less than 5.0 or greater than 11.0 or having any other
corrosive property capable of causing damage or hazard to structures, equipment, and
personnel of the wastewater works.
d. Solid or viscous substances in quantities or such size capable of causing obstruction to
the flow in sewers, or other interference with the proper operation of the wastewater
facilities such as, but not limited to, ashes, bones, cinders, sand, mud, straw, shavings,
metal, glass, rags, feathers, tar, plastics, wood, unground garbage, whole blood, paunch
manure, hair and fleshing, entrails and paper dishes, cups, milk containers, etc., either
whole or ground by garbage grinders.
e. Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150 F (65 C), or which will inhibit
biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case
wastewater that causes the temperature at the introduction into the POTW treatment plant
to exceed 104 F (40 C).
f. Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of mineral oil origin, in
amounts that will cause interference or pass-through.
g. Pollutants that result in the presence of toxic gases, vapors, or fumes within the POTW in
a quantity that may cause acute worker health and safety problems.
h. Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points designated by the POTW.

3. Screening Levels: The following pollutants shall not be discharged to the POTW exceeding
concentrations listed below without approval of the Superintendent:
Parameter Maximum Concentration (mg/l)__________________
Arsenic 0.167 Lead 0.21
Cadmium 0.075 Mercury 0.04
Chromium 2.1 Nickel 1.49
Copper 2.1 Silver 0.52
Cyanide 0.21 Zinc 0.63
Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated to evaluate, prevent or
reduce adverse impacts due to flammability, chemical reactivity, organic/solids loadings, or
worker health and safety.
If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis must be performed to verify
compliance or noncompliance with that screening level. If noncompliance is confirmed, then the
industrial user may be required, at the discretion of the Superintendent, to conduct an appropriate
engineering evaluation to determine the potential impact of the discharge of this pollutant to the
Bristol’s POTW or alternatively, to develop a pollution prevention plan specifically addressing
the pollutant that exceeds the screening level. This study of plan must be conducted under the
supervision and approval of the Town of Bristol. Should the evaluation indicate the impact to be
unsatisfactory, the Industrial User shall reduce the pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level.
If the evaluation supports development of an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening
level shall be adjusted and administered as a limit for the specific discharge.
4. The following described substances, materials, waters, or waste shall be limited in discharges
to municipal systems to concentrations or quantities which will not harm either the sewers,
wastewater treatment process or equipment, will not have an adverse effect on the receiving
11
stream, will not otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance, will not
interfere with safety, O&M, and performance, or will not prevent beneficial use of sludge as
defined in Env-Ws 802.05 The Superintendent may set limitations lower than the limitations
established in the regulations below if, in his opinion, such limitations are necessary to meet the
above objectives. In forming his opinion as to the acceptability, the Superintendent will give
consideration to such factors as the quantity of subject waste in relation to flows and velocities in
the sewers, materials of construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed,
capacity of the wastewater treatment plant, degree of treat ability of the waste in the wastewater
treatment plant, and other pertinent factors. The Superintendent shall not permit those discharges
which are prohibited by number 2 of this Article. The limitations of restrictions on materials or
characteristics of waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer which shall not be
violated without approval of the Superintendent are as follows:
A. Wastewater containing more than 25 milligrams per liter of petroleum oil, non-biodegradable
(chlorine free) cutting oils, or product of mineral oil origin.
B. Wastewater containing more than 100 milligrams per liter of oil and grease or floatable oil
not limited by paragraph A of this Section.
C. Any garbage that has not been properly shredded (see Article I, #23). Garbage grinders may

catering establishments, or similar places where garbage originates from the preparation of
food in kitchens for the purpose of consumption on the premises or when served by caterers.
D. Any waters or wastes containing heavy metals, solvents, and similar objectionable toxic
substances to such degree that any such material discharged to the public sewer exceeds the
limits established by the Superintendent, the DES, or the NCPS, as promulgated by the
U.S.E.P.A., for such materials.
E. Any waters or wastes containing odor-producing substances exceeding limits which may be
established by the Superintendent.
F. Any radioactive wastes or isotopes of such half-life or concentration as may exceed limits
established by the Superintendent in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations.
G. Quantities of flow, concentrations, or both which constitute a “slug”, as defined herein.
H. Waters or wastes containing substances which are not amenable to treatment or reduction by
the wastewater treatment processes employed, or are amenable to treatment only to such
degree that the wastewater treatment plant effluent cannot meet the permitted discharge.
I. Any water or wastes which, by interaction with other water or wastes in the public sewer
system, release obnoxious gases, form suspended solids which interfere with the collection
system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment processes.
5. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers
and these waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in 3 of this
Article, and which in the judgment of the Superintendent may have a deleterious effect upon the
wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or which otherwise create a
hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the Superintendent may, subject to limitations in
numbers 2 and 10 of this Article,
A. Reject the wastes,
B. Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers,
C. Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and or/
D. Require payment to cover added cost of handling and treating the wastes.
If the BSD permits the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the design and installation of
the pretreatment facilities shall be subject to the review and approval of the BSD and the DES,
and subject to the requirements of all applicable codes, ordinances and laws. Such facilities shall
not be connected to the sanitary sewer until said approval is obtained in writing. Such approval
12
shall not relieve the owner of the responsibility of discharging treated waste, meeting the
requirements of this ordinance. Plans and specifications for a proposed pretreatment facility shall
be the result of the design of a professional engineer registered in New Hampshire.
6. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the Superintendent,
they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable oil or grease in
excessive amounts, as specified in #4 (b), or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful
ingredients, except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or
dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Superintendent,
and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and monthly inspection. In
the maintaining of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible for the proper removal and
disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates,
and means of disposal which are subject to review by the Superintendent. Any removal and
hauling of the collected materials not performed by the owner(s) personnel must be performed by
currently licensed waste disposal firms.
7. All industrial waste shall be pretreated in accordance with federal and state regulations and
this ordinance to the extent required by applicable NCPS, state pretreatment standards or
standards established by the Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. Where pretreatment of
flow-equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters or wastes, they shall be
maintained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner(s) at his expense.
8. When required by the Superintendent, the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer
carrying industrial wastes shall install a suitable control structure together with such necessary
meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observations, sampling, and
measurements of the wastes. Such structure, when required, shall be accessible and safely
located and shall be constructed in accordance with plans approved by the Superintendent. The
structure shall be installed by the owner at his expense, and shall be maintained by him so as to be
safe and accessible at all times. All industrial users shall perform such monitoring as the BSD or
duly authorized employees of the BSD may reasonably require, including installation, use of
maintenance of monitoring equipment, keeping records and reporting the results of such
monitoring to the department. Such records shall be made available upon request by the
department, to other agencies having jurisdiction over discharges to the receiving waters.
9. The Superintendent may require a user of sewer services to provide information needed to
determine compliance with the ordinance. These requirements may include:
A. Wastewater discharge peak rates and volume over a specified time period.

reference is made in this ordinance shall be determined in accordance with EPA approved
methods published in the Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 136 (40 CFR 136) or, if
none are available, then with methods specified in the latest edition of “Standard Methods for the
Examination of Water and Wastewater”, published by the American Public Health Association.
13
Sampling methods, locations, times, duration’s, and frequencies are to be determined on an
individual basis subject to approval by the Superintendent.
11. No statement contained in this Article, except for # 4, shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the BSD and any industrial user whereby an industrial
waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the BSD for treatment, provided that
such agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing Federal or State laws, and/or
regulations promulgated there under, are compatible with any User Charge System in effect, and
do not waive applicable NCPS.
12. As provided by New Hampshire Revised Statute annotated 486:13, municipalities need not
accept septage at a POTW, if said septage would interfere with the proper operation of the
POTW. Due to the type of treatment process provided, the BSD will not accept septage.
13. It shall be illegal to meet requirements of this Sewer Ordinance by diluting wastes in lieu of
proper pretreatment.
14. Each industrial user shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other substances regulated by this ordinance. Facilities to prevent accidental
discharges shall be provided and maintained at the industrial user’s expense.
15. Bypass is prohibited except where the bypass is unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal
injury, or severe property damage. The industrial user shall notify the Superintendent
immediately in the event of any bypass.
16. A notice shall be permanently posted plainly visible to an industrial user’s personnel
responsible for managing wastewater discharges, which shall instruct all employees who to call in
the event of a spill, slug discharge, pretreatment upset or bypass. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a discharge to occur know of the required notification of
the Superintendent.
17. If sampling performed by an industrial user indicates a violation, the user shall notify the
BSD within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The User shall also repeat the sampling
and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the BSD within 30 days after
becoming aware of the violation, except that the Industrial User is not required to resample if:
A. The BSD performs sampling at the Industrial User at a frequency of at least once per month,
or
B. The BSD performs sampling at the Industrial User between the time when the User performs
its initial sampling and the time when the user receives the results of this sampling.

7. In those instances in which the industrial user provides notification of the discharge of
hazardous waste, the industrial user shall also provide the following certification: I certify
that (the company) has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous
wastes generated to the degree (the company) has determined to be economically practical.
8. Information showing the measured averaged daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per
day, to the public sewer from regulated process streams and from other streams.
9. A schedule of actions to be taken to comply with discharge limitations.
10. Additional information as determined by the BSD may also be required.
11. Any other information which may be needed to meet the baseline monitoring requirements
applicable to industrial users subject to NCPS.
C. Provisions - IDP will outline the general and specific conditions under which the industrial
waste is accepted for treatment at the Town of Bristol’s wastewater treatment plant.
Specifically included in the agreement are the following:

indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge from the regulated
processes governed by pretreatment standards and the average and maximum daily flow of
these process units. The report shall state whether the applicable categorical pretreatment
standards and effluent limitation are being met on a consistent basis and, if not, what
additional operation and maintenance practices and/or pretreatment are necessary. Additional
requirements for such reports by be imposed by the BSD
b. Of an individual user subject to the reporting requirements in the previous paragraph of this
section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the BSD, using procedures
prescribed in Article V, #10, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report.
D. Dilution – No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute
a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with
a discharge limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or
requirement. The Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to
meet applicable pretreatment standard or requirement or in other cases when the imposition of
mass limitations is appropriate.
3. Monitoring Records
15
A. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements under this section shall maintain records
of information resulting from monitoring activities required to prepare such reports. The
Inspector may require the user to install monitoring and sampling equipment as necessary.
B. Industrial users subject to the reporting requirements of this Ordinance shall retain, and make
available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any
monitoring activities required by this Ordinance and any additional records of information
obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements. Records shall include the date, exact location, method, and time of sampling,
and the name of the person(s) obtaining the samples; the dated analyses were performed; who
performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such
analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least five (5) years. This
period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user
of the BSD, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by
the Superintendent. Before destroying the records, the industrial user shall request and
receive permission from the BSD.
C. The Inspector is authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes that have a
bearing on the kind of source of discharge to the public sewer. The industrial user may
request that the information in question not be disclosed to the public in accordance with
Section 8 of this Ordinance. The information in question shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Ordinance, the NPDES
permit, or the pretreatment program. The burden of proof that information should be held
confidential rests with the user. However, information regarding wastewater discharge by the
user (flow, constituents, concentrations, and characteristics) shall be available to the public
without restriction.
4. Additional Conditions:
A. The permit will be in effect for one year and will be automatically renewed for one year
periods by issuance on the anniversary or revised cover page or complete IDP, unless the
applicant is notified otherwise by the BSD. At a minimum, a review will be performed at
least once every five years.
B. The permit is non-transferable, and may be revoked by the BSD for non-compliance, or
modified so as to conform to discharge limitation requirements that are enacted by Federal or
State Rules and/or Regulations.
C. An industry proposing a new discharge or a change in volume or composition of its existing
discharge must submit a completed IDP application with the required State filing fee to the
BSD at least 60 days prior to the commencement of such discharge. The submitted
application must include plans and engineering drawings, stamped by a professional engineer
registered in New Hampshire, of the proposed pretreatment facilities. Upon approval of the
application by the BSD, a Discharge Permit Request is submitted by the community to the
DES on behalf of the industry. Upon approval of the Discharge Permit Request by the DES,
the industry and the BSD will enter into a new or amended IDP in accordance with the
procedure outlined in this subpart.
D. Industrial users will be assessed a semi-annual fee by the BSD to defray the administrative
and monitoring costs of the IDP program.
E. The BSD has the authority to assess an additional charge to commercial and industrial users
that discharge a higher strength waste relative to average wastewater characteristics. This
additional assessment shall be based upon standard User Charge System complying with EPA
standards.
F. Signature for Reports - the reports required by Article VI #2-B and signed as follows:
16
1. By a responsible corporate officer, if the Industrial user submitting the reports required by
this Ordinance is a corporation. For the purpose of this paragraph, a responsible corporate
officer means:
a) a president, manager, treasurer, or vice-president of the corporation in charge of a
principal business function, or any other person who performs similar policy or decisionmaking
functions for the corporation or
b) the manager of one or more manufacturing, production, or operations facilities.
2. By a general partner or proprietor if the Industrial User submitting the reports required by this

position of plant manager, or a position of equivalent responsibility, or having overall
responsibility for environmental matters for the company; and
c. the written authorization is submitted to the BSD.
4. If an authorization under paragraph 3 of this subsection is no longer accurate because a
different individual or position has responsibility for the overall operation of the facility, or
overall responsibility for environmental matters for the company, a new authorization
satisfying the requirements of paragraph 3 of this subsection must be submitted to the BSD
prior to or together with any reports to be signed by an authorized representative.
G. Certification- All reports required to be signed as specified in #4-F Signature for Reports
shall include the following certification: “I certify under penalty of law that this document
and all attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a
system designed to ensure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the

submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am
aware that there are significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”
5. National Categorical Pretreatment Standards:
A. Notification-The BSD shall provide timely notification to appropriate industries of applicable
categorical pretreatment standards.
B. Compliance Date for Categorical Standards-Compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards shall be achieved within three (3) years of the date such standards are effective,
unless a shorter compliance time is specified in the standards.
C. Amendment to IDP Required-An industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards
shall not discharge wastewater directly or indirectly to Town of Bristol Wastewater Facilities
after the compliance date of such standards unless an Amendment to its IDP has been issued
by the BSD.
D. Application for IDP Amendment-Within 120 days after the effective date of a categorical
pretreatment standard, an industry subject to such standards shall submit an application for an
IDP Amendment. The application shall contain the information noted under #2B of this
Article.
17
E. Categorical Compliance Schedule Reports-Each user subject to a compliance schedule as
required under Article VI, #2, B& 7 or federal regulation 40 CFR 403.12 b, 7 shall report on
progress toward meeting compliance with these regulations as follows:
1. Not later than 14 days following each date in the schedule, and the final date for compliance,
the industrial user shall submit a progress report to the BOS indicating whether or not it
completed with the increment of progress to be met on such date and, if not, the date on
which it expects to comply, the reason for the delay, and the steps being taken by the
industrial user to return the progress to the schedule established.
2. The time for any increment in the schedule, or the interval between reports required in
paragraph 1, shall not exceed 9 months. An increment is the time between the dates for
commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of
pretreatment facilities necessary to achieve compliance with this ordinance and national
categorical pretreatment standards.
F. Report on Compliance with Categorical Standard Deadline-Within 90 days following the date
for final compliance with the applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a
new industrial user following introduction of wastewater into town sewer, any industrial user
subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the BSD a report
indicating the nature and concentration of all pollutants in the discharge that are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for
the reporting period. The report shall state whether the applicable pretreatment standards are
being met on a consistent basis, and if, not, what additional operation and maintenance and/or
pretreatment is necessary to bring the industrial user into compliance with the applicable
pretreatment standards. This statement shall be signed by an authorized representative (see
Article VI,#4, F) and certified by a qualified professional engineer.
G. All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s discharge. Wastewater
monitoring and flow measurements facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and
maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to maintain its
monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that
sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge.
6. Slug Discharge Notification - All industrial users shall notify the Superintendent immediately
of all discharges which could cause problems to the wastewater treatment facilities, including any
slug loadings as defined in Article I, #35. Within five days of the un-allowed discharge, the
industrial user shall provide the Superintendent with a written report fully describing the unallowed
discharge, the pollutants involved, the cause of the unusual discharge and the measures
taken and to be taken to avoid recurrence of the un-allowed discharge.
7. Imminent Endangerment - The BSD may, after informal notice to the industrial user
discharging wastewater to the public sewer, immediately halt or prevent any such discharge
reasonably appearing to present an imminent endangerment to the health and welfare of person,
or any discharge presenting, or which may present an endangerment to the environment, or which
threatens to interfere with operation of the public sewer or wastewater treatment facilities.
Actions which may be taken by the BSD in response to violations of this ordinance include ex
parte judicial injunctive relief, entry on private property to halt such discharge, blockage of a
public sewer to halt such discharge, or demand of specific action by the industry.
8. Monitoring and Surveillance - The BSD shall as necessary sample and analyze the
wastewater discharges of contributing industrial users and conduct surveillance and inspection
activities to identify, independently of information supplied by such industrial users, occasional
18
and continuing non-compliance with industrial pretreatment standards. Each industrial user will
be billed directly for costs incurred for analysis of its wastewater. All industrial users shall allow
unrestricted access by the BSD, DES and EPA personnel for the purposes of investigating and
sampling discharges from the industries. The Inspector(s) may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary.
9. Investigations - The BSD shall investigate instances of non-compliance with industrial
pretreatment standards and requirements.
10. Public Information - The Inspectors(s) is authorized to obtain information concerning
industrial processes that have a bearing on the kind or source of discharge to the public sewer.
The industrial user may request that the information in question not be disclosed to the public in
accordance with 40 CFR Part 25. The information in question shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Ordinance, the NPDES permit, or
the pretreatment program. The burden of proof that information should be held confidential rests
with the user. However, information regarding wastewater discharge by the user (flow,
constituents, concentrations, and characteristics) shall be available to the public without
restriction.
11. Public Participation - The BSD shall comply with the public participation requirements of
40 CFR Part 25 in the enforcement of industrial pretreatment standards and requirements. A list
of significant violators shall be published in the local paper at least annually.
ARTICLE VII

pertinent to discharge to the wastewater facilities, in accordance with the provisions of this
ordinance.
2. The Superintendent or other duly authorized employees are authorized to obtain information
concerning industrial processes which have a bearing on the kind and source of discharge to the
public sewer. The Industrial User may request that the information in question not be made
available to the public if it can establish that revelation to the public might result in an advantage
to competitors. The information in question shall be made available upon written request to
governmental agencies. The burden of proof that information should be held confidential rests
with the Industrial User. However, information about wastewater discharged by the Industrial
User (flow, constituents, concentration, characteristics and similar information) shall be available
to the public without restriction.
3. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in Article VII, # 1
above, the Superintendent or duly authorized employees of the BSD shall observe all safety rules
applicable to the premises, established by the company. The company shall be held harmless for

ARTICLE X
COMBINING DEPARTMENTS
The following regulation is to be incorporated into The Rules and Regulations of the Bristol
Board of Selectmen after having been duly read and public comment heard at a Public Hearing of
the Bristol Sewer Commission on Thursday, May 31, 1990 at 7:30 PM in The Bristol Town
Office Building. Formal adoption of this regulation shall take place at the next regularly
scheduled meeting of the Bristol Sewer Commission by voice vote at 7:00 PM on June 14, 1990.
To Wit:
It shall be a regulation of the Bristol Sewer Commission that, effective the second fiscal quarter
1990 of the Bristol Sewer Department, and pursuant to RSA 149-I: 8, charges for sewer service
shall be combined with charges for water service to form one joint billing issued by both the
Bristol Water Works and the Bristol Sewer Department (Bristol Sewer Department). The
combined total of charges for water and sewer services must be paid in its entirety within thirty
(30) days of issuance or the entire bill will be considered delinquent.
In the event that a combined bill for water and sewer services shall become delinquent, the
following procedures shall apply:
A. On the thirty-first (31st) day after mailing of quarterly bills, if payment has not been received,
a “Late Notice” shall be sent to the customer, addressed to them at the address on file at the
21
offices of the Bristol Sewer Department, advising of delinquency and impending shut-off of
water service if unpaid after ten (10) days.
B. If, ten (10) days after mailing of said “Late Notice”, the bill remains unpaid; a door knocker
will be placed on a door of the residence giving them one (1) more day in which to pay their
bill. If it is not paid at that time, water service may be terminated without further notice.
C. Water service terminated due to non-payment of user charges shall not be re-established until
all charges, including late fees and reconnection fees, have been paid at the office of Sewer
Department.
D. Charges for re-establishment of water service due to non-payment shall be $45.00.
E. The Bristol Sewer Department shall bear no responsibility for damages caused to household
plumbing, heat plant or fixtures when water service has been terminated due to non-payment
of user fees.
F. As charges for water and sewer usage are a regular and quarterly issued bill for services, nonreceipt
of said bills for services does not constitute a legitimate reason for non-payment of
those charges.
ARTICLE XI
VALIDITY
1. All ordinances or parts of ordinances in conflicts herewith are hereby repealed.
2. The invalidity of any section, clause, sentence, or provision of this ordinance shall not affect

duly held session of the said Superintendent and Selectmen.
Bristol, New Hampshire
By: Board of Selectmen

Town of Bristol, New Hampshire
Winter and Inclement Weather Policy and Priorities
Pursuant to RSA 231:92-a, the Bristol Board of Selectmen hereby establishes the following policy and procedure for winter and
inclement weather road maintenance.
Part A: Policy Objectives.
1. Objective. The Town of Bristol seeks to provide timely, efficient and cost-effective winter maintenance,
snow removal, and ice control on the Town’s public highways, bridges and sidewalks, for the safety and benefit of the
Town's residents and the general motoring and pedestrian public.
2. Procedure. The objective stated in Section 1 may best be achieved by implementation and execution of
the procedures and tasks outlined in Part B of this Policy, the Town’s Winter Operations Snow Removal and Ice Control
Procedures. Due to the many variables that are inherent in New England weather, each storm or weather event may
require slightly different effort or emphasis on any number of maintenance tasks which, together, determine the overall
winter maintenance, snow removal or ice control strategy.
3. Level of Service. It is not reasonably possible to maintain a snow- and ice-free road or sidewalk
during a storm. The Town intends to utilize its best efforts, within the means available, to provide practical, safe access
to homes, businesses, and municipal and other public facilities during and after winter storms.
(A) As a general policy, the Town will start to conduct snow removal operations upon accumulations of 2 inches
of snowfall. The Road Agent may, at his or her discretion, based upon weather information reports or prevailing
conditions, elect to not remove snow until greater or lesser amounts have accumulated.
(B) Notwithstanding any other provision of this policy, snow removal or road or sidewalk treatment operations
may be suspended at any time when continuing operations would pose a hazard to persons or property.
(C) Pre-treatment and ice control may be implemented prior to, during, or after a storm, as determined to be
most effective, noting that salt has a much slower effect on melting snow and ice at temperatures below 25 degrees
Fahrenheit, and thus may not be applied until it is warmer.
(D) Sidewalk snow clearance will be conducted as soon as possible during winter storms, subject to availability
of personnel, and the need to maintain safe roadways will generally take priority. Property owners may assist the Town
in sidewalk safety by clearing snow from sidewalks in front of their properties, provided that the snow so removed is not
placed in the streets.
4. Direction. The Bristol Road Agent, or the Road Agent’s designee, shall direct all winter maintenance
activities for the Town.
5. Implementation. This policy, including the standard operating procedures set forth in Part B, is
intended to serve as the normal procedure for winter maintenance, snow removal, and ice control for the Town of Bristol.
One or more of the following events or circumstances, which may delay or prevent the implementation of this policy,
may affect all or any part of normal operating procedures:
• Equipment Breakdown
• Snow Accumulation in Excess of One Inch per Hour
• Freezing Rain or Other Icing Conditions
• Traffic Congestion
• Emergencies
• Personnel Illness
• Other Events beyond the Reasonable Control of the Town
6. Notice. This policy may be posted in appropriate public places in the Town as determined by the
Selectmen. All residents are encouraged to familiarize themselves with the contents hereof as it describes conditions that
one might expect to encounter before, during and after a winter storm event.
7. Adoption. This policy and the accompanying Part B, encompassing standard operating procedures, have
been adopted by the Bristol Board of Selectmen on __________, 2005.
Part B:
Town of Bristol, N.H.
WINTER OPERATIONS
STANDARD SNOW REMOVAL AND ICE CONTROL PROCEDURES
(Includes Public Highways, Bridges, Sidewalks, and Parking Areas)
1. EQUIPMENT and PERSONNEL: The assets available for winter snow removal and ice control are established
within the parameters of the annual budget approved by the Town. In formulating the budget, the Town seeks to allocate
sufficient funds for this purpose, but variable weather conditions may make budget projections inaccurate. When weather
conditions require additional funds beyond those available in the budget, the Town will undertake such actions as are
reasonably necessary to address such conditions, but the Town is bound by law to follow certain legal requirements and
procedures that may delay the immediate availability of funds for responses. The Highway Department utilizes available
assets of the Department as needed to address snow emergencies. The Town of Bristol has 5 full-time personnel available
for winter maintenance operations [and contracts with independent plowing services for additional plowing as
appropriate.]
2. ROUTES: Currently, the Town is divided into 4 major plow and/or treatment routes as specified in Appendix A. The
Town’s available equipment is assigned to a plow route as stated in Appendix A.
The Town uses a backhoe to load trucks during winter operations. This backhoe is also used to load snow or push
back snow at intersections to create better lines of sight.
Plow routes may be altered from time to time for more efficient snow removal or cost efficiencies. The Road
Agent shall notify the Town Administrator and relevant personnel of such changes. Limited, temporary changes made in
accordance with this section do not require approval of the Town Administrator or Board of Selectmen, unless specifically
advised to the contrary.
-2-
3. MATERIALS: The Town bases its annual budget for snow removal materials in part on past usage and estimated
weather forecasts. In recent years, the Department has used approximately 500 tons of rock salt (or other de-icing agent)
and 2000 cubic yards of sand each season. The sand is used as an abrasive and is applied to the road to improve traction
for motor vehicles. Salt is employed as de-icing and anti-icing agent. The estimated annual supply of sand is purchased
each year, mixed with salt and stockpiled inside the Highway Department's storage building. Rock salt is purchased as
needed, with a limited quantity of approximately 60 tons stockpiled by the Highway Department. Unless weather
conditions require a different approach, winter maintenance routes are treated with a mixture of sand and salt, generally
with a minimum amount of salt to prevent freezing of the mixture. The mixture may be adjusted according to the nature
of the storm with additional salt if needed. The mixture is applied to the traveled way. At the beginning and at the
conclusion of a storm, salt may also be applied to the center of paved roads where traffic traveling in either direction can
work the material. The salt in conjunction with traffic action creates a solution intended to assist in melting snow and ice,
and resisting snow and ice packing on the roadway. The road crown further assists with the spreading of the mixture.
The sand/salt mixture, as well as salt itself, is effective only to approximately 25 degrees Fahrenheit. Other de-icing
agents may be effective to lower temperatures, but cost and need for specialized equipment have forestalled their use at
this time.
4. COMMUNICATIONS: The majority of the Public Works rolling stock is equipped with VHF band radios. Each
plow and equipment operator is assigned a unique call number. Radios are also maintained at the Highway Department
garage, and each operator may communicate with the Town Police and Fire Departments.
5. SCHOOLS:
(A) The Town is not responsible for clearing of snow and winter treatment of the School parking lot. On days
when school is in session, winter road maintenance efforts are timed to coincide with bus routing and delivery of students
to the extent reasonably practicable.
(B) School Cancellation. The School Superintendent, or designated official representative, may contact the Road
Agent or Highway Department’s designee to determine the condition of the municipality's roads in order to determine the
advisability of students using school buses. The school representative(s) shall make the decision to cancel or postpone
school for that day.
6. PARKING: The Town has adopted winter parking regulations. One purpose of this winter parking ban is to allow
winter maintenance crews unobstructed snow removal and ice control routes, as much as possible, to maintain the
maximum effectiveness of their efforts.
7. PLOW ROUTE PRIORITIES: With a total of approximately 35 miles of roads from which to remove snow and
control ice, and having available only the equipment specified in Appendix B to handle this activity, the Highway
Department has to assign priorities for winter maintenance route activity in order to maximize the effectiveness of its
efforts in accordance with the following:
A. School Bus Routes. School bus routes are given first priority on school days. Plow routes are designed with the
intent to provide snow clearing with one hour of the regular school bus schedule for that route.
B. Public Parking Areas. The public parking area at the Town Office will be plowed and skid resistant material
will be applied as needed.
C. Fire Department. The Fire Station property will be plowed and skid resistant material will be applied as
needed.
D. Transfer Station/Recycling Center. Transfer station personnel may be required to assist with the Town’s general
winter maintenance operations. If the facility is open during a storm/winter event, the Highway Department will plow the
-3-
facility as part of a plow route. If the facility is not open, it will be plowed as conditions and available resources warrant.
Transfer station attendants will attempt to keep public areas reasonably clear of snow and ice, and maintain them with
sand and other slip resistant materials, recognizing that it will often not be possible to maintain grounds free and clear of
ice and snow.
E. Specific plow routes for the Town are listed in Appendix A; however, the routes, their priority and the timing of
activities are all subject to variation or not being following or implemented as conditions warrant.
8. ROADS AND SIDEWALKS NOT RECEIVING WINTER MAINTENANCE: The Town of Bristol does not
maintain a number of roadways, sidewalks and other areas as part of its winter maintenance activities. The areas not
maintained by the Town include:
(A) Class VI roads.
(B) Private roads, driveways, and sidewalks.
(C) Roads, sidewalks and other areas maintained or within the jurisdiction of State, Federal or other units of
government
-4-
9. DAMAGE TO PRIVATE PROPERTY: The descriptions of immunity and potential liability in this section are not
intended to waive any immunity or to extend any liability that may exist under law; but are intended solely for
convenience.
(A) The Town of Bristol assumes no responsibility for damage to private property that is located within the public
right-of-way as such property is deemed an encumbrance that is not permitted to be located in the right-of-way. The
right-of-way is often 50' wide, and land within the right-of-way may be mistaken by property owners as their own
property. In many cases, the right-of-way may extend 10' to 20' either side of the paved or graveled surface of a road.
Homeowners sometimes may extend lawns, plant trees or shrubbery, place mailboxes, or erect fences or stonewalls in
these areas, which might be intended to improve appearance, but which may obstruct or interfere with maintenance being
conducted on the roadway, including winter maintenance.
(B) In the event of property damage occurring as a result of winter maintenance activities conducted by the Town
of Bristol, the Town may be held responsible only for damages as allowed by law arising from negligence or other fault
properly attributable to the Town. In any event, the Town will not be responsible for the repair or replacement of
damaged property that is within the public right-of-way, whether located on private or public property, or which is the
result of negligence or fault attributable to others.
(C) The Town will also not be responsible for damage to any vehicle which may be damaged during winter
maintenance if the vehicle is parked in violation of any State law or local regulation, including any winter or snow
removal parking limitation periods, or is otherwise improperly or imprudently located or operated.
10. PLACEMENT OF SNOW IN RIGHT-OF-WAY. No snow is to be shoveled, blown, plowed or placed, by any
means, onto Town streets or sidewalks or across roadways to the opposite side snow banks, unless it is immediately
cleaned up and removed so as to eliminate any hazard or danger to the public or to Town vehicles.
11. ROADWAY OBSTRUCTIONS: If any pedestrian or vehicle or other item interferes with snow removal
operations, the Town’s personnel will seek the cooperation of the person or the owner of such item to remove it
immediately. If the owner cannot be readily located or if the owner refuses to cooperate, the Town vehicle operator shall
contact the Town Police Department for assistance. Operators should not attempt to confront owners with regard to such
matters.
12. POST STORM OPERATIONS: As determined by the Road Agent, snow banks resulting from previous
accumulations may be pushed back, or shelved, using the plow and wing of suitable equipment to make space for future
snow storms.
13. SNOW REMOVAL FROM TOWN ROADS: During the initial stages of a storm, Town highways will be plowed
and receive surface treatment as appropriate in accordance herewith. As parked vehicles are removed from streets, snow
removal equipment may swing wider through the street to push back accumulated snow.
(A) Any vehicles which violate winter parking regulations are subject to ticketing and towing. Any vehicle which
otherwise interferes with the reasonable efforts of the Town’s winter maintenance is subject to removal, after reasonable
attempt to notify the operator, if possible.
(B) Snow removal operations may be delayed or ended in areas where vehicles are improperly parked or where
they might interfere with snow removal operations.
(C) The Town is not responsible for damages to such vehicles arising out of winter maintenance operations or as a
result of towing.
14. SIDEWALK SNOW REMOVAL:
(A) Sidewalk snow clearance generally will not begin until all other street snow removal operations are in progress.
-5-
(B) If sufficient personnel are not available to conduct sidewalk snow removal operations, as well as street
clearance, the streets shall take priority.
-6-

5. Municipal Road and Sidewalk Liability
Avoiding or Lessening Liability Through Preventive Policies
[Note: The adoption of a policy such as this may demonstrate that the municipality is undertaking reasonable preventive
practices. Even if a policy is not adopted, it is recommended that a municipality undertake actions as suggested in this sample
policy. A policy is preferred as this may invoke “discretionary immunity” as discussed in the presentation.]
As part of the obligations of the Municipality of to carry out its responsibilities and duties of maintaining
class V (and IV) roads and public sidewalks in accordance with RSA 231:90 - 231:93, the (Council/Board of
Selectmen/Manager/Board of Commissioners) adopts these policies:
1. Purpose and Intent. In 1991, the New Hampshire Legislature enacted laws to more clearly specify the
conditions under which a municipality may be held liable for insufficiencies in highways and sidewalks which the
municipality is required to maintain. The purpose of this policy is to adopt and implement procedures to comply with
those statutory changes and to carry out the ______________'s obligations in a reasonable and meaningful way within the
limits of available resources.
2. General standards. The ________ will make reasonable attempts to keep all its class V (and IV) roads and
public sidewalks free from insufficiencies as defined by RSA 231:90, II. Because of the nature of the municipality and
the (insert exact number of) miles of maintained roads and sidewalks which it contains, the ________ cannot practically
assure that all roads and sidewalks will be safe and free from defects of all kinds. Many roads are "rural" roads that are
often unpaved and "rough." [Describe sidewalks, if appropriate]. While the __________ will make reasonable efforts to
assure that roads are safely passable by normal passenger vehicles traveling at safe speeds under existing conditions, and
that its sidewalks may safely be used by prudent pedestrians, the _________ expects that operators of motor vehicles and
pedestrians will exercise due caution and common sense to prevent injury to persons (incluiding themselves) and damage
to property, including vehicles.
3. Road Classification. To assist operators in safely using roads, the Road Agent, in cooperation with the
(Council/Selectmen/Manager/Commissioners), shall inspect and review the existing Municipality road system.
(A) Roads shall be classified according to the following standards:
thoroughfares
local service roads
rural or scenic roads
limited use roads
roads closed to passenger vehicles.
(B) The classification of a road under paragraph (A) shall not be deemed to guarantee that the road is
sufficient at any given time for use as indicated nor that the road will be maintained to any given standard. Instead, the
classification is merely an indication of the general quality of the road and the type of maintenance it usually receives.
[NOTE: An additional internal policy may specify the type of maintenance/inspection that each class of road will
receive.]
(C) The classification of existing roads shall be completed by , 200 . Upon completion of
the classification, the Selectmen/Municipality Manager shall determine the feasibility and wisdom of posting all or a
portion of the road system to indicate road classifications as so designated.
(D) When this review is undertaken by the municipality, as part thereof, the Road Agent shall post any
roads or sidewalks or segments thereof which are observed to contain potential safety hazards that are not reasonably
discoverable or avoidable by a prudent user. The (______________) shall determine if it is necessary to take further
action beyond posting which determination shall be within the discretion of the municipality’s governing board.
-10-
4. Notices of Insufficiency. This section identifies the municipality’s standard procedures for handling notice
of insufficiency in accordance with RSA 231:90 - :92. These procedures are in addition to the municipality’s inclement
weather policy adopted pursuant to RSA 231:92-a and are not intended to replace or impose a higher standard of care than
that stated in said policy. Only a notice which conforms in all respects to RSA 231:90 and this policy shall be deemed to
comply with said statute.
(A) In accordance with RSA 231:90, a written notice of insufficiency must be delivered to [one of the
Selectmen or village district commissioners] or the municipal road agent (or other title, e.g., public works director) [or in a
city, the mayor or street commissioners) with a written copy of the notice provided to the municipal clerk. In addition,
the municipality hereby delegates the authority to receive notices on behalf of said officials to [insert, for example, staff in
the municipal office.] The notice must be signed by the individual(s) providing the notice, and shall contain each signer’s
name printed legibly, along with the signer’s address and telephone number of other means of contact. In addition: the
notice shall:
(1) Contain the date and time of the notice
(2) Contain the date and time at which the insufficiency was observed;
(3) Describe, at least in general terms, the location of the insufficiency with such detail as may
permit it to be found without undue difficulty;
(4) Describe in reasonable detail the nature of the insufficiency.
(B) The municipality will provide forms upon which notices of insufficiency may be filed, but an
individual need not use that form if the notice conforms to the requirements of law and this policy.
(C) The municipality encourages other municipal officials and employees who may receive notice of an
insufficiency to advise individuals to report the insufficiency as required by law and to advise appropriate officials of
conditions called to their attention. However, the municipality cannot assure that any notice which is provided in a
manner other than that specified for a formal notice under this section will actually be received by the appropriate
official/employee and therefore must require that notices be provided as required by law and this policy.
(D) Upon receipt of a notice of insufficiency, the individual receiving the notice shall first indicate on
the notice or an appropriate form the exact time and date on which the notice is received and the identity of the person
with whom it is filed. Upon receipt, the __________ shall determine if the notice conforms to the requirements of this
policy and the law. It is the municipality’s intent to implement action to investigate any claimed notice of insufficiency
which is reasonably identified in a notice even if the notice does not formally conform to the requirements of law and this
policy, but the municipality does not thereby waive any immunity or limit of liability which otherwise would apply.
(1) As soon as practicable, a determination shall be made as to whether an insufficiency exists.
If it is determined that no insufficiency exists, the ____ shall promptly advise the person filing the notice, and shall
include a statement of the reasons why no insufficiency exists.
(2) If an insufficiency is found to exist, the municipality shall take one or more of the following
actions as appropriate to the circumstances and shall, at an appropriate time, notify the person filing the notice of the
actions taken or planned.
(a) If the insufficiency was temporary and no longer poses a hazard, the ___ shall determine the
likelihood of another occurrence and what action, if any, is required to prevent or post danger signals warning of such
conditions. In most such cases, the posting of danger signals is not required unless there is a reasonable likelihood of a
recurrence of the insufficiency.
(b) If the insufficiency is not temporary, the _________ shall as soon as practicable post danger
signals warning of the insufficiency. Within 72 hours after receipt of the notice of insufficiency, the _________ shall
develop a plan to remedy the insufficiency. The plan shall be implemented in good faith within a reasonable time. If the
insufficiency is not immediately remedied, appropriate danger signals shall be continued. The municipality may take
reasonable interim action and shall determine if danger signals continue to be required. The reasonableness of any
proposed remedy must consider the requirements that the expenditure of municipal funds may be made only in accordance
-11-
with proper procedures.
5. Municipal Observations and Inspections.
(A) Scheduled and Regular Inspections. As part of its routine road and sidewalk maintenance, the
municipality conducts periodic inspections of their condition.
(B) Actual Notice Observations.
(1) In accordance with RSA 231:92, I (b), any official or employee designated in subparagraph (5) (B)
(2) of this policy who has actual notice or knowledge of an insufficiency by means other than a written notice filed in
accordance with section 4 of this policy, shall promptly report such insufficiency to _________ who shall take the same
action as would be taken if the insufficiency was reported by formal written notice.
(2) The employees/officials required to act under subparagraph (5) (B) (1) are the following:
(selectman/commissioner/mayor/the municipal manager or municipal administrator/municipal clerk/ any on-duty fire or
police personnel/road agent/public works director).
(C) Casual Observations. Only knowledge by or notice to those officials or employees designated in
paragraph (5) (b) shall impose an obligation to act as provided by RSA 231:92. While the municipality is not designating
or authorizing any other municipal officials and employees to receive notice or otherwise commit the municipality to act,
in the interest of safety and efficiency, all municipal officials and employees are encouraged to be observant of highway
and sidewalk conditions and to advise _________ if they observe any conditions which they believe might pose a
problem. Any such advice provided to the municipality shall not constitute formal or actual notice or knowledge on the
part of the municipality unless made in accordance with section 4 or an official designated in paragraph (5) (B) (2) has
actual knowledge of an insufficiency through personal investigation or observation.
6. Inclement Weather Practices. In accordance with RSA 231:92-a, insufficiencies or hazards caused by snow,
ice, or other inclement weather shall be handled pursuant to the municipality’s inclement weather policies and procedures.

Town of Bristol
Building Use Policy
1. PURPOSE
The purpose of this policy is to set and define the approved uses of Town buildings.
2. DEPARTMENTS AFFECTED
This policy will affect all departments.
3. GENERAL USE POLICY
All Town buildings shall be used solely for the public business functions for which they were
intended. Use of the buildings for any other purpose requires prior approval by the Board of
Selectmen. Application for public uses of Town buildings may be made at the Land Use office
on the applicable form. Liability insurance must be provided by the petitioner and a fee for
rental and custodial services may be assessed. Approval of applications for use will normally
take place at the regularly scheduled meeting of the Board of Selectmen. The Board of
Selectmen may authorize the Town Administrator to execute applications for use of Town
buildings.
Proof of general liability/ bodily injury/ property damage insurance to cover the proposed use of
a Town building must be provided by the applicant with coverage limits of at least $300,000 per
occurrence/$1,000,000 aggregate. If alcohol is to be served at the event, insurance coverage
limits must be at least $500,000/$1,500,000, and policies must include coverage for alcoholrelated
incidents. The Town must be named on such policy as an additional insured/loss payee.
The user is responsible for obtaining, paying for, and maintaining such insurance. The Board of
Selectmen reserves the right to waive or reduce these insurance coverage requirements for
good cause demonstrated (including but not limited to the non-profit status of the applicant),
and to increase the requirements where it finds the risk posed by a particular event makes it
appropriate or prudent to do so.
There shall be an additional fee of $200.00 for use involving alcohol.
The rental fee for the use of a Town building is $200.00 per day for for-profit organizations and
$100.00 per day for non-profit organizations and private individuals. A rental fee waiver for nonprofit
organizations may be requested in writing.
A cleaning deposit of $200.00 must be submitted with the application. If the application is not
approved, the deposit will be returned. If the Town determines after the event that the building
was acceptably cleaned, the deposit fee will be returned to the user.
If food is to be served and/or prepared in the Town Hall, the Select Board wing is the only location
where food may be served and consumed.
No alcoholic beverages are permitted anywhere in a Town building under this Policy, unless the
user has obtained all necessary licenses and approvals from the NH State Liquor Commission
2 | P a g e
under RSA 178. Proof of license must be furnished to the Town at least 30 days before any such
use. Alcohol may only be served by a single licensed, insured and approved vendor, which will
be the sole source of alcoholic beverages at the event. The vendor must include the Town of
Bristol as an additional insured on its liability policies in relation to the event. Alcohol service
may occur only in a single designated and secure area, and shall be distributed only by the
vendor, and only to legally appropriate people. Intoxication is prohibited. Persons who are
intoxicated or who appear intoxicated shall not possess or consume alcohol, and must safely
leave the event without operating a motor vehicle. If alcohol is to be present at the event, at
least one police officer must be present at all times as determined by the Police Chief. The
applicant is responsible for obtaining prior approval from the Police Chief for the police detail,
and must pay all associated charges as required by the Police Chief. The applicant is solely
responsible for the adherence by all at the event to all federal, state and local laws and
regulations, and to all lawful orders of the officer(s) present, regarding the possession, sale, and
consumption of alcohol. The Town of Bristol reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to place
additional conditions on an event at which alcohol is to be served.
Access to a town building after normal business hours requires a key sign out. Forms and keys
can be obtained from Land Use/Health Officer or Deputy Health Officer at the Town Office during
normal business hours (there is no other option for obtaining a key). If the applicant does not
sign out their key during normal business hours, they may not be able to access the building for
their event. A key can be collected up to 24 hours before their event (with the exception of
Sunday events). There is a $25.00 fee for lost keys.
No smoking or use of candles, incense, lighters or open flames is permitted in any Town building
at any time.
The applicant is responsible for the observance by all attendees of Town and State fire and safety
laws and regulations.
At least one adult aged 18 or older must be present at all times during an event.
All applicants, by signing and submitting the application/facility license form, are deemed to have
read, understood and agreed to abide by all terms and conditions of (a) this Policy, (b) the
Application/Facility License form, and (c) any other applicable policies regarding the use of the
particular Town facility applied for.
The use of Town buildings by any non-municipal group or organization for any activity or
expression of any viewpoint does not constitute an endorsement of that activity or viewpoint(s)
by the Town.
4. CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL

TRUSTEE OF TRUST FUNDS
TOWN OF BRISTOL, NH
TRUST FUNDS INVESTMENT POLICY
Adopted July 16, 2007
Amended January 24, 2018
GENERAL
The overall portfolio should be managed in accordance with the Prudent Man or Prudent Person rule.
The definition of prudence is based on RSA 31:25-b as follows:
“a prudent investment is one which a prudent man would purchase for his own investment
having in view the preservation of the principal and the amount and regularity of the income to
be derived therefrom.”
The investment guidelines that follow provide direction as to our risk tolerance and general preferences.
This Investment Policy will be reviewed at least annually as required by New Hampshire laws.
THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE
The investment objective is to generate sufficient cash to meet each funds obligations and to increase
the value of each fund through capital appreciation. The objective dictates an asset allocation utilizing a
combination of equities, fixed income securities, and cash equivalents.
ASSET ALLOCATION
The asset allocation decision is the single most important factor in determining the performance of the
total portfolio for each fund. The current asset allocation guideline is as follows:
Equities 0%
Fixed Income 90% to 100% (amended to 0%)
Cash and Cash Equivalents 0% to 10% (amended to 0% to 100%)
FIXED INCOME
The fixed income portion of the portfolio should be managed as follows: The average maturity of the
debt securities should not exceed ten years nor should the average duration exceed five years. All fixed
income securities purchases shall have a minimum quality of “A” by either Mergent Bond Record
(formerly Moody’s Investor Services) or Stand and Poor’s Corporation. Concentration in any one issuer
shall not exceed ten percent except in obligations of the United States and/or the State of New
Hampshire and its subdivisions.
COMMON STOCKS
The equity investment should be in companies that have proven record of earnings’ growth, strong
fundamentals, and good valuations. The majority of the equity position should be in larger capitalization
companies (stock that have a market capitalization of over $15 billion), with only a small percentage
devoted to mid cap (stocks with a market capitalization between $1 and $15 billion) and small cap
(stocks that have less than $1 billion in market capitalization). The equity portion of the portfolio must
be broadly diversified. At the security level, the purchase of a single security should not exceed five
percent of the equity portion of the portfolio. The maximum exposure to any one name, because the
price appreciation, should not exceed twenty percent of the equities.
PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT
The performance results should be reviewed on a year-to-date basis. For comparison purposes, the
equity performance should be compared to the Stand and Poor (or S & P) 500 and the Lehman
Government/Corporate Index.
MEETINGS
The trustees should meet to review the portfolio at least once a year. During the meeting, the trustees
should review the Investment Policy and, if necessary, make changes where appropriate. As part of the
review, the trustees should discuss the investment objective, asset allocation, performance,
diversification, and general compliance with guidelines. In addition, the information presented should
reflect “where we were”, “where are we now”, and “where are we going.”
DEFINITIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS
There are two funds which have slightly different uses and demands. The private funds are required to
be managed to carry out the terms of the donor. The public funds are the capital reserve funds.
CAPITAL RESERVE FUNDS
The capital reserve funds are required to be invested only by deposit in some savings bank or savings
department of a national bank or trust company, or in the shares of a cooperative bank, building and
loan association, or federal savings and loan association, in this state or in bonds, notes or other
obligations of the United States government, in bonds or notes of this state, in such stock and bonds as
are legal for investment by New Hampshire savings banks, or in participation united in the public deposit
investment pool established pursuant to RSA 383:22.

the delivery of water service is conditional upon their acceptance. All or any part of their terms,
conditions and rates may be changed or deleted and new terms, conditions or rates may be added

rules in such cases where an injustice due to strict enforcement of these rules may be imposed. If
a special exception is made, however, it shall not be construed as establishing a precedent in
cases of future consideration.
Whenever these rules and regulations are in conflict with State & Federal regulations, the more
stringent regulation will take precedence.
METERED SERVICE
Only metered water service is available to those wishing to take water from the Bristol Water
Department.
INTERRUPTIONS
The BWD will not guarantee an uninterrupted or unlimited full supply of water, but will use its
best endeavors to give satisfaction to all users.
5
RULES AND REGULATIONS
Section 1: APPLICATION FOR WATER SERVICE
Application for water service must be made in writing at the office of the BWD on forms
provided by the BWD. On acceptance of the Selectmen and/or the Superintendent, the
application shall constitute a contract between the BWD and the property owner, obligating the
applicant to pay the BWD established rates and charges and comply with the rules and
regulations. All previous charges for the services, charges and fees of an established customer
must be paid in full prior to the issuance of an application to a new customer at the same
location.
Should a 50% greater than annual average consumption be a continuous demand due to a change
in original customer status i.e. addition of an apartment, change from residence to restaurant,
etc., the customer desiring the same shall notify the BWD in writing in advance of such
anticipated requirements or, on the building permit with the Town of Bristol. The BWD shall
not be obligated to satisfy the increased requirement to the detriment of the entire system.
Service will not be increased until receipt by the BWD of such signed application and approved
building permit and payment of all associated charges and fees (see Addendum-Fee Schedule)
Acceptance of service by the customer shall be on the express conditions that the BWD shall not
be liable for any damage caused by the bursting of pipe, collapse or leakage of customer’s
equipment nor any leakage from any pipes, fixtures or other appliances wherever located
between the main pipe and the point of leakage for any cause whatsoever. The BWD shall not be
liable for damage to fences, walls shrubbery, walks, lawns or any other portion of the customer’s
premises caused by work or installations by the BWD under the direction of the Superintendent.
The BWD personnel will use maximum care to correct any damage done during emergency
construction.
The BWD shall have no obligation to supply water to any structure which contains plumbing not
in compliance with the BOCA code.
The BWD reserves the right to assign the size and location for the water service. Size of the
service pipe will be in compliance with BOCA plumbing code.
Applications will be accepted subject to there being an existing main in a street or right-of-way
abutting on the premises to be served and only if adequate pressure and flow exists, but
acceptance shall in no way obligate the BWD to extend its main to service the premises.
Section 2: INSTALLATION, OWNERSHIP AND MAINTENANCE OF SERVICE PIPE
All service pipes, including the shutoff, within the limits of the highway, except seasonal surface
pipe, shall be owned and maintained by the BWD (see Appendix A-2). From the curb stop to the
building, the service pipe shall be installed, owned and maintained by the customer. All service
pipes between the shutoff and the building wall shall have a minimum cover of six (6) feet.
6
Section 3: TRANSFER OF WATER SERVICE
Whenever an owner sells or transfers property for which application for service has been granted,
the owner (or his agent) shall promptly notify the BWD in writing, giving the name and address
of the new owner(s) who must then make application for further service of that property.
Applications may be obtained at the BWD office. New customers have no right to continue use
of the water at the premises until such application for service for the new owner is in effect. (See
Appendix A-3)
The seller, at the time of closing, will pay for water usage, including minimum charge, for the
current quarter. At the next billing, the new owners will be charged for usage, plus a processing
fee thereby assuring that only one minimum charge per quarter is assessed by BWD.
Section 4: ALTERATIONS IN PIPES
No customer shall install any additions, extensions or alterations of any service pipe or pipes for
any purpose not mentioned in the customer’s application without first giving written notice to the
BWD and obtaining the BWD’s approval (see Appendix A-4).
Section 5: WORK ON CUSTOMER’S PREMISES
It shall be the responsibility of the customer to install new and replacement services from the
curb stop to the structure including the meter, valves, and horn, and the customer shall be
responsible for all costs incurred in connections with such installation. All materials used on the
installation of a service pipe shall conform to BWD standards. All service pipes within the
approximate limits of a highway including the curb stop shall be installed to BWD specifications.
Upon installation of an approved service, the BWD shall service the meter as well as that part of
the service from the main to the curb stop. All costs resulting from the abuse or destruction of a
meter shall be borne by the customer (see Addendum-rates).
Section 6: TEMPORARY SERVICE
Application of builders, contractors, real estate developers and others for temporary water
service will be accepted and temporary water service will be supplied providing, when in the
opinion of the Selectmen, it does not interfere with the use of water for general purposes. A
temporary water fee will be charged for each occasion (See Appendix-A6). In addition, the
quantity of water taken for such purposes shall be determined by meter and shall be paid for in
accordance with the rate schedule in effect. Customers requiring temporary water service shall
reimburse the BWD for all expenses in conjunction with providing the necessary temporary
service connections. An approved backflow prevention device will be utilized commensurate
with the degree of hazard involved.
When permission to open a street cannot be obtained or when, for any physical reason, it is
impractical to make excavation and provide independent service, water may be furnished
temporarily from an adjacent service if deemed advisable by the BWD and the owner grants
permission; but such service delivery shall be entirely at the expense of the customer requesting
such service. Application must be in writing and approved by the BWD Selectmen. An
approved backflow prevention device will be utilized. (See Appendix A-6)
7
Section 7: SEASONAL SERVICE
Seasonal service is one which supplies premises for only a portion of the year and will be shut
off during our scheduled seasonal turn-off dates, usually the two weeks after Columbus Day and
will not be turned back on until the last two weeks of April. Seasonal customers will receive two
billing cycles that will include turn-off and turn-on fees.
Year round customers servicing seasonal units through a master meter may apply for and
purchase individual meters in order to categorize unit as seasonal to avoid year round billing
status.
Section 8: WATER PROBLEMS
The BWD may not grant permission to install any mainline service lines, or service connections
between November 1 and April 15, except by special arrangement.
In those cases where customer-owned service pipe or main is frozen, the thawing shall be done
by the BWD at the expense of the customer. To avoid a recurrence, the BWD may order an
examination of the customer’s service pipe or main, at the customer’s expense and if the same is
not at a depth of six feet, as required, the BWD reserves the right to require it to be relocated
before service is resumed (see Appendix A-5).
When it becomes necessary to thaw a frozen service pipe, and it cannot be determined where it is
frozen, and the customer requests that the service pipe be thawed by the BWD the total cost of
the work shall be paid by the customer. (See Appendix A-8)
Section 9: JOINT USE OF PIPE TRENCH
Water service pipes will not be placed in the same trench with gas pipes, electric conduits,
drains, sewers, or similar structures except under special conditions and only with prior approval
of the BWD. The distance and manner of installation between utilities will be determined by the
New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission’s regulations and the BWD.
Section 10: MAINTENANCE OF PLUMBING
All customers shall maintain the plumbing and fixtures within their own premises in good repair
and protect from freezing at their own expense. They shall make any repairs which may be
necessary to prevent leaks and damage.
Section 11: CROSS CONNECTIONS
The words “cross connection” shall mean any actual or potential physical connection or
arrangement between two otherwise separate systems, one of which contains potable water and
the other which contains water of unknown or questionable safety and/or stream, chemicals,
gases or other contaminants whereby there may be a flow of an unapproved water to the BWD
water supply.
8
Cross Connection Control: The BWD has published an established set of rules to administer a
cross-connection control program to protect the public water supply system (see Appendix B).
No cross connection within the system will be allowed unless protected by an approved backflow
preventer commensurate with the degree of potential hazard. All such consumption within the
premises shall pass through the protective device. The Superintendent is further empowered to
establish and see that certain fees and charges associated with inspection and testing of premises
and devices are collected. Said fees and charges shall be as outlined in Appendix A-9.
No cross connection between the BWD’s water supply and any other supply will be allowed,
unless such connections are properly protected by backflow preventers approved by both the
BWD and the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission (RSA 148.B2).
No connections capable of causing a backflow between the BWD’s water supply system and any
plumbing fixture device or appliance, or between any waste outlet or pipe having direct
connection to waste drains will be permitted. If such connections are discovered and the owner
of such connection fails or refuses to beak or properly protect the connection within a 24-hour
time period after notification of the cross-connection, the BWD shall discontinue service, making
a definite break in the water service pipe until the connection has been properly changed. A fine
will be imposed and collected in full prior to reestablishing the water supply (see Appendix A-9).
Section 12: SAFEGUARDING DIRECT PRESSURE WATER DEVICES & SYSTEM
SUPPLIED BY AUTOMATIC FEED VALVES.
All customers having direct pressure water devices, including but not limited to hot water tanks,
or secondary systems supplied by automatic feed valves shall have installed and maintained in
operating condition appropriate vacuum, temperature, and pressure relief valves or cutouts in the
water system and/or secondary system to prevent damage to the water device or secondary
system or their appurtenances should it become necessary to shut off the water main or service or
should a pressure failure occur for any other reason. Water service supplied to any customer not
providing such protective devices will be strictly at the risk of the customer, and the BWD will
not be held liable for damage resulting from the lack of or failure of such protective devices. The
BWD shall not be liable for damages to any hot water tank or direct pressure devices on the
customer’s premises.
In cases requiring an immediate shutdown of mains piping due to emergency situations, the
BWD shall make reasonable attempt to notify its customers but lack of notification shall not
cause BWD to be liable for damage of equipment inside the customer’s facility.
Section 13: FLUCTUATION OF PRESSURES BY CUSTOMER’S APPARATUS
No customer shall install or use water consumption apparatus which will affect the BWD
pressure or operating conditions so as to interfere with the service of another customer. Where a
customer has or proposes to install apparatus which requires water in sudden and/or material
quantities, impairing the pressure to the detriment, damage or disadvantage of other customers,
the BWD reserves the right to require such customer to install such devices or apparatus which
will confine such fluctuation of demand or reduction of pressure within reasonable limits as
determined by the BWD.
9
If the customer, after receiving written notice from the BWD, fails to present an acceptable
remedial plan with a limit set by the BWD, service will be discontinue.
Section 14: BILLS PAYABLE
Bills for water service will be due and payable, upon presentation of the bill. The failure of the
customer or representative to receive written notice of the water bill does not relieve the
customer from the obligation of its payment nor from the consequences of its nonpayment. All
charges are due and payable upon presentation of the bill and are past due thirty (30) days after
the date of the bill. The Superintendent or his representatives are not authorized to accept
monies due the BWD by delinquent customers.
Section 15: DISCONTINUANCE OF SERVICE
Service may be discontinued by reason of nonpayment of water bills or violation of any rule or
regulation contained herein. Once discontinued, services may not be reconnected until the cause
of complaint resulting in discontinuance of service has been removed and until reconnection
charges (see Appendix A-10), plus arrearages, if any, have been paid. Service will also be
discontinued without notice in case of fraudulent use or violation of Section#10 or 11 of these
Rules & Regulations.
If a bill for water service is not paid within thirty (30) days after the issue date, the BWD
reserves the right to assess a penalty (see appendix A-10) and discontinue the service after twelve
(12) days from the date of mailing a shut-off notice to the customer addressed to him at the
address on file at the BWD office. Reconnection will not be made until all previous charges for
water including penalties have been paid plus the reconnection fee. All charges for water shall
constitute a lien, in accordance with the terms of NH Revised Annotated Chapter 38, Sec. 22.
When service has been discontinued for nonpayment of a bill, the charge for reconnection shall
be the current turn on fee, payable in advance (see Appendix A-10).
The charges for turning water on or off (by appointment) at the customer’s request shall be
posted at the office of the BWD. Only BWD personnel may turn water on and off at the curb
stop.
The BWD may take a customer to Small Claims Court to collect payment. All cost associated
with court, sheriff and lawyer fees shall be borne to the customer.
The BWD will assess a charge for a check returned for insufficient funds, this charge will be set
by the BWD. (See Appendix A-10)
Section 16: RESPONSIBILITY FOR WATER CHARGES
Charges for services furnished by the BWD or under any agreement between the BWD and the
customer shall continue to the end of the term specified or until such time as the BWD shall
receive reasonable notice from the customer of a desire to terminate the service.
10
The BWD requires that there shall be one meter per unit. It is the intent of the BWD that there
be one meter per unit, a unit is a separate living, commercial or industrial space. It shall be
deemed a violation of the contract between the BWD and the customer if a customer is found to
be extending their water service to another unit within the building or to another building located
on the same premises without having notified the BWD and having obtained documented
permission for such extension. The practice shall be considered “unauthorized use of water” and
subject to the penalty listed in (Appendix A-12).
Where there is more than one customer unit in a building supplied with water, the BWD shall
require that the owner of the premises will be responsible for payment of all charges for water
service rendered to the property billed in accordance with the rates on file with BWD. Owner is
responsible for all water charges incurred by tenants. These bills will automatically become a
lien on the property.
If a developer proposes connection of a project having a condominium form of ownership, which
will eventually be operated and managed by an association of owners, the following rules shall
apply:
1. For new or totally re-plumbed and remodeled structures, individual meters to each unit shall
be required. Each unit owner will apply for service and establish an account with the BWD
as an individual customer.
A laundry facility will require a separate meter and its cost and the cost of water metered will
be the responsibility of the association.
A copy of the association’s by-laws will be provided to BWD if requested.
2. For a condominium conversion of an apartment building having a single master meter, the
association of owners will be responsible for payment of the water charges. The fees for a
master meter shall be as presented in Addendum/rates with its latest modifications. Each
customer shall pay the minimum per unit base cost (for each unit), plus any additional
consumption charges for water use over the 500 CF per customer base. Conversion of
apartments to condominiums will require approval of the BWD prior to receiving final
Planning Board approval.
A laundry facility within a multi-unit complex will not be considered a unit.
Plans and specifications for water main extensions must be submitted to the BWD and to the
Planning Board through the BWD.
Plans and specifications shall show all water line extensions in plan and profile, showing all
other underground utilities including sewer, storm drainage, electrical, cable TV, telephone, etc.
These plans shall be designed and stamped by a NH registered professional engineer. Plans shall
be at a scale of not smaller than 1”=50 feet. As-built Mylar’s shall be provided to the BWD upon
completion of the project. The requirements for as-built drawings shall be determined by the
BWD.
Water lines shall not be allowed on grades over 15%. If a water line is routed cross-country, a
year-round maintained gravel road over the line will be required. Water lines may not be laid
deeper than 10 feet from finish grade.
11
New water main installations shall be designed in compliance with Bristol’s current
specifications available at the office of the BWD.
All new installations shall be in compliance with the current version of the Insurance Service
Office (ISO) Fire Suppression Rating Schedule, regarding needed fire flow and pressure.
Building construction shall be in compliance with the current building codes in effect for Bristol.
Any proposed sprinkler system shall meet ISO and the National Fire Protection Association
(NFPA) Section 13 requirements. The BWD reserves the right to refuse service to structures
which will not comply with the ISO Fire Suppression Rating Schedule for needed fire flow.
Section 17: ACCESS OF PREMISES
The officers or agents of the BWD shall have free access to all premises supplied with water, at
all reasonable hours, to permit the inspection of plumbing and fixtures, to set remove or read
meter, to ascertain the amount of water used and manner of use, and to enforce these Rules and
Regulations. The customer agrees to indemnify and hold harmless BWD, its agents and
employees, from any and all liability, claims, and causes of action arising out of any such entry
or inspection.
Section 18: PAYMENTS
When a customer’s credit is, or becomes impaired, the BWD may, when it deems necessary to
guarantee payment of current bills, require a signed payment agreement between the BWD and
the customer
Section 19: NO LIABILITY FOR INTERRUPTED OR UNSATISFACTORY SERVICE
If, by reason of shortage of supply or for the purpose of making repairs, extension or
connections, or for any other reason beyond the control of the BWD, it becomes necessary to
shut off water in the mains, the BWD will not be responsible, and have no liability, directly or
indirectly, for claims for any damages occasioned by such shutoff and no refunds of charges will
be allowed unless the interruption is in effect for a continuous period in excess of ten (10) days,
in which case a proportional refund will be made. Notice of shutoff will be given when
practicable, but nothing in this rule shall be construed as requiring the giving of such notice.
The BWD will not be responsible for damage caused by dirty water, which may be occasioned
by cleaning pipes, reservoirs, or standpipes, or the opening of any gates or hydrants unless the
damage is caused or occasioned by the gross negligence of the Department.
The BWD will publish notices when the water turbidity is in excess of that prescribed by law.
Section 20: RESTRICTION OF WATER USES
The BWD reserves the right, in periods of drought or emergency or when deemed essential to the
protection of the public health, safety and welfare, to restrict, curtail or prohibit the use of water
for secondary purposes, such as sprinkling, car washing, air conditioning or filling swimming
pools, and shall have the right to establish the hours and periods when water may be used for
such purposes.
12
Section 21: UNAUTHORIZED USE OF WATER
Use of water is confined to the premises named in the contract. No customer shall supply
another not entitled to the use of water, nor shall he use it for any purpose not mentioned in his
application. No person shall obtain water service from any hydrant, fountain, or other fixture of
the BWD without previous consent of the BWD. (See Appendix A-11 for penalty)
Section 22: ABATEMENTS
Abatements towards bills may be issued, on the sewer portion, due to excessive use of water as a
result of a leak on the property, not discharged into the sewer system, example, broken hose bib
or broken pipe, by notifying the BWD in writing of dates and approximate amounts.
Abatements will be given if a meter read proves to be inaccurate or misread.
(See Section 23)
The amount abated shall be credited by the BWD at the time of the next quarterly billing after
the time from which the abatement is claimed. Abatements will not be granted after a six month
period from the occurrence.
Section 23: METERS
Anyone may make written application for metered service. The size of the meter will, in all
cases, be determined by the BWD. The BWD may install meters whenever deemed expedient.
Each new customer pays a new meter service connection fee, after which the BWD maintains
and makes changes as necessary. The meter will remain the property of the BWD (see Appendix
A-12 for customer charges).
If the owner(s) of a multi-unit complex served by a single meter choose to install individual
meters to all units, the BWD will supply, at the customer’s expense, meters and related
equipment deemed necessary and will install under the supervision of the Superintendent. This
is not considered a new service.
METER SETTINGS: All meters shall be set, as nearly as possible, at the point of entrance of the
service pipe to the building, in a proper and readily accessible location for all purposes including
removal, and must have a meter horn with a valve on the street side of the meter and a backflow
preventer valve on the house side of the meter. The cost of installation shall be borne by the
customer (see Appendix A-12). Meters once set may be changed in location at the request of the
customer, only at his expense, and provided such change has been duly authorized by the BWD.
METER NON SEWER: To have a “spigot unit” installed at a residence, it would require a meter
horn, valve and dual check at the cost of (see Addendum B), or the cost at the time of the
application for the meter. This needs to be installed by a licensed plumber with an employee of
the Bristol Water Department on site to over see the installation. This is for outside use only,
and can be checked at anytime by an employee of the BWD. This meter rate is at 100% water
usage, and the original meter will be billed at 100% water and 100% sewer. This can not be a
seasonal meter.
13
METER BOXES: When the customer fails or neglects to furnish a suitable location for the
meter inside his building, or where for other reasons it is necessary or expedient to locate the
meter in an underground box or vault, the customer shall bear the expense of same.

charged to the customer.
AUXILIARY METERS: Additional or auxiliary meter designed by the customer will be
allowed. The BWD will furnish, supervise installation and maintain them at the customer’s
expense.
FAILURE TO REGISTER: If a meter fails to register, or if it is removed for the purpose of
making repairs, the BWD will make a charge for the water used based on the average of the
amount registered over similar periods preceding or subsequent thereof.
TESTING: Meters tested at the customers request and found to register within 2%, plus or
minus, will be deemed correct and the customer will be responsible for the testing fee (see
Appendix A-12).
If the meter is found to register over more than 2%, the testing fee will not be charged and the
percentage of error in billing computed for the duration of the last billing period will be credited
to the customers account.
If the meter does not register within the plus or minus 2% margin of accuracy, the meter will be
replaced at no charge to the customer. The customer will not be responsible for the testing fee.
A written report, giving the result of such test, shall be made to the customer.
The testing of meters and the charges of such testing will be done in accordance with the
requirements of the meter testing rules and regulations of the New Hampshire Public Utilities
Commission.
Section 24: HYDRANTS
Fire hydrants may be used only for the extinguishment of fires or for such purposes as may be
approved by the BWD. Hydrants shall be opened only by an agent of the BWD or a regular

Section 26: PRIVATE FIRE PROTECTION
Customers desiring private fire protection should first consult with the BWD for this service.
Installation of the fire protection services shall be by, or under the direction of, and shall meet all
standards of the BWD. All charges therefore are payable by the customer. However, once
installed and placed in service, that portion of the fire protection pipe lying between the main and
the property line shall become the property of the BWD and shall henceforth be owned and
maintained by the BWD.
No private fire connection will be made to a water main of less than 8 inches in diameter and no
private fire connection service itself shall be less than 6 inches in diameter. A private fire

backflow prevention device on the specific cross-connection permit application.
The owner shall apply for a cross-connection permit on the appropriate forms provided by the
BWD.
Permits shall be renewed every five years or whenever a change occurs in the classification of
hazard and/or backflow prevention device as determined by the BWD.

SEVERABILITY
If any provision of these guidelines is held at law to be invalid or
inapplicable to any person or circumstances, the remaining
provisions will continue in full force and effect.
CONFIDENTIALITY OF INFORMATION
Information given by or about an applicant or recipient of
general assistance is confidential and privileged, and is not a
public record under the provisions of RSA 91-A. Such
information will not be published, released, or discussed with
any individual or agency without written permission of the
applicant or recipient except when disclosure is required by
law, or when necessary to carry out the purposes of RSA 165.
RSA 165:2-c.
ROLES OF GOVERNING BODY AND WELFARE OFFICIAL
The responsibility of the day-to-day administration of the
general assistance program shall be vested in the appointed
Welfare Director. The Welfare Director shall administer the
general assistance program in accordance with the written
guidelines of the municipality. The local governing body, the
Board of Selectmen, is responsible for the adoption of the
guidelines relative to general assistance. RSA 165:1(11).
LOCAL WELFARE ADMINISTRATOR AND AVAILABILTY
The town may appoint a Welfare Director to carry out the
town’s local welfare responsibilities. If there is not Director, the
duty falls to the Board of Selectmen (RSA 37:6, VIII).
The Welfare Director must be available, or there must be
access to the welfare program, five (5) days per week. The
8
Welfare Director without full-time office hours must post
telephone numbers where he/she, or an alternate official, may
be reached. In an emergency situation, a person must be able
to receive aid of which he/she is eligible within 72 hours of
making an application. The governing body should delegate
the dual responsibilities of receiving an application and making
an emergency aid decision to someone who is available
during business hours, such as a single selectman, the
administrative assistance, or an appointed welfare
administrator.
Under state law, the Welfare Director shall have immunity from
liability so long as they are acting in good faith. (RSA 31:104
and case law).
Under federal civil rights law, it does not matter whether the
official was personally acting in good faith. It is whether a
reasonable person would have known that actions taken
would violate constitutional rights. Under federal law, there is a
presumption that the Welfare Director knows what the client’s
constitutional rights are. RSA 31:106 mandates the municipality
to indemnify any official who was acting in good faith, but was
held liable under the civil rights law.
9
MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS
10
LEGAL REQUIREMENT
Each Welfare Director is required by law to keep complete
paper and/or electronic records concerning the number of
applicants given assistance and the cost for such support.
Separate case records shall be established for each individual
or family applying for general assistance. The purposes for
keeping such are records are:
• To provide a valid basis of accounting for
expenditures of the municipality’s funds;
• To support decisions concerning the applicant’s
eligibility;
• To assure availability of information if the applicant
or recipient seeks administrative or judicial review of
the Welfare Director’s decision;
• To provide the Welfare Director with accurate
statistical information and;
• To provide a complete history of an applicant’s
needs and assistance that might aid the Welfare
Director in ongoing case management and in
referring the applicant to appropriate agencies.
CASE RECORDS
The Welfare Director shall maintain case records containing
the following information:
• The complete application including any
authorizations signed by the applicant allowing
the Welfare Director to obtain or verify any
pertinent information in the course of assisting the
recipient, to include a signed Authorization to
Release information from the New Hampshire
Department of Health and Human Services.
• Written grounds for approval or denial of an
application contained in a Notice of Decision.
11
• A narrative history recording need for assistance,
the results of investigations of applicant’s
circumstances, referrals, changes in status, etc.
• A tally sheet, which has complete data
concerning the type, amount, and dates of
assistance given which may be kept on paper or
electronically.
12
APPLICATION PROCESS
13
RIGHT TO APPLY
Anyone may apply for general assistance by appearing in
person or through an authorized representative and by
completing a written or electronic application form. If more
than one adult resides in a household, each may be
required to appear at the welfare office to apply for
assistance, unless one is working or otherwise reasonably
unavailable. Unrelated adults in the applicant’s residential
unit may be required to apply separately if they do not meet
the definition of household as defined in these guidelines.
Each adult in the household may be requested to sign
release of information forms.
The Welfare Director shall not be required to accept an
application for general assistance from a recipient who is
subject to a suspension (RSA 165:1-b; VI) provided that any
applicant who contests a determination of continuing noncompliance
with the guidelines may request a fair hearing,
and provided further that an recipient who has been
suspended for at least 6 months due to non-compliance
may file a new application.
WELFARE DIRECTOR’S RESPONSIBILITY AT TIME OF APPLICATION

Welfare Director shall inform the applicant of:
• The requirement of submitting an application, and at
the time of each request for assistance, an intake form.
The Welfare Director shall provide assistance to the
applicant in completing the application, if necessary
(e.g. applicant is physically or mentally unstable, or has
a language barrier.
• Eligibility requirements, including a general description
of the guideline amounts and the eligibility
requirement.
14
• The applicant’s right to a fair hearing, and the manner
in which a review may be obtained.
• The applicant’s responsibility for reporting all facts
necessary to determine eligibility, and for presenting
records and documents as requested and as
reasonably available to support statements.
• The joint responsibility of the Welfare Director and
applicant for exploring facts concerning eligibility,
needs, and resources.
• The kinds of verifications needed.

• The requirement of placing a lien on any real property
owned by the recipient, or any civil judgments or
property settlements, for any assistance given, except
for good cause
• The fact that reimbursement from the recipient will be
sought if he/she becomes able to repay the amount of
assistance given.
• The applicant’s right to review the guidelines.
• The applicant’s responsibility not to voluntarily
terminate employment without good cause, as
required by RSA 165:1-d and
• Any other responsibility the applicant has or will have.
15
RESPONSIBILITY OF EACH APPLICANT AND RECIPIENT
At the time of initial application, and at all times thereafter,
the applicant/recipient has the following responsibilities:
• To provide accurate, complete, and current
information concerning needs and resources and the
whereabouts and circumstances of relatives who may
be responsible under RSA 165:19.
• To notify the Welfare Director promptly when there is a
change in needs, resources, address, or household size.
• To apply immediately, but no later than 7 days from

resources, public or private, that will reduce or
eliminate the need for general assistance. RSA 165:1-b,
I(d).

• To provide records and other pertinent information and
access to said records and information when
requested.
• To provide a doctor’s statement if claiming an inability
to work due to medical problems.

(including arrears), utilities, medications, medical bills,
16
and child care. A copy of the applicant’s Income Tax
Return/Refund must be provided. Not doing so may be
considered fraud and will be prosecuted accordingly.
An applicant shall be denied assistance if he/she fails to fulfill
any of these responsibilities without justification. A recipient’s
assistance may be terminated or suspended for failure to fulfill
any of these responsibilities without reasonable justification.
Any recipient may be denied or terminated from general
assistance or may be prosecuted for a criminal offense if
he/she, by means of intentionally false statements or intentional
misrepresentation, or by impersonation or other willfully
fraudulent act or device, obtains or attempts to obtain any
assistance to which he/she is not entitled.
ACTIONS ON APPLICATIONS
1. Decision: Unless an application is withdrawn, the Welfare
Director shall make a decision concerning the applicant’s
eligibility immediately in the case of an emergency, or
within 5 working days after submission of the application.
A written Notice of Decision shall be given in hand,
delivered or mailed on the same day or next working day
following the making of the decision. The Notice of
Decision shall state that assistance of a specific kind and
amount has been given and the time period of aid, or
that the application has been denied, in whole or in part,
with reasons for denial. A decision may also be made to
suspend an application subject to receipt of specified
information from the applicant. The Notice of Decision
shall contain a first notice of conditions for continued
assistance and shall notify the applicant of his/her right to
a fair hearing if dissatisfied with the Welfare Director’s
decision. (RSA 165:1-b, II, III).
2. Emergency Assistance: If, at the time of initial contact,
the applicant demonstrates and verifies that an
17
immediate need exists, because of which the applicant
may suffer a loss of a basic necessity of living or imminent
threat to life or health (such as loss of shelter, utilities, heat,
or lack or food or prescriptions), then temporary aid to fill
such immediate need shall be given immediately,
pending a decision on the application. Such emergency
assistance shall not obligate the Welfare Director to
provide further assistance after the application process if
completed.
3. Temporary Assistance: In circumstances where required
records are not available, the Welfare Director may give
temporary approval of an application pending receipt of
required documents. Temporary status shall not extend
beyond 2 weeks. The Welfare Director shall not insist on
documentary verification if such records are totally
unavailable.
4. Withdrawn applications: An application shall be
considered withdrawn if:
• The applicant has refused to complete an
application or has refused to make a good faith
effort to provide required verifications and sufficient
information for the completion of an application. If
an application is deemed withdrawn for these
reasons, the Welfare Director shall so notify the
applicant in a written Notice of Decision.
• The applicant dies before assistance is rendered.
• The applicant avails him/herself of other resources to
meet the need in place of assistance.
• The applicant requests that the application be
withdrawn (preferably in writing).
• The applicant does not contact the Welfare Director
after the initial interview after being requested to do
so.
18
HOME VISITS
A home visit may be made by appointment at the request of
any applicant, only when it is impossible for the applicant or
representative to apply in person.
The home visit shall be conducted in such a manner as to
preserve, to the greatest extent possible, the privacy and
dignity of the applicant. To this end, the person conducting the
visit shall not be in uniform or travel in a law enforcement
vehicle, shall be polite and courteous, and shall not knowingly
discuss or mention the application within the listening area of
someone who is not a member of the household.
RIGHT TO APPLY
Any determination or investigation of need or eligibility shall be
conducted in a manner that will not violate the privacy or
personal dignity of the individual or harass or violate his or her
individual rights.
REQUIRED VERIFICATIONS
Verification will normally be required of the following:
• Applicant’s address
• Facts relevant to the applicant’s residence
• Names of persons in applicant’s residential unit
• Applicant’s and household income and assets
• Applicant’s and household’s financial obligations
• The physical and mental condition of household
members, only where relevant to their receipt of
assistance, such as ability to work, determination of needs,
or referral to other forms of assistance
• Any special circumstances claimed by applicant
• Applicant’s employment status and availability in the
labor market
19
• Names, addresses, and employment status of potentially
liable relatives
• Utility costs
• Housing costs
• Prescriptions costs
• Any other costs that the applicant wishes to claim as a
necessity.
VERIFICATION RECORDS
Verification may be made through records provided by the
applicant (for example, birth and marriage certificates; pay
stubs; rent receipts; bankbooks; etc.) as primary sources. The
failure of the applicant to bring such records does not affect
the Welfare Director’s responsibility to process the application
promptly. The Welfare Director shall inform the applicant what
records are necessary, and the applicant is required to
produce records possessed as soon as possible. The applicant
shall be required to fill out and sign the verifications form and to
produce the information required on that form. However, the
Welfare Director shall not insist on documentary verification if
such are records are not available, but should ask the
applicant to suggest alternative means of verification.
OTHER SOURCES OF VERIFICATION
Verification may also be made through other sources, such as
relatives, employers, former employers, banks, school
personnel, and social government agencies. The cashier of a
nation bank or a treasurer of a savings and trust company is
authorized by law to furnish information regarding amounts
deposited to the credit of an applicant or recipient. (RSA
165:4).
20
WRITTEN CONSENT OF APPLICANT
When information is sought from other sources, the Welfare
Director shall explain to the applicant or recipient what
information is desired, how it will be used, and the necessity of
obtaining it in order to establish eligibility. Before contact is
made with other sources, the Welfare Director shall obtain
written consent of the applicant or recipient, unless the Welfare
Director has reasonable grounds for fraud. In the case of
suspected fraud, the Welfare Director shall carefully record
his/her reasons and actions, and before any accusation or
confrontation is made, the applicant shall be given an
opportunity to explain or clarify the suspicious circumstances.
LEGALLY LIABLE RELATIVES
The Welfare Director may seek statements from the applicant’s
legally liable relatives regarding their ability to help support the
applicant.
REFUSAL TO VERIFY INFORMATION
Should the applicant or recipient refuse comment and/or
indicate an unwillingness to have the Welfare Director seek
further information that is necessary, assistance may be denied
for lack of eligibility verifications.
21
DISBURSEMENTS
The Town of Bristol pays in a voucher system – RSA 165:1(III).
Vouchers are payable directly to the vendors (utilities,
landlords, stores, etc.) involved.
The amount shown on the voucher is the maximum amount to
be used for payment. In accordance with the municipality’s
accounting practices, a recipient may be required to sign the
voucher to insure proper usage. After the initial transaction, if
there is any unspent money, the vendor shall notify by invoice
the municipality for the payment of the actual amount listed on
an itemized bill or register tape. Vouchers altered by the
recipient or vendor will not be honored.
22
DETERMINATION OF ELIGIBILITY AND AMOUNT
23
ELIGIBILITY FORMULA
An applicant is eligible to receive assistance when:
• He/She meets the non-financial eligibility factors and
• The applicant’s basic maintenance need exceeds his/her
available income plus available liquid assets. If available
income and available liquid assets exceed the basic
maintenance need (as determined by the guideline
amounts), the applicant is not eligible for general
assistance. If the need exceeds the available
income/assets, the amount of assistance shall be the
difference between the two amounts, in the absence of
circumstances deemed by the Welfare Director to justify
an exception.
LEGAL STANDARD AND INTERPRETATION
“Whenever a person in any Town if poor and unable to support
himself, he shall be relieved and maintained by the overseers of
public welfare of such Town, whether or not he has residence
there.” RSA 165:1
1. An applicant cannot be denied assistance because
he/she is not a resident.
2. “Whenever” means at any or whatever time that person is
poor and unable to support him or herself.
a. The Welfare Director, or a person authorized to act
on his/her behalf, shall be available during normal
business hours.
b. The eligibility of any applicant for general assistance
shall be determined no later than 5 working days
after the application is submitted. If the applicant
has an emergency need, then assistance for such
an emergency need shall be immediately.
c. Assistance shall begin as soon as the applicant is
determined to be eligible.
24
3. “Poor and unable to support” means that an individual
lacks income and available liquid assets to adequately
provide for the basic maintenance needs of him/herself as
determined by the guidelines.
4. “Relieved” means an applicant shall be assisted to meet
those basic needs.
NON-FINANCIAL ELIGIBILITY FACTORS
1. Age – General assistance cannot be denied any
applicant because of the applicant’s age; age is not a
factor in determining whether or not an applicant may
receive general assistance. Minor children are assumed
to be the responsibility of the parent(s) or legal
guardian(s) unless circumstances warrant otherwise.
2. Support Actions – No applicant or recipient shall be
compelled, as a condition of eligibility or continued
receipt of assistance, to take any legal action against any
other person. The municipality may pursue recovery
against legally liable persons or governmental units.
3. Eligibility for Other Categorical Assistance - Recipients who
are, or may be, eligible for any other form of public
assistance must apply for such assistance immediately,
but no later than 7 days after being advised to do so by
the Welfare Director. Failure to do so my render the
recipient ineligible for assistance. No person receiving
payments from Old Age Assistance (OAA) or Aid to the
Permanently and Totally Disabled (APTD), under RSA 167
or 161, shall at the same time be eligible for general
assistance, except for emergency medical assistance.
RSA167:27. Receipt of medical assistance under
Medicaid-APTD does not preclude eligibility for general
assistance.
4. Employment – An applicant who is gainfully employed,
but whose income and assets are not sufficient to meet
25
necessary household expenses, may be eligible to receive
general assistance. However, recipients who without
good cause refuse a job offer or referral to suitable
employment, participation in the Workfare program, or
who voluntarily leave a job without good cause may be
ineligible for continuing general assistance in accordance
with the procedures for suspension outlined in the
guidelines. The Welfare Director shall first determine
whether there is good cause for such refusal, taking into
account the ability and physical and mental capacity of
the applicant, transportation problems, working
conditions that might involve risks to health and safety,
lack of adequate child care, or any other factors that
might make refusing a job reasonable. These
employment requirements shall extend to all adult
members of the household.
5. Registration with the NH Department of Employment
Security (NHES) and Work Search Requirements – All
unemployed recipients and adult members of their
households shall, within 7 days after having been granted
assistance, register with NHES to find work and must
conduct a reasonable, verified job search as determined
by the Welfare Director. Each recipient must apply for
employment to each employer to whom he/she is
referred by the Welfare Director. These work search
requirements apply unless the recipient and each other
adult member of the household is:
• Gainfully employed full-time
• A dependent 18 or under who is regularly attending
secondary school
• Unable to work due to illness or mental or physical
disability of him/herself or another member of the
household, as verified by the Welfare Director or
• Is solely responsible for the care of a child under the
age of 5 (RSA 165:31, III). A recipient responsible for
the care of a child aged 5 to 12 years of age shall
not be excused from work search requirements, but
26
shall be deemed to have good cause to refuse a job
requiring work during the hours the child is not usually
in school, if there is not responsible person available
to provide care, and it is verified by the Welfare
Director that no other care is available.
The Welfare Director shall give all necessary and reasonable
assistance to ensure compliance with registration and work
requirements, including the granting of allowances for
transportation and work clothes. Failure of a recipient to
comply with these requirements without good cause will be
reason for denial of assistance.
6. Students – Applicants who are college students not
available for or refusing to seek full-time employment
are not eligible for general assistance.
7. Non-Citizens – The Welfare Director may, in his/her sole
discretion, provide limited assistance to non-citizen not
otherwise eligible for general assistance.
• A non-citizen who is not:
A qualified alien under 8 USCA 1641
• A non-immigrant under the federal Immigration and
Nationality Act or
• An alien paroled into the United States for less than
one year under 8 USCA 1182(d)(5) is not eligible for
general assistance from the municipality. 8 USCA
1621(a).
Qualified aliens include aliens who are lawfully admitted
for permanent residence under the Immigration and
Nationality Act (8USCA 1101 et seq.), aliens who are
granted asylum under that act, certain refugees, and
certain battered aliens. 8 USCA1641.
A non-citizen who is not eligible for general assistance
may be eligible for state assistance with health care items
and services that are necessary for the treatment of an
emergency medical condition, which is defined as a
medical condition (including emergency labor and
delivery) manifesting itself by acute symptoms of sufficient
27
severity (including severe pain) such that the absence of
immediate medical attention could reasonably be
expected to result in:
• Placing the patient’s health in serious jeopardy
• Serious impairment to bodily functions or
• Serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part. 8
USCA 1621(b) and 42 USCA 1396 (v)(3).
A non-citizen may also be eligible for general assistance
for treatment of an emergency medical condition.
Non-citizen applicants for general assistance may be
required to provide proof of eligibility. (8 USCA 1625).
8. Property Transfers – No applicant who is otherwise
eligible shall receive such assistance if he/she has
made an assignment, transfer, or conveyance of
property for the purpose of rendering him/herself
eligible for assistance within 3 years immediately
preceding his/her application (RSA 165:2-b).
9. Employment of Household Members – The employment
requirements of these guidelines, or participation in the
Workfare Program, shall be required for all adults aged
18 to 65 years of age residing in the same household,
except those regularly attending secondary school or
employed on a full-time basis, who are:
• Members of the recipient’s household
• Legally liable to contribute to the support of the
recipient and/or children of the household and
• Not prevented from maintaining employment and
contributing to the support of the household by
reason of physical or mental disability or other
justifiable cause as verified by the Welfare
Director.
The Welfare Director may waive this requirement where
failure of the other household members to comply is not
the fault of the recipient and the Welfare Director decides
28
it would be unreasonable for the recipient to establish a
separate household. (RSA 165:32).
10. Disqualification for Voluntary Termination of
Employment – Any applicant eligible for assistance
who voluntarily terminated employment shall be
ineligible to receive assistance for 90 days from the
date of employment termination provided the
applicant:
• Has received local welfare within the past 365
days and
• Has been given notice that voluntary
termination of employment without good
cause could result in disqualification and
• Has terminated employment of at least 20
hours per week without good cause within 60
days of an application for local welfare and
• Is not responsible for supporting minor children
in his/her household and
• Did not have a mental or physical impairment
which caused him/her to be unable to work.
Good cause for terminating employment shall include any of
the following:
• Discrimination
• Unreasonable work demands
• Unsuitable employment
• Retirement
• Leaving a job to accept a bona-fide job offer
• Migrant farm labor
• Seasonal construction
• Lack of transportation
• Lack of child care
An applicant shall be considered to have voluntarily
terminated employment if the applicant fails to report to work
without good cause. An applicant who is fired or resigns from a
job at the request of the employer due to applicant’s inability
to maintain the employer’s normal work productivity standard
29
shall not be considered to have voluntarily terminated
employment. (RSA 165:1-d)
AVAILABLE ASSETS
1. Available Liquid Assets – Cash on hand, bank deposits,
credit union accounts, securities and retirement plans (i.e.
IRAs, deferred compensation, Keogh’s, etc.) are available
liquid assets. Insurance policies with a loan value, and
non-essential personal property, may be considered as
available liquid assets when they have been converted
into cash. The Welfare Director shall allow a reasonable
time for such conversion. However, tools of a trade,
livestock and farm equipment, and necessary and
ordinary household goods are essential items of personal
property which shall not be considered as available
assets.
2. Automobile Ownership – The ownership of an automobile
by an applicant/recipient or his/her dependent does not
affect eligibility if it is essential for transportation to seek or
maintain employment, to procure medical services or
rehabilitation services, or if its use is essential to the
maintenance of the individual or the family.
3. Insurance – The ownership of insurance policies does not
affect eligibility. However, when a policy has cash or loan
value, the recipient will be required to obtain and/or
borrow all available funds, which shall then be considered
available liquid assets.
4. Real Estate – The type and amount of real estate owned
by an applicant does not affect eligibility, although rent
or other such income from property shall be considered
as available to meet need. Applicants owning real estate
property, other than that occupied as their primary
residence, shall be expected to make reasonable efforts
to dispose of it at fair market value. Applicants shall be
informed that a lien covering the amount of any general
30
assistance they receive shall be placed against any real
estate they own. RSA 165:28.
INCOME
In determining eligibility and the amount of assistance, the
standard of need shall be compared to the available
income/assets. Computation of income and expenses will be
the week or month. The following items will be included in the
computation:
• Earned income – Income in cash or in-kind earned by the
applicant or any member of the household through
wages, salary, commissions, or profit, whether selfemployed
or as an employee, is to be included as
income. With respect to self-employment, total profit is
arrived at by subtracting business expenses from gross
income in accordance with standard accounting
principles. When income consists of wages, the amount
computed should be that available after income taxes,
social security and other payroll deductions required by
state, federal, or local law, court-ordered support
payments and child care costs, and work related clothing
costs have been deducted from income. Wages that are
trusted, or income similarly unavailable to the applicant or
applicant’s dependents should not be included.
• Income or Support from Other Persons – Contributions
from relatives or other household members shall be
considered as income only if actually available and
received by the applicant or recipient. The income of
non-household members of the applicant’s residential unit
shall not be counted as income.
• Income from Other Assistance or Social Insurance
Programs -
1. State categorical assistance benefits (OASDI)
payments, Social Security Payments, VA benefits,
unemployment insurance benefits and payment
31
from other government sources shall be
considered income.
2. Food Stamps cannot be counted as income
pursuant to federal law. 7 USC 2017(b)
3. Fuel Assistance cannot be counted as income
pursuant to federal law. 42 USC 8624(f)(1).
• Court Ordered Support Payments – Alimony and child
support payments shall be considered income only if
actually received by the applicant or recipient.
• Income from Other Sources – Payment from pension, trust
funds, and similar programs shall be considered income.
• Earning of a Child – No inquiry shall be made into the
earnings of a child 14 years of age or less unless that child
makes a regular and substantial contribution to the family.
• Option to Treat A Qualified State Assistance Reduction as
Deemed Income – The Welfare Director may deem as
income all or any portion of any qualified state assistance
reduction pursuant to RSA 167:82, VIII. The following
criteria shall apply to any action to deem income under
this section. RSA 165:1-e.
1. The authority to deem income under this section
shall terminate when the Qualified State Assistance
Reduction no longer is in effect.
2. Applicants for general assistance may be required
to cooperate in obtaining from the Department of
Health and Human Services as to the existence and
amount of any Qualified State Assistance Reduction.
No applicant for general assistance may be
considered to be subject to a Qualified State
Assistance Reduction unless the existence and
amount has been confirmed by the Department of
Health and Human Services.
3. The Welfare Director shall provide the applicant with
a written decision which sets forth the amount of any
deemed income used to determine eligibility for
general assistance.
32
4. Whenever necessary to prevent an immediate
threat to the health and safety of children in the
household, the Welfare Director shall waive that
portion, if any, of the Qualified State Assistance
Reduction as necessary.
RESIDENTS OF SHELTERS FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC
VIOLENCE AND THEIR CHILDEN
An applicant residing in a shelter for victims of domestic
violence and their children who has income, and owns
resources jointly with the abusive member of the applicant’s
household, shall be required to cooperate with the normal
procedures of verification. Such resources and income may be
excluded from eligibility determinations unless the applicant
has safe access to joint resources at the time of application.
The verification process may be completed through an
authorized representative of the shelter of residence. The
normal procedures taken in accordance with these guidelines
to recover assistance granted shall not delay such assistance.
ON-GOING ASSISTANCE
The local welfare obligation has no limit in time or amount. If an
applicant remains eligible, and complies with properly imposed
conditions, the duty to assist is indefinite. If an applicant is
receiving on-going assistance, an emergency situation may
temporarily change the assistances provided. In these
instances, it is important to document the change in assistance
provided.
WELFARE BUDGET
The local welfare obligation has no limit in time or amount. This
means that if a person is eligible for assistance because he/she
is found to be “poor and unable to support him/herself/, then
33
he/she must be assisted by the municipality, even if the budget
for welfare has been exhausted. The governing body should
be kept aware of the balance in the welfare budget, so they
can take timely action to transfer additional appropriations into
the welfare budget to avoid overspending.
34
STANDARD OF NEED
35
The basic financial requirement for general assistance is that an
applicant be poor and unable to support him/herself. An
applicant shall be considered poor when he/she has
insufficient available income/assets to purchase either for
him/herself or dependents any of the following:
SHELTER
The amount to included as “need” for shelter is the actual cost
of rent or mortgage necessary to provide shelter in that
municipality. That cost shall be determined by the governing
body and the welfare director.
• Shelter Arrearages – Shelter arrearages will be included in
the “need” formula, if, and only if, such payment is
necessary to prevent eviction or foreclosure or to protect
the health and safety of the household. However, if the
amount of such mortgage or rental arrearage
substantially exceeds the cost of alternative, available
housing which complies with local health and housing
code standards, or if the payment of arrears will not
prevent eviction or foreclosure, the Welfare Director may
instead authorize payment of security deposit, rent,
and/or reasonable relocation expenses for such
alternative housing, if, under the circumstances of the
case, it is reasonable to do so and would not cause
undue hardship to the applicant household. Alternative
housing may include transitional housing as an option.
Should alternative housing be the only and immediate
means of solving a homeless or near homeless situation
and is offered and ultimately refused by the applicant,
the Welfare Director shall note said offer and the
applicant shall be considered ineligible for further
assistance.
An applicant seeking assistance with moving to another
dwelling must document that the reason for the move is:
36
• Substandard housing – documented by the appropriate
public official
• Homelessness as defined as on the street and nowhere to
go
• Imminent eviction which was unavoidable by the
applicant
• The unavailability of any alternative housing (anywhere in
the state).
As the Town of Bristol is a member of the Local Welfare
Administrators Association, an affiliate organization of the
Municipal Association of the Local Government Center, the
Town of Bristol shall not relocate any applicant/s in another
community unless the following conditions exist:
• The applicant/s is gainfully employed or starting a
full-time job in that community
• The applicant/s have other services in place and will
not be a burden to the new community
• The applicant/s have exhausted all reasonable
efforts and have not been able to find a landlord in
the area who will rent to them
• The move will place the applicant/s nearer to their
place of employment, medical, or psychological
service providers
• There is not available alternative housing open to
the applicant/s.
The Town of Bristol shall not relocate an applicant into any
dwelling situation that they cannot afford to maintain after the
initial relocation assistance, nor continue to keep an applicant
in a dwelling unit that is unaffordable to an applicant under
normal financial circumstances.
Security Deposits – Security deposits may be included in the
“need” formula if, and on if, the applicant is unable to secure
alternative shelter for which no security deposit is required or is
unable to secure funds, either him/herself or from alternative
37
sources, for payment of the deposit. Any security deposit
provided by the general assistance program which is returned
under RSA 540-A:7 shall be returned to the municipality, not the
recipient.
Housing Inspections – Rent shall not be paid on any dwelling
unit that does not meet the minimum housing criteria as set
forth by the Bristol Health Officer (RSA 48:A) and the Bristol Fire
Department (Life Safety 101). The Welfare Director shall not
pay rent on any dwelling that has not passed an inspection by
the Bristol Health Officer and the Bristol Fire Department within
the last 12 months, and for a dwelling to be eligible for rental
assistance payments, it must have no unresolved and/or
outstanding complaints against it with either the Health Office
or the Fire Department.
If both inspections cannot be done at the same time and the
dwelling being considered for rental assistance has passed one
of the two inspections, rent will be issued so long as the first
inspector feels there are no issues. If the second inspection
does uncover issues that are in violation of RSA 48:A or Life
Safety 101, rental payments shall cease until such time as the
necessary repairs and/or alterations to the dwelling are
completed. Verification of such completion shall be
accomplished by a second inspection/s.
Should a client continue to be eligible for rental assistance and
landlord/owner are actively addressing the repairs and/or
alterations necessary to become compliant with RSA 48:A and
Life Safety 101, vouchers may be pended. Said vouchers shall
be released for payment only when the dwelling is in
compliance with both RSA 48:A and Life Safety 101. If the
landlord/owner refuses to make said repairs and/or alterations
for the existing tenant eligible for rental assistance, any rent
payments that may have been pended shall be held to be null
and void.
38
If the landlord refuses to make the necessary alterations and/or
repairs within the specified length of time (usually 30 days from
the receipt of a certified letter sent for the Welfare Director
noting the inspection/s and the issues that are not in
compliance) the Welfare Director shall inform the Health
Director and/or the Fire Department and request that they go
forward with the necessary legal action to insurance
compliance and/or take appropriate action to condemn the
building until such time as it meets the minimum standards set
forth in the statutes.
Relative landlords – Whenever a relative of an applicant is also
the landlord for the applicant, a financial analysis shall be
made in accordance with RSA 165:19.
UTILITIES
When utility costs are not included in the shelter expense, the
most recent monthly utility bill will be included as part of “need”
by the Welfare Director. Arrearages will not normally be
included in “need” except as set for below.
NOTE: The New Hampshire Public Utilities Commission (PUC) has
established comprehensive rules governing the provisions of
some utility services. Generally speaking, the PUC governs
electric, telephone, water, and sewer; it does not govern any
municipal utilities, propane, tanks, or fuel oil. With the
exception of telephone, the rules are consistent across utilities.
These rules and regulations cover the initiation of service,
payment arrangements, termination of service, the terms or
restoration of service, the requirement of deposits, municipal
guarantees and guarantees from other third parties. There are
special rules as to winter termination. The Welfare Director
should be familiar with these rules in order to ensure that needs
are properly met at the lowest available cost. The PUC has a
toll-free consumer assistance number: 1-800-852-3793.
39
Arrearages – Arrearages will not be included except when
necessary to ensure the health and safety of the applicant
household to prevent termination of utility service where no
other resources or referrals can be utilized. In accordance with
the rules of the PUC relating to electric utilities, arrearages for
electric service need not be paid if the Welfare Director notifies
the electric company that the municipality guarantees
payment of current electric bills as long as the recipient
remains eligible for general assistance.
Restoration of Service – When utility service has been
terminated and the Welfare Director has determined that
alternative utility service is not available and alternative shelter
is not feasible; arrearages will be included in “need” when
restoration of service is necessary to ensure the health and
safety of the applicant household. The Welfare Director may
negotiate with the utility for payment of less than the full
amount of the arrears and/or may attempt to arrange a
repayment plan to obtain restoration of service.
When electric service has been terminated and restoration is
required, arrearages may either be included as set forth in the
above paragraph, or may be paid in accordance with a
reasonable payment plan entered into by the applicant and
the electric company. The Welfare Director may hold the
recipient accountable for the payment arrangement for as
long as the recipient continues to request general assistance
on a regular basis. Payment of a payment plan may be a
required element of a Notice of Decision or case plan.
Deposits – Utility security deposits will be considered as “need”
if, and only if, the applicant is unable to secure utility service
without a deposit. Such deposits shall, however, be the
property of the municipality.
• Any utility bill in the name of someone other than the
adult applicant/s will not be considered for payment.
40
• The Welfare Director shall require the applicant/s to within
7 days of contact with the office make an appointment
with the local CAP office for the electric discount program
and/or fuel assistance. If the applicant/s fail to attend the
original scheduled appointment and/or complete the
application process for the electric discount and/or fuel
assistance, they will be considered non-compliant and
shall be sanctioned for 7 days or until such time they
complete application process.
FOOD
The amount included as “need” for food purchases will be in
accordance with the most recent standard food stamp
allotment, as determined under the food stamp program
administered by the New Hampshire Department of Health
and Human Services. An amount in excess in the standard
food allotment may be granted if one or more members of
the household needs a special diet, as verified by the
Welfare Director, the documented cost of which is greater
than can be purchased with the family’s allotment of food
stamps. Food vouchers may not be used for alcohol,
tobacco, or pet food.
HOUSEHOLD MAINTENANCE ALLOWANCE
Applicants may include, in calculating “need”, the cost of
providing personal and household necessities in an amount
not to exceed these guidelines. Need allowance for diapers
shall be calculated based on usage.
TELEPHONE
If the absence of a telephone would create an
unreasonable risk to the applicant’s health or safety (as
verified by the Welfare Director), or for other good cause as
determined by the Welfare Director, the lowest available
41
basic monthly rate will be budgeted as “need”. While
payments will not be made for telephone bills, under
exceptional circumstances where no other source of
assistance is available, payments may be made to maintain
basic telephone service.
TRANSPORTATION
If the Welfare Director determines that transportation is
necessary (e.g. for health or medical reasons, to maintain
employment, or to comply with conditions of assistance)
“need” should include the costs of public transportation,
where available. If, and only if, the transportation need
cannot be reasonably provided by alternative means, such
as public transportation or volunteer drivers, a reasonable
amount for car payments and gasoline should be included
as part of “need” when determining eligibility or amount of
aid.
MAINTENANCE OF INSURANCE
In the event that the Welfare Director determines that the
maintenance of medical insurance is essential, an applicant
may include as “need” the reasonable cost of such
premiums.
EMERGENCY AND OTHER EXPENSES
In the event that the applicant has the following expenses,
the actual cost shall be included as emergency and other
expenses to determine eligibility and amount of assistance.
• Medical Expenses – The Welfare Director shall not
consider including amounts for medical, dental, or eye
services unless the applicant can verify that all other
potential sources have been investigated and that
there is no source of assistance other than local
welfare. Other sources to be considered shall include
42
state and federal programs, local and area clinics,
area service organizations, and area hospital indigent
programs designed for such needs. When an
applicant requests medical services, prescriptions,
dental service or eye service, the Welfare Director may
require verification from a doctor, dentist, or person
licensed to practice optometry in the area, indicating
that these services are absolutely necessary and
cannot be postponed without creating a significant risk
that the applicant’s well-being will be placed in serious
jeopardy. To be eligible for assistance for prescriptions,
a client must have the Town of Bristol Controlled
Substance Statement completed by the physician
before the Welfare Director can authorize payment for
said prescription. The Town of Bristol shall not replace
any “lost or stolen” prescriptions and shall only authorize
payment for other than the generic version of a
prescription, if one is available.
The Town of Bristol shall not pay for any medical
prescriptions for sexual performance drugs i.e. Viagra,
Cialis, etc.
LEGAL EXPENSES
Except for those specifically required by statute, no legal
expenses will be included.
CLOTHING
If the applicant has an emergency clothing need which
cannot be met in a timely fashion by other community
resources (Salvation Army, Red Cross, church groups, etc.), the
expense of reasonable meeting that emergency clothing need
will be included.
43
UNUSUAL NEEDS
If the Welfare Director determines that the strict application of
the standard of need criteria will result in unnecessary hardship
(needed services are inaccessible to the applicant), the
Director may make minor adjustments in the criteria, or may
make allowances using the emergency need standards of
these guidelines. Any such determination and the reasons,
therefore, shall be stated in writing in the applicant’s case
record.
SHARED EXPENSES
If the applicant/recipient household shares shelter, utility, or
other expenses with a non-applicant/recipient (is part of a
residential unit), then need should be determined on a pro-rata
share based on the total number of adults in the residential unit
(e.g. three adults in a residential unit, but only applies for
assistance – shelter need is 1/3 of shelter allowance for a
household of three adults).
PAYMENT LEVELS FOR ALLOWABLE EXPENSES
When adopting these guidelines, the municipal governing
body shall establish payment levels for various allowable
expenses which shall be based on actual local market
conditions and costs. The payment levels shall be reviewed by
the Welfare Director annually and modifications presented by
the municipal governing body when market conditions have
changed. RSA 165:1 II
44
NON-RESIDENTS
45
ELIGIBILITY
Applicants who are temporarily in a municipality which is not
their municipality of residence and who do not intend to make
a residence there are nonetheless eligible to receive general
assistance, provided they are poor and unable to support
themselves (RSA 165:1-c). No applicant shall be refused solely
on the basis of residence (RSA 165:1).
STANDARDS
The applicant procedure, eligibility standards and standard of
need shall be the same for non-residents as for resident.
VERIFICATION
Verification records shall not be considered unavailable, nor
the applicant’s responsibility for providing such records relaxed,
solely because they are located in the applicant’s municipality
of residence.
TEMPORARY OR EMERGENCY AID
The standards for the fulfilling of immediate or emergency
needs of non-residents and for temporary assistance pending
final decision shall be the same as for residents.
DETERMINATION OF RESIDENCE
Determination of residence shall be made if the applicant
requests return home transportation, or if the Welfare Director
has reason to believe the applicant is a resident of another
New Hampshire municipality from which recovery can be
made under RSA 165:20.
Minors – The residence of a minor applicant shall be presumed
to be the residence of his/her custodial parent or guardian.
46
Adults – For competent adults, the standard for determining
residence shall be the overall intent of the applicant, as set
forth in the definition of “residence”. The statement of an
applicant over 18 years of age as to his/her residence or intent
to establish residence shall be accepted in the absence of
strongly inconsistent evidence or behavior.
RETURN HOME TRANSPORTATION
At the request of a non-resident applicant, any aid temporary
or otherwise to which he/she would be otherwise entitled under
the standards set forth in these guidelines, may be used by the
Welfare Director to cause the applicant to be returned to
his/her municipality of residence. (RSA 165:1-c)
RECOVERY
Any aid given to a non-resident, including the costs of return
home transportation, may be recovered from his/her
municipality of residence.
47
MUNICIPAL WORK PROGRAMS (WORKFARE)
48
PARTICIPATION
Any recipient of general assistance who is able and not
gainfully employed may be required to work for the
municipality or an appropriate local human service agency at
any available bona fide job which is within his/her capacity
(RSA 165:31) for the purpose of reimbursement of benefits
received. Participants in the Workfare Program are not
considered employees of the municipality, and any work
performed by Workfare participants does not give rise to any
employer-employee relationship between the
recipient/Workfare participant and the municipality.
REIMBURSEMENT RATE
The Workfare participant shall be allotted the prevailing
municipal wage for work performed, but in no case less than
the minimum wage. No cash compensation shall be paid for
Workfare participation; the wage value of all hours worked shall
be used to reimburse the municipality for assistance given. No
Workfare participant shall be required to work more hours than
necessary to reimburse aid rendered.
CONTINUING FINANCIAL LIABILITY
If, due to lack of municipal work or other good cause, a
recipient does not work a sufficient number of hours to fully
reimburse the municipality for the amount of his/her aid, the
amount of aid received less the value of Workfare hours
completed shall still be owed to the municipality.
ALLOWANCE FOR WORK SEARCH
The municipality shall provide reasonable time during working
hours for the Workfare participant to conduct a documented
employment search.
49
WORKFARE PROGRAM ATTENDANCE
With prior notice to the Welfare Director, a recipient may be
excused from Workfare participant if he/she:
• Has a conflicting job interview
• Has a conflicting interview at a service or welfare
agency
• Has a medical appointment or illness
• As a parent or person “in loco parentis”, must care for a
child under the age of 5 years of age. A recipient
responsible for a child age 5 but under the age of 12
shall not be required to work during hours the child is
not in school, if there is no responsible person available
to provide care, and no other care is available
• Is unable to work due to mental or physical disability, as
verified by the Welfare Director
• Must remain home because of illness or disability to
another member of the household, as verified by the
Welfare Director
• Does not possess the materials or tools required to
perform the task and the municipality fails to provide
them. However, the Workfare participant should
attempt to schedule appointments so as not to conflict
with the Workfare Program and must notify his/her
supervisor in advance of the appointment. The Welfare
Director may require participants to provide
documentation of their attendance at a conflicting
interview or appointment.
WORKFARE HOURS
Workfare hours are subject approval of the supervisor and the
Welfare Director. Failure of the participant to adhere to the
agreed Workfare hours (except for the reasons listed above)
will prompt review of the recipient’s eligibility for general
assistance, and may result in a suspension or termination of
assistance.
50
WORKERS COMPENSATION
Workers Compensation is not applicable to participants in
Workfare Programs in the Town of Bristol. (RSA 281-A-2, VII(b).
(Adopted by the Town of Bristol September 11, 2011)
51
BURIALS AND CREMATIONS
52
The Welfare Director shall provide for proper burial or cremation
at municipal expense, of persons found in the municipality at
the time of death, regardless of whether the deceased person
ever applied for or received general assistance from any
municipality. In such cases, assistance may be applied for on
behalf of the deceased person, however, the application
should be made before any burial or cremation expenses are
incurred. The expense may be recovered from the deceased
person’s municipality of residence, or from a liable relative
pursuant to RSA 165:3, II. If relative, other private persons, the
state or other sources are unable to cover the entire
burial/cremation expense, the municipality will pay up to $750
for burial cremation. (RSA 165:3 and RSA 165:1-b. See also RSA
165:27 and 165:27-a).
The Welfare Director does require the following prior to
payment:
• Proof of residence in the Town of Bristol of the
deceased (length of time and location).
• Copy of the bill from the funeral home.
• Copy of all bank accounts/statements.
• Verification of income and assets for the deceased
and the applicant.
• Copy of the death certificate.
• Copy of Probate Court orders – appointment of an
executor of estate.
• Family members must provide a sworn, notarized
statement they cannot assist financially with
expenses. The sworn statement MUST be notarized
by a Notary Public or Justice of the Peace. (Family
members include: spouses, parents, siblings, and/or
significant others).
53
RIGHT TO NOTICE OF ADVERSE ACTION
54
RIGHT TO A WRITTEN DECISION
All persons have a constitutional right to be free of unfair,
arbitrary or unreasonable action taken by government. This
includes applicants for and recipients of general assistance,
whose aid has been denied, terminated or reduced. Every
applicant and recipient shall be given a notice of every
decision regarding assistance. The Welfare Director will make
every effort to ensure that the applicant understands the
decision.
ACTION TAKEN FOR REASONS OTHER THAN NON-COMPLIANCE
WITH THE GUIDELINES
Whenever a decision is made to deny assistance or to refuse to
grant the full amount of assistance required, a Notice of
Decision shall be given or mailed to the applicant either the
same day or next work day following the making of the
decision or within 5 working days from the time the application
is filled out and submitted, whichever comes first.
In any case where the Welfare Director decides to terminate or
reduce assistance for reasons other than non-compliance with
the guidelines, the Director shall send notice at least 7 days in
advance of the effective date of the decision to the recipient
stating the intended action.
The notice required by paragraphs 1 and 2 above shall
contain:
• A clear statement of the reasons for the denial or
proposed termination or reduction.
• A statement advising the recipient of his/her right to a fair
hearing and that any request for a fair hearing must be
made in writing within 5 working days.
• A form on which the recipient may request a fair hearing.
• A statement advising the recipient of the time limits which
must be met in order to receive a fair hearing.
55
• A statement that assistance may continue, if there was
initial eligibility, until the date of hearing, if requested by
the claimant. Aid must be repaid if the claimant fails to
prevail at the hearing.
SUSPENSION FOR NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE GUIDELINES
NOTE: This procedure has been developed by the Local
Government Center (LGC) in an effort to set forth a clear
process for suspension of assistance for willful non-compliance
with guidelines, under RSA 165:1-b. There are differing opinions
as to the specific procedures required by the statute. The
procedures outlined in this section are not specifically
mandated by RSA 165:1-b, but are the LGC’s attempt to
create a legally sound compromise.
DUE PROCESS
Recipients must comply with these guidelines and the
reasonable requests of the Welfare Director. The Welfare
Director must enforce the guidelines while ensuring that all
recipients and applicants receive due process. Recipients
should be given reasonable notice of the conditions and
requirements of eligibility and continuing eligibility and notice
that non-compliance may result in termination or suspension.
CONDITIONS
Any applicant/recipient otherwise eligible for assistance shall
become ineligible under RSA 165:1-b if he/she willfully and
without good cause fails to comply with the requirements of
these guidelines relating to the obligation to:
• Disclose and provide verification of income, resources, or
other material financial data, including any changes in
this information.
• Participate in the Workfare Program to the extent
assigned by the Welfare Director.
56
• Comply with the work search requirements imposed by
the Welfare Director and
• Apply for other public assistance, as required by the
Welfare Director.
FIRST NOTICE
No recipient otherwise eligible shall be suspended for noncompliance
with conditions unless he/she has been given a
written notice of the actions required in order to remain eligible
and a seven-day period within which to comply. The first
notice should be given at the time of the Notice of Decision
and thereafter as conditions change. Additional notice of
actions required should also be given, as eligibility is redetermined,
but without an additional seven-day period unless
new actions are required. (RSA 165:1-b,II).
NON-COMPLIANCE
If a recipient willfully and without good cause fails to come into
compliance during the seven-day period, or willfully falls into
non-compliance within 30 days from receipt of a first notice,
the Welfare Director shall give the recipient a suspension
notice.
If a recipient falls into non-compliance for the first time more
than 30 days after receipt of a first notice, the Welfare Director
shall give the recipient a new first notice with a new seven-day
period to comply before giving the recipient the suspension
notice. (RSA 165:1-b, III).
SUSPENSION NOTICE
Written notice to a recipient that he/she is suspended from
assistance due to failure to comply with the conditions required
in a first notice shall include:
57
• A list of the guidelines with which the recipient is not in
compliance and a description of those actions necessary
for compliance.
• The period of suspension
• Notice of the right to a fair hearing on the issue of willful
non-compliance and that such request must be made in
writing within 5 days of receipt of the suspension notice.
• A statement that assistance may continue in accordance
with the prior eligibility determination until the fair hearing
decision is made if the recipient so requests on the request
form for the fair hearing; however, if the recipient fails to
prevail at the hearing – a. the suspension will start after the
decision and b. such aid must be repaid by the recipient
and
• A form on which the individual may request a fair hearing
and the continuance of assistance pending the outcome.
SUSPENSION PERIOD
The suspension period for failure to comply with these
guidelines shall last:
• Either 7 days or 14 days if the recipient has had a prior
suspension which ended within the past 6 months, and
• Until the recipient complies with the guidelines if the
recipient, upon the expiration of the 7 or 14 day
suspension, continues to fail to carry out the specific
actions set forth in the notice.
• Notwithstanding the above, a recipient who has been
suspended for non-compliance for at least 6 months may
file a new application for assistance without coming back
into compliance.
FAIR HEARING ON CONTINUING NON-COMPLIANCE
A recipient who has been suspended until he/she complies
with the guidelines may request a fair hearing to resolve a
dispute over whether or not he/she has satisfactorily complied
58
with the required guidelines; however, no assistance shall be
available.
COMPLIANCE AFTER SUSPENSION
A recipient who has been subject to a suspension and who has
come back into compliance shall have his/her assistance
resumed, provided he/she is still otherwise eligible. The Notice
of Decision stating that assistance has been resumed should
again set forth the actions required to remain eligible for
assistance, but need not provide a 7 day period for
compliance unless new conditions have been imposed.
59
FAIR HEARINGS
60
REQUESTS
A request for a fair hearing is a written expression, by the
applicant or recipient, or any person acting for him/her, to the
effect that he/she wants an opportunity to present his/her case
to a higher authority. When a request for assistance is denied
or when an applicant desires to challenge a decision made by
the Welfare Director relative to the receipt of assistance, the
applicant must present a request for a fair hearing to the
Welfare Director within 5 working days of receipt of the Notice
of Decision at issue. RSA 165:1-b, III
TIME LIMITS FOR HEARINGS
Hearings requested by claimants must be held within 7 working
days of the receipt of the request. The Welfare Director shall
give notice to the claimant setting the time and location of the
hearing. This notice must be given to the claimant at 48 hours
in advance of the hearing, or mailed to the claimant at least 72
hours in advance of the hearing.
THE FAIR HEARING OFFICER(S)
The Fair Hearing officer or officers may be chosen by the Town
Administrator, the Administrative/Executive Assistant of the
Board of Selectmen or the Chairman of the Board of
Selectmen. The person(s) serving as the Fair Hearing authority
must:
• Not have participated in the decision causing
dissatisfaction.
• Be impartial.
• Be sufficiently skilled in interviewing to be able to obtain
evidence and facts necessary for a fair determination.
• Be capable of evaluating all evidence fairly and
realistically, to explain to the claimant the laws and
regulations under which the Welfare Director operated,
and to interpret to the Welfare Director any evidence of
61
unsound, unclear, or inequitable policies, practices, or
action.
FAIR HEARING PROCEDURES
1. All Fair Hearings shall be conducted in such a manner as
to ensure due process of law. Fair Hearings shall not be
conducted according to strict rules of evidence. The
burden of proof shall be on the claimant, who shall be
required to establish his/her case by a preponderance of
the evidence.
2. The Welfare Director responsible for the disputed decision
shall attend the hearing and testify about his/her actions
and the reasons therefore.
3. Both parties shall be given the opportunity to offer
evidence and explain their positions as fully and
completely as they wish. The claimant shall have the
opportunity to present his/her case or, at the claimant’s
option, with the aid of others, and to bring witnesses, to
establish all pertinent facts, to advance any arguments
without undue interference, to question or refute
testimony or evidence, including the opportunity to
confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses.
4. A claimant or his/her duly authorized representative has
the right to examine, prior to a fair hearing, papers and
documents from the claimant’s case file which either
party may wish to introduce at the fair hearing, as well as
any available documents not contained in the case file
but relevant to the Welfare Director’s action of which the
claimant complains. The claimant may introduce any
such documents, papers, or records into evidence. No
record, paper or document, which the claimant has
requested to review but has not been allowed to examine
prior to the hearing, shall be introduced at the hearing or
become part of the record.
5. The Welfare Director (or a duly authorized representative)
shall have the right to examine at the Fair Hearing all
62
documents on which the claimant plans to rely at the Fair
Hearing and may request a 24-hour continuance if such
documents contain evidence not previously provided or
disclosed by the claimant. Should the applicant have a
new documentation relevant to the disputed decision,
he/she may re-apply for assistance and file a written
withdrawal of the Fair Hearing request.
6. The decision of the Fair Hearing officer(s) must be based
solely on the record, in light of these guidelines. Evidence,
both written and oral, which is admitted at the hearing,
shall be the sole contents of the record. The Fair Hearing
officer shall not review the case record or other materials
prior to introduction at the hearing.
7. The parties may stipulate to any facts.
8. All Fair Hearings may be tape-recorded and retained for 6
months.
DECISIONS
1. Fair Hearing decisions shall be rendered within 7 working
days of the hearing. Decisions shall be writing setting forth
the reasons for the decision and the facts on which the
Fair Hearing officer(s) relied in reaching the decision. A
copy of the decision shall be mailed or delivered to the
claimant and to the Welfare Director.
2. Fair Hearing decisions will be rendered on the basis of the
officer(s) finding of fact, these guidelines, and state and
federal law. The Fair Hearing decision shall set forth
appropriate relief.
3. The decision shall be dated. In the case of a hearing to
review denial of aid, the decision is retroactive to the
date of the action being appealed. If a claimant fails to
prevail at the hearing, the assistance given pending the
hearing shall be a debt owed by the individual to the
municipality.
4. The Welfare Director shall keep all Fair Hearing decisions
on file in chronological order.
63
5. None of the procedures specified herein shall limit any
right of the applicant or recipient to subsequent court
action to review or challenge the adverse decision.
64
LIENS
65
REAL ESTATE
The law requires the municipality to place a lien for welfare aid
received on any real estate owned by an assisted person in all
cases except for just cause. (This section does not authorize the
placement of a lien on the real estate of legally liable relatives
as defined by RSA 165:19).
The Board of Selectmen shall file a Notice of Lien with the
County Registry of Deeds, complete with the owner’s name
and a description of the property sufficient to identify it.
Interest at the rate of 6% per year shall be charged on the
amount of money constituting the lien commencing one year
after the date the lien is filed, unless waived by the municipality.
The lien remains in effect until enforced or released or until the
amount of the lien is repaid to the municipality.
The lien shall not be enforced so long as the real estate is
occupied as the sole residence of the assisted person, his/her
surviving spouse, or his/her surviving children under the age of
18, or blind, or permanently and totally disabled. At such time
as the lien may become enforceable, the Welfare Director shall
attempt to contact the attorney handling the real estate or
estate before enforcing the lien. Upon repayment of a lien, the
municipality must file a written notice of the discharge of the
lien with the County Registry of Deeds. RSA 165:28
CIVIL JUDGEMENTS – RSA 165:28-a
1. A municipality shall be entitled to a lien upon property
passing under the terms of a will or by intestate
succession, a property settlement, or a civil judgment for
personal injuries (except for Workers Compensation)
awarded any person granted assistance by the
municipality for the amount of assistance granted by the
municipality.
66
2. The municipality shall be entitled to the lien only if the
assistance was granted no more than 6 years before the
receipt of the inheritance or the award of the property
settlement or civil judgment. When the Welfare Director
becomes aware of such a claim against a civil judgment,
he/she shall contact the attorney representing the
recipient.
3. The lien shall take precedence over all other claims.
67
RECOVERY OF ASSISTANCE
68
The Welfare Director shall seek to recover money expended to
assist eligible applicants. There shall be no delay, refusal to
assist, reduction or termination of assistance while the Welfare
Director is pursuing procedural or statutory avenues to secure
reimbursement. Any legal action to recover must be filed in a
court within 6 years after the expenditure. RSA 165:25
RECOVERY FROM RESPONSIBLE RELATIVES
The amount of money spent by a municipality to assist a
recipient who has a father, mother, step-father, step-mother,
wife or child (who is no longer a minor) of sufficient ability to
also support the recipient, may be recovered from the liable
relative. Sufficient ability shall be deemed to exist when the
relative’s weekly income is more than sufficient to provide a
reasonable subsistence compatible with decency and health.
The Welfare Director may determine that “in kind” assistance or
the provision of products/services to the client is acceptable as
a relative’s response to liability for support. Written notice of
money spent in support of a recipient must be given to the
liable relative. The Welfare Director shall make reasonable
efforts to give such written notice prior to the giving of aid, but
aid to which an applicant is entitled under these guidelines,
shall not be delayed due to inability to contact possible liable
relatives. RSA 165:19
RECOVERY FROM THE MUNICIPALITY OF RESIDENCE
The Welfare Director shall seek to recover from the municipality
of residence the amount of money spent by the municipality to
assist a recipient who has a residence in another municipality.
Written notice of money spent in support of a recipient must be
given to the Welfare Director of the municipality of residence.
In any civil action for recovery under RSA 165:20, the court shall
award costs to the prevailing party. RSA 165:19 and 20. (See
RSA 165:20-a providing for arbitration of such disputes between
communities.) RSA 165:20
69
RECOVERY FROM FORMER RECIPIENT’S INCOME
A former recipient who is returned to income status after
receiving assistance may be required to reimburse the
municipality for the assistance provided, if such reimbursement
can be made without financial hardship. RSA 165:20-b
RECOVERY FROM STATE AND FEDERAL SOURCES
The amount of money spent by a municipality to support a
recipient who has made initial application of SSI and has signed
HHS FORM 151 “AUTHORIZATION FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF
INTERIM ASSISTANCE” shall be recovered through the SSA and
the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human
Services. Prescription expenses paid by the municipality for
applicants who have applied for Medicaid shall be recovered
through the New Hampshire Department of Health and Human
Services if and when the applicant is approved for medical
coverage.
DELAYED STATE CLAIMS
For those recipients of general assistance deemed eligible for
state assistance, New Hampshire Department of Health and
Human Services shall reimburse a municipality the amount of
general assistance as a result of delays in processing within the
federally mandated time periods. Any claims for
reimbursement shall be held until the end of the fiscal year and
may be reimbursed on a pro-rated basis dependent upon the
total claims filed per year. RSA 165:20-c. Form 340 “REQUEST
FOR STATE REIMBURSEMENT” may be obtained from the New
Hampshire Department of Health and Human Services for the
purpose.
70
APPLICATION OF RENTS PAID BY THE MUNICIPALITY
71
Whenever the owner of a property rented to a person
receiving general assistance from the municipality is in arrears
in sewer, water, electricity, or tax payments to the municipality,
the municipality may apply the assistance which the property
owner would have received in payment of rent on behalf of
such assisted person to the property owner’s delinquent
balances, regardless of whether such delinquent balances are
in respect of property occupied by the assisted person. RSA
165:4-a
PAYMENT ARREARS
A payment shall be considered in arrears if more than 30 days
have elapsed since the mailing of the bill, or in the case of real
estate taxes, if interest has begun to accrue pursuant to RSA
76:13. RSA 165:4-a
ORDER OF PRIORITY
Delinquent balances will be offset in order of the following
priority:
• Taxes
• Sewer/Water
PROCEDURE
1. The Welfare Director will issue a voucher on behalf of the
tenant to the landlord for the allowed amount of rent.
The voucher will indicate any amount to be applied to a
delinquent balance owed by the landlord, specifying
which delinquency and referring to the authority of RSA
165:4-a.
2. The Welfare Director will issue a duplicate voucher to the
appropriate department which shall forward the voucher
to the Financial Officer for payment. Upon receipt of
payment, the department will issue a receipt of payment
to the delinquent landlord.
72
FORMS AND PAYMENT STANDARDS
The Welfare Director shall determine what forms are required to
implement these standards and shall attach them as
appendages to these guidelines. Forms and current payment
standards for all standards of need calculations shall be
available in the Human Services/Welfare Department.
73
EFFECTIVE DATES AND AMENDMENTS
These guidelines shall apply to determinations of General
Assistance after their adoption by the Board of Selectmen,
Bristol NH 03222. Amendments to these guidelines may be
made by the Board of Selectmen at any proper meeting and
by the Welfare Director as permitted by these guidelines.

1. Building lot dimensions shall not have less than two hundred (200) feet of shoreline frontage for up to ten (10) residential dwelling units, individual campsites, or individual lodging units with deeded rights of use or access. Each additional such unit or camp site shall require an additional twenty (20) linear feet of shore line frontage.
2. A parking area of three hundred (300) square feet adjacent to the waterfront lot shall be provided for each dwelling unit, campsite, or individual lodging unit located in excess of one thousand (1,000) feet from the waterfront property to which it has deed access. Parking shall be permitted only in the designated parking area.

4. At least one-half of the shore frontage shall be reserved for swimming. Swimming areas shall be separated from boating areas by appropriate markers.
5. No more than 25% of the total shore frontage may be dedicated to docks or other structure designed to accommodate boating. All docks require a permit from the New Hampshire Wetlands Board. Applications for dock permits shall be reviewed by the Conservation Commission. In making its recommendations to the Wetlands Board and the Planning Board, the Conservation Commission shall consider the size and depth of the water area, the total frontage proposed for the common area, boat traffic already existing in the area, impact on neighboring property owners, protection of water quality, wildlife habitat and public safety. A buffer of natural vegetation shall be maintained between the beach and/or docking area and the parking area. The buffer may include facilities permitted within the shore front area.
6. Toilet facilities, approved by the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Division, shall be provided at the rate of one toilet facility for males and one for females for each 25 dwelling units or portion thereof granted rights of access.

Leach fields shall be at least one hundred twenty five (125) feet from any shore line (see RSA 483B). There is also a building height restriction as noted in Article 4.4.
d. Alteration of existing uses. Any alteration or expansion of any dwelling or other structure within the lake district which increases the amount of living space in the dwelling or structure and/or would result in any increase in the load on a subsurface sewage system, including conversion to full-time occupancy as defined in NH Code of Administrative Rules Env-Ws 1004.15, shall require a permit from the Land Use Office. If the change would result in any increase in the load on a subsurface sewage system, a permit cannot be issued until the following conditions are met:
1. The applicant has been granted approval of the existing subsurface sewage system for the altered use by the NHDES Subsurface Systems Bureau after submission of an “Application for Individual Sewage Disposal Systems Approval” in accordance with the provisions of NH Code of Administrative Rules ENV-Ws 1004.16. If the existing system is found to be inadequate, a plan approved by the NHDES Subsurface Systems Bureau shall be prepared before a building permit is issued.
2. The applicant must demonstrate that the site conditions and land area are adequate for installation of a replacement sewage disposal system should the existing system malfunction or fail.

D. APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS
In addition to fulfilling any other requirements for construction approval, the applicant for a project subject to the provisions of this article must submit the following:
1. An engineering plan prepared by a professional engineer that shows specific methods that will be used to control soil erosion and sedimentation, soil loss, and excessive stormwater runoff, both during and after construction including clear cuts made for view development. This plan must show the area subject to site disturbance in two-foot contours.
2. A hydrology, drainage, and flooding analysis that shows specific methods that will be used to control soil erosion and sedimentation, soil loss, and excessive stormwater runoff, both during and after construction.
3. A grading plan for the construction site and all access routes.
E. PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
1. The building envelope permitted for projects subject to the provisions of this section is a rectangle with an up-slope boundary 40 feet or less from the building, side boundaries 40 feet or less from each side of the building, and a down-slope boundary 25 feet or less from the building. In the case of non-residential development requiring a parking lot, the area occupied by any such parking lot shall be added to the footprint of the building for the purpose of determining the building envelope. Accessory buildings shall be built within the building envelope. Building envelopes shall be at least 30 feet from property lines. (revised March 13, 2012)
2. In order to develop a view, trees may be trimmed beyond the building envelope for a width of tree topping not to exceed 25 feet measured at building envelope boundary and extending outward therefrom at an angle of 45 degrees or less on both sides, to a point down-slope where the tops of the trees are at the same elevation as the ground floor of the building. The 25-foot opening may be at any point along the down-slope boundary. No clear cutting is allowed outside the building envelope except as provided in this section and for the construction of a driveway.
3. Existing natural and topographic features, including the vegetative cover, will be preserved to the greatest extent possible. The Board shall not approve a proposed layout of building (s) and/or parking lot if it finds that there exists a feasible alternative layout which causes appreciably less disturbance to natural topography and vegetation, yet still fulfills the applicant’s permissible development objectives. In the event that extensive amounts of vegetation are removed, the site shall be replanted with indigenous vegetation and shall replicate the original vegetation as much as possible. (revised March 13, 2012)
4. The grading cut and fill should not exceed a 2:1 ratio.

4.20 External Lighting
(Adopted March 13, 2012)
A. PURPOSE AND INTENT
The purpose of this section is to preserve the rural atmosphere and dark skies of Bristol. One key difference between rural towns and cities is the darkness of the night sky and the amount of glare and sky glow resulting from outdoor lighting. Natural dark skies are the nighttime aspect of rural character. Increasing light pollution and glare from inappropriate lighting degrades such rural character. Effective outdoor lighting can help preserve the dark night sky while maximizing safety and security by minimizing glare and light trespass. This regulation is intended to enhance public safety and welfare by providing for adequate and appropriate outdoor lighting, providing for lighting that will complement the character of the town, reduce glare, minimize light trespass, reduce the cost and waste of unnecessary energy consumption and prevent the degradation of the night sky.
B. DEFINITIONS
1. Full-Cutoff Luminaries: A light fixture such that all of its light output is aimed below horizontal to the ground. Full cut-off fixtures cut off all upward transmission of light.

Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Buildings or Structures-Roof Mounts: When a PWSF extends above the roof height of a building on which it is mounted, it shall be concealed or camouflaged within or behind existing or new architectural features to limit its visibility from public ways. Facilities mounted on a roof shall be stepped back from the front façade in order to limit their impact on the building’s silhouette.
Camouflage for Facilities on Existing Building or Structures-Side Mounts. PWSF which are side mounted shall blend with the existing building’s architecture and, if individual antenna panels are over five (5) square feet, the panels shall be painted or shielded with material consistent with the design feature and materials of the building.
Camouflage for Ground Mounted Facilities. All ground-mounted PWSF shall be surrounded by a buffer of dense tree growth that extends continuously for a minimum distance of one hundred fifty (150) feet from the mount, security barrier, or designated area for access to equipment, whichever is greatest, and screens views of the facility in all directions. These trees must be existing on the subject property, planted on site, or be within a landscape easement on an
67
adjoining site. The Planning Board shall have the authority to decrease, relocate, or alter the required buffer based on site conditions. The one hundred and fifty (150) foot vegetative buffer area shall be protected by a landscape easement or be within the area of the carrier’s lease.

If mounted on a rooftop, the equipment shelter shall be concealed or camouflaged so that the shelter either is not visible at grade or appears to be a part of the original structure.
10.8.4 Lighting, Signage, and Security
Lighting. PWSF shall not be lighted.
Signage. Signs shall be limited to those needed to identify the property and the owner and warn of any danger. All signs shall comply with the requirements of the Town of Bristol Zoning Ordinance.
Security Barrier. The Planning Board shall have final authority on whether a ground mounted PWSF should be surrounded by a security barrier and the height and material used.
10.8.5 Historic Buildings and District
Any PWSF located on or within a historic/cultural area shall not alter the character-defining features, distinctive construction methods, or original historic materials of the building.
Any alteration made to a historic structure to accommodate a PWSF shall be fully reversible.
PWSF authorized by this subsection shall be concealed within or behind existing architectural features, or shall be located so that they are not visible from public roads and viewing areas.
10.8.6 Scenic Landscapes and Vistas. Ground-mounted facilities shall not be located within open areas that are clearly visible from public roads, recreational areas, or abutting properties. All ground-mounted PWSF shall be surrounded by a buffer of dense tree growth as per Section 8.1(F).
68
10.8.7 Driveways. If available, existing entrances and driveways to serve a PWSF shall be utilized, unless the applicant can demonstrate that a new entrance and driveway will result in less visual, traffic, and environmental impact. New driveways to serve a PWSF shall not exceed twelve (12) feet in width and shall include a curve or turn so that the service facility is not visible from the entrance to the driveway. A gravel or crushed stone surface is encouraged.
Planning Board Flexibility: Driveways: In reviewing a Site Plan Review application for a personal wireless service facility, the Planning Board may permit modification of the driveway standards set forth above, as it may deem appropriate, given the specific site conditions.
10.8.8 Antenna Types. Any antenna array placed upon an existing or proposed ground mount, utility pole, or transmission line mount shall have a diameter of no more than four (4) feet, including the diameter of the mount. A larger diameter antenna array may be permitted after a finding by the Planning Board that the visual impact of a larger antenna is negligible.
10.8.9 Ground and Roof Mounts. All ground mounts shall be of a mast type mount. Lattice towers and guyed towers are expressly prohibited.
10.8.10 Hazardous Waste. No hazardous waste shall be discharged on the site of any PWSF. If any hazardous materials are to be used on site, there shall be provisions for full containment of such materials.

69
reasonable written notice to the carrier and landowner, providing them the opportunity to accompany the Town representatives when the measurements are conducted.
10.9.3 Security for Removal. Recognizing the hazardous situation presented by abandoned and unmonitored telecommunications facilities, the Planning Board shall set the form and amount of the security that represents the cost for removal and disposal of abandoned telecommunications facilities in the event that a facility is abandoned and the facility owner is unwilling or unable to remove the facility in accordance with Section 10.2. An irrevocable letter of credit issued by a major bank shall be the preferred form of security. The amount of the security shall be based upon the removal and disposition costs plus fifteen percent (15%) as determined by the Planning Board and as certified by a professional civil engineer licensed in New Hampshire at the expense of the applicant. The owner of the facility shall provide the Planning Board with a revised removal cost estimate every five (5) years from the date of the Planning Board’s approval of the site plan. If the cost has increased, then the owner of the facility shall provide additional security in the amount of the increase plus fifteen (15) percent.

ARTICLE XI
ARTICLE XI.. IMPACT FEE ORDINANCEIMPACT FEE ORDINANCE
11.1 Purpose
This ordinance is enacted pursuant to RSA 674:16 and 674:21, and in order to:
Promote public health, safety, convenience, welfare, and prosperity;
Ensure that adequate and appropriate facilities are available to individuals who may come to be located in the Town of Bristol;
Prevent scattered or premature development of land as would involve danger or injury to health, safety, or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage, transportation, schools, fire protection, or other public services, or necessitate the excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services;
Provide for the harmonious development of the municipality and its environs;
Ensure the proper arrangement and coordination of streets; and,
Ensure streets of sufficient width to accommodate existing and prospective traffic.
11.2 Authority
1. The Planning Board may, as a condition of approval of any subdivision [or site plan], and when consistent with applicable Board regulations, require an applicant to pay an impact fee for the applicant’s fair share of off-site improvements to public facilities affected by the development. The Planning Board shall not require an applicant for a land use permit for a single family residence to pay an impact fee. (revised 3/12/13)
2. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the existing authority of the Planning Board to disapprove proposed development which is scattered or premature, or which would require an excessive expenditure of public funds, or which would otherwise violate applicable ordinances and regulations. Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the Planning Board’s authority to require off-site work to be performed by the applicant, in lieu of paying an impact fee, or the board’s authority to impose other types of conditions of approval. Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect types of fees governed by other statutes, town ordinances or regulations.
71
11.3 Assessment Methodology
11.3.1 Proportionality: The amount of the impact fee shall be calculated by the Planning Board to be a proportional share of municipal capital improvement costs which is reasonably related to the capital needs created by the development, and to the benefits accruing to the development from the capital improvements financed by the fee.
11.3.2 Existing Deficiencies: Upgrading of existing facilities and infrastructures, the need for which is not created by new development, shall not be paid for by impact fees.
11.4 Administration
11.4.1 Accounting: In accord with RSA 673:16, II and RSA 674:21, V©, impact fees shall be accounted for separately, shall be segregated from the Town’s general fund, may be spent upon order of the Board of Selectmen, and shall be used solely for the capital improvements for which it was collected, or to recoup the cost of capital improvements made in anticipation of the needs which the fee was collected to meet.
11.4.2 Assessment: All impact fees imposed pursuant to this section shall be assessed prior to, or as a condition for, the issuance of a land use permit or other appropriate permission to proceed with development, as determined by the Planning Board. (revised 3/12/13)
11.4.3 Security: In the interim between assessment and collection, the Planning Board may require developers to post bonds, issue letters of credit, accept liens, or otherwise provide suitable measures of security so as to guarantee future payment of assessed impact fees.
11.4.4 Collection: Impact fees shall be collected as a condition for the issuance of a land use permit. Nothing in this section shall prevent the Planning Board and the assessed party from establishing an alternate, mutually acceptable schedule of payment. (revised 3/12/13)
11.4.5 Refund: Any portion of an impact fee which has not become encumbered or otherwise legally bound to be spent for the purpose for which it was collected, shall be refunded, with any accrued interest, to the assessed party or successor in interest:
When the subdivision or site plan approval expires under the respective rules of the Planning Board, or under the terms of the decision, without having become vested under RSA 674:39, and without any extension being granted by the Planning Board; OR
When such approval is revoked under RSA 676:4-a; OR
Six years after its collection, or, if any extension of approval is granted by the Planning Board, six years after such extension is granted; OR
Six years after its collection, whenever the calculation of an impact fee has been predicated upon some portion of capital improvement costs being borne by the Town, and the Legislative Body of the Town has failed to appropriate the Town’s share of the capital improvement costs.
72
11.5 Appeals
In accord with RSA 676:5, III, because this Ordinance delegates administration of impact fees to the Planning Board, appeals of impact fee decisions shall be made to the Superior Court pursuant to RSA 677:15, and not to the Zoning Board of Adjustment.
11.6 Definitions
IMPACT FEE: A fee or assessment imposed upon development, including subdivision, building construction or other land use change, in order to help meet the needs occasioned by that development for the construction or improvement of capital facilities owned or operated by the municipality, including and limited to water treatment and distribution facilities; wastewater treatment and disposal facilities; sanitary sewers; storm water, drainage and flood control facilities; public road systems and rights-of-way; municipal office facilities; public school facilities; the municipality’s proportional share of capital facilities of a cooperative or regional school district of which the municipality is a member; public safety facilities; solid waste collection, transfer, recycling, processing and disposal facilities; public library facilities; and public recreational facilities not including public open space.

ARTICLE XII. SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESS ORDINANCEORDINANCE
12.1 Authority
Pursuant to the authority conferred by chapter 674:16 of the New Hampshire Revised Statutes, the Town of Bristol adopts the following ordinance regulating sexually oriented businesses. This ordinance shall be considered part of the Zoning Ordinance for the purposes of administration and appeals under state law. If any provision of this ordinance differs or appears to conflict with any provision of the Zoning Ordinance or other ordinance or regulation, the provision imposing the greater restriction or more stringent standard shall be controlling.
73
12.2 Purpose and Findings
A. Purpose: The purpose of this section is to establish reasonable regulations for Sexually Oriented Business in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the Patrons of such businesses, and of the citizens of the Town of Bristol, and to prevent the deleterious citing of, and/or concentration of, Sexually Oriented Businesses within the Town. It is not the intent of this section to limit the content of, or to restrict or deny adult access to, sexually oriented books, films or other materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by distributors of such materials to their markets. Neither does this section condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.
B. Findings: Evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses upon a community, including the findings incorporated in the U.S. Supreme Court cases of Young v. American Mini Theatres, 426 U.S. 50 (1976), City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986), Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and City of Erie v. Pap’s A.M., 120 S. Ct. 1382 (2000), studies from communities throughout the United States, and evidence made available to the Planning Board and Selectmen, all support the following findings:
1. Sexually Oriented Businesses have a deleterious effect on the area around them, causing downgrading of property values and blight.
2. Patrons and Employees of Sexually Oriented Businesses – especially those with closed booths or other semiprivate areas, and those with live entertainment – engage in a statistically high incidence of sexually risky, unhealthy and unsanitary behavior, which increases the spread of sexually-transmitted and other communicable disease.
3. Sexually Oriented Businesses cause an increase, in their vicinity, in the incidence of ancillary criminal behavior such as drug offenses, prostitution, sexual assaults, and criminal offenses involving children.
4. In order to limit and control these adverse secondary effects, it is desirable to establish both location and operational criteria for such businesses, and to require supervision by the Town by means of a special operational permit.

Article XIV (Small Wind Energy Systems), continued
14.4 Standards
A. The Land Use Office shall evaluate the application for compliance with the following standards:
1. SETBACKS: The setback shall be calculated by multiplying the minimum setback requirement multiplier by the system height, and measured from the center of the tower base to property line, public roads, or nearest point on the foundation of an occupied building.
Minimum Setback Requirement Multipliers:
Occupied buildings on applicant’s property: 0
Occupied buildings on abutting property: 1.5
Property lines of abutting property and utility lines: 1.1
Public roads: 1.5
a. Small wind energy systems must meet all setbacks for principal structures for the zoning district in which the system is located.
b. Guy wires used to support the tower are exempt from the small wind energy system setback requirements.
2. TOWER: The maximum tower height shall be restricted to 35 feet above the tree canopy within 300 feet of the small wind energy system. In no situation shall the tower height exceed 150 feet or 35 feet above the surrounding tree canopy, whichever is less.
3. SOUND LEVEL: The small wind energy system shall not exceed 60 decibels using the A scale (dbA), as measured at the site property line, except during short-term events such as severe wind storms and utility outages.
4. SHADOW FLICKER: Small wind energy systems shall be sited in a manner that does not result in significant shadow flicker impacts. Significant shadow flicker is defined as more than 30 hours per year on abutting occupied buildings. The applicant has the burden of proving that the shadow flicker will not have significant adverse impact on neighboring or adjacent uses. Potential shadow flicker will be addressed either through siting or mitigation measures.
5. SIGNS: All signs, including flags, streamers and decorative items, both temporary and permanent, are prohibited on the small wind energy system, except for manufacturer identification or appropriate warning signs.

1. All new construction or substantial improvement of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the 100 year flood elevation;
2. That all new construction or substantial improvements of non-residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the 100 year flood level; or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
a. be flood-proofed so that below the 100 year flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
b. have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamics loads and the effects of buoyancy; and
c. be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section;
3. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within special flood hazard areas shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood level; the pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and waterloads acting simultaneously on all building components. Water loading value used shall be those associated with the base flood. Wind loading values used shall be those required by applicable State and local building standards.

Article IX. Variances and Appeals
A. Any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Land Use Office made under this ordinance may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment as set forth in RSA 676:5. (amended 3/12/13)
B. If the applicant, upon appeal, requests a variance as authorized by RSA 674:33, I (b), the applicant shall have the burden of showing in addition to the usual variance standards under State Law:
1. that the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense.
2. that if the requested variance is for activity within a designated regulatory floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result.
3. that the variance is necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
C. The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall notify the applicant in writing that:
1. The issuance of a variance to construct below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for Flood Insurance up to amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage; and
2. Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property.
104
Such notification shall be maintained with a record of all variance actions.
D. The community shall (i) maintain a record of all variance actions, including their justification for their issuance, and (ii) report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to FEMA’s Federal Insurance Administrator.
