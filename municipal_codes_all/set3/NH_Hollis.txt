SECTION XI: OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
A. AQUIFER PROTECTION OVERLAY ZONE (APO) (Amended March 2017)
INTENT: By the authority granted in New Hampshire RSA 674:16-17 and 674:20, the Aquifer Protection Overlay
Zone is intended to protect, preserve and maintain existing and potential groundwater supply and groundwater
recharge area of known aquifers, as delineated by the United States Geological Survey (as identified on the Hollis
stratified drift aquifer map available in the Planning Department) thereby assuring the proper use of natural resources
and thus protecting public health, safety and general welfare of the people in the Town of Hollis from adverse
development, land uses, practices and activities which might result in their depletion or contamination. Additional
purposes of the APO Zone include, but are not limited to:
?? Assuring adequate private and public drinking water supply
?? Assuring the hydrologic integrity of surface waters and wetlands
?? Reducing the effects of non-point source pollution
?? Protecting in-stream habitat for fish and wildlife
?? Limiting the development of structures and land uses which contribute to the pollution of ground water by
sewage and hazardous substances
?? Encouraging those uses that can be safely and appropriately located in the APO Zone
?? Assuring adequate water supply for domestic, agricultural, commercial and industrial uses
?? Assuring adequate water supply for recreational uses
The standards used in the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone reflect the recommendations of the Town of Hollis
Master Plan, 1998, the Town of Hollis Water Resources Management Plan, 1989, and the recommendations of the
Town of Hollis Conservation Commission Water Resources Subcommittee. The Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone is
a zoning overlay district, which imposes additional requirements and restrictions to those of the underlying district
zoning. In all cases the more restrictive requirement(s) shall apply.
1. LOCATION
The extent of the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone shall be the outermost edge of the surficial extent of all aquifer
deposits presently designated as stratified drift in the USGS study, Hydrogeology of Stratified-Drift Aquifers and
Water Quality in the Nashua Regional Planning Commission Area, South-Central New Hampshire, 1987.
a. When the actual boundary of the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone is in dispute by any owner or abutter
actually affected by said boundary, the Planning Board (or the Board of Adjustment or other Town authority,
as appropriate), at the owner’s or abutter’s expense and request, may engage a certified soil scientist to
conduct a Site Specific Soil Map of the area in dispute. Areas determined by the USGS as containing
stratified drift aquifer and which also have excessively drained soils will be presumed to lie within the APO
Zone.
b. If the results of the Site Specific Soil Mapping are inconclusive or are unsatisfactory to the Planning Board,
the owner, or the abutter, the Planning Board, at the owner’s or abutter’s expense, may engage a professional
geologist or hydrologist to conduct a hydrogeological study of the area to determine more accurately the
precise boundary of the APO Zone.
2. DEFINITIONS: For purposes of the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone, the following definitions shall apply:
a. Groundwater: Subsurface water that occurs beneath the water table in soils and geologic formations.
b. Surface Water: Those waters, which have standing or flowing water at or on the surface of the ground.
This includes but is not limited to, rivers, streams, lakes, ponds and tidal waters.
c. Water Related Resources: A natural resource that is dependent on water, such as fish, amphibians and
plants.
d. Wetland: Areas as defined in Section VIII of the Hollis Zoning Ordinance.

basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwellings units
or part of the main structure.
aa. SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 % of the market value of
the structure before the damage occurred.
bb. SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or
improvements to a structure in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 % of the market value of the
structure. The market value of the structure should equal:
(i) the appraised value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or
(ii) in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of
this definition, substantial improvement is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration
affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term does not, however, include any project
for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a
historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation
as a historic structure.
cc. VIOLATION: means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the
community’s flood plain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation
certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in 44CFR & 60.3(b)(5), (c)(4),
(c)(10), (d)(3), (e)(2), (e)(4), or (e)(5) is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is
provided.
dd. WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the
flood plains.
2. All proposed development in any special flood hazard area shall require a permit. The Building Inspector shall
review all building permit applications for new construction or substantial improvements to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in an area of
special flood hazard, all new construction or substantial improvements shall:
a. be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy, and
b. be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage, and
c. be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages, and
d. be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment, and other
service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within
the components during conditions of flooding.
3. Where new or replacement water and sewer systems (including on-site systems) are proposed in a special flood
hazard area the applicant shall provide the Building Inspector with assurance that these systems will be designed
to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood
waters, and on-site waste disposal systems will be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from

D. MULTI-FAMILY ZONE (MF) (Workforce Housing)
1. PURPOSE
The intent of this Section is to provide for the opportunity to construct multi-family housing by the provision of
a waiver from the otherwise applicable density requirements, while complying with all applicable state and
federal laws with respect to such housing and at the same time, ensuring compliance with local planning
standards, land use policies, good building design, and requirements for the health, safety, and general welfare
of all the inhabitants of the Town.
2. GENERAL STANDARDS
In order to provide for a variety of workforce housing units in the community, which includes both owner and
renter occupied units, the following criteria shall be required for developments proposed in the Multi-family
Zone:
a. Dwelling unit density shall be no greater than four (4) units per acre, based upon the Net Tract Area of the
property.
b. For any multi-family workforce housing development proposal, a minimum of 25% of the total number of
rental units (market rate and affordable) shall be designated as workforce housing/renter occupied units.
For any multi-family workforce housing/owner occupied development proposal, a minimum of 30% of the
total number of owner occupied units (market rate and affordable) shall be designated as workforce
housing/owner occupied units.
c. Multi-family development projects shall consist of one or two bedroom units. At least 50% of workforce
housing units shall consist of two bedroom units.
d. Adequate on-site space must be provided for off-street parking, water and sewage disposal systems. The
applicant shall demonstrate that the site can accommodate the permitted density as it pertains to its impact
on soil as part of the application for review by the Planning Board.
e. Building types and styles, including exterior aesthetics and unit arrangements, shall be suitable and
appropriate for their intended purpose, in light of the size and scale of the project, the prominence and the
visibility of the proposed project in the community, the surrounding neighborhood, and other similar
factors.
f. The dwellings qualifying as workforce housing units shall be compatible in architectural style and
appearance with the market rate units in the proposed development. The workforce housing units should be
interspersed throughout the overall development and not clustered together in one area.
g. Workforce housing developments shall be exempted from Section IX.J., which limits the number of
dwelling units that can be constructed on a lot.
h. The minimum lot area shall be 4 acres and the lot shall have at least 50 feet of frontage. Garden style

SECTION XII: NONCONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS (Amended 1993)
INTENT: The intent of this section is to allow for the lawful continuance of nonconforming uses, structures and lots, and to
allow a certain reasonable level of alteration, expansion or change to occur by special exception when it can be demonstrated
that the proposed alteration, expansion or change will not change the nature of the use, unduly impact the neighborhood or
provide inadequate subsurface disposal of waste. Of particular concern is the preservation of the quality of the groundwater,
which is Hollis’ source of domestic drinking water. Specific attention to the potential of groundwater contamination arising
from septic systems which are inadequate or located without adequate setbacks from other septic systems and/or drinking water
wells was given in the development of this ordinance.
A. NONCONFORMING USES
1. CONTINUANCE: A nonconforming use may be continued although such use does not conform to the current
provisions of this ordinance.
2. DISCONTINUED USE: Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued for more than two (2) years for
any reason, such nonconforming use shall not thereafter be reestablished, and the future use of the property shall
be in conformity with the provisions of this ordinance.
3. ALTERATIONS: Alteration, expansion or change of a nonconforming use or structure shall only be permitted
by Special Exception by the Zoning Board of Adjustment if it finds that:
a. the proposed alteration, expansion or change will not change the nature and purpose of the original use, and
b. the proposed alteration, expansion or change would involve no substantially different effect on the
neighborhood, and
c. any increase in heated living space, as proposed by the plans submitted which, in the judgment of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment, is reasonably capable of increasing the number of bedrooms for a nonconforming
dwelling or lot, may require the septic system to be approved by the New Hampshire Division of Water
Supply and Pollution Control and the Town of Hollis in accordance with the provisions of New Hampshire
RSA 485-A: 38 and the Town of Hollis’ septic regulations for the number of bedrooms currently in the home
or proposed for the home.
B. NONCONFORMING LOTS
1. A nonconforming lot which has been developed with a structure may be continued for the same use but any
alteration, expansion, new construction or change shall only be permitted according to the provisions set forth
in item number 3, ALTERATIONS, as described above for A. NONCONFORMING USES. Provided, however,
that any alteration, expansion, new construction or change that can be accomplished in a manner that will comply
with the applicable setbacks for that district, shall be permitted.
2. A separate lot which does not conform to the provisions of this Ordinance, which is recorded and taxed as a lot
of record at the time of passage of this Ordinance may be used for any conforming use of this district.
3. Any changes to existing septic systems on nonconforming lots must meet the Town of Hollis’ Board of Health
Subsurface Disposal Regulations.
4. The Zoning Board of Adjustment may grant a special exception to setback requirements for non-conforming lots
of less than two acres in the Historic District if the Zoning Board finds that:
a. Strict adherence to the existing setbacks would detrimentally impact the Historic District and disturb the
streetscape; or
b. Strict adherence to the existing setbacks would cause inconsistency in the massing of buildings; or
c. Strict adherence to the existing setbacks would be inconsistent with setbacks of existing adjacent buildings;
or
d. If the structure as designed takes into consideration architectural and spatial elements of adjacent buildings
an exception may be granted.
e. The ZBA will consider (but is not necessarily bound by) the recommendations of the HDC.

CONTINUANCE: Any lawful nonconforming structure existing at the time of adoption of this Ordinance, may be
occupied, operated, and maintained in a state of good repair, but any alteration, expansion, new construction or change
of such structure that does not further aggravate a front, side, or rear yard setback nonconformity shall only be
permitted according to the provisions set forth in item number 3, ALTERATIONS, paragraphs a and b, as described
above for A. NONCONFORMING USES, and according to the diagram below.

When reading and using this document, the INTENT of each section should carry more weight in decision making
than the specific wording of each section. An attempt is made to state the intent at the beginning of each section. This
statement of intent should be used as a guide to interpretation of any specific paragraph, article or provision.
It is the intent of this Sign Ordinance to support the general provisions of the 1991 Hollis Town Master Plan which

were designed to encourage reasonable uniformity in the size, treatment and presentation of signs used to call attention
to the existence of a business, activity, product or service. The ultimate goal of this Sign Ordinance is to ensure traffic
safety, prevent obstructions in rights-of-ways, allow the existence of signs that aid orientation and identification of
uses and activities to the public without degradation of the surrounding property or properties in any area, while, at
the same time, understanding and meeting the need for adequate business identification and advertising.

SECTION XV: HOLLIS RURAL CHARACTER PRESERVATION ORDINANCE (Adopted March
2004)
A. AUTHORITY: This ordinance is promulgated by the Town of Hollis Town Meeting as an amendment to the existing
zoning ordinance, pursuant to the authority provided to said Town by RSA 674:15.
B. APPLICABILITY: This ordinance applies to the entire area of the Town of Hollis and to every zoning district therein
as an overlay district. The provisions of this ordinance do not alter the list of permissible uses or the dimensional
requirements of any district in any way, but address the manner in which development occurs and its placement on
the landscape. All subdivision plans and site plans for commercial or industrial uses are required to comply with the
provisions of this section. The Planning Board is empowered to modify or waive the requirements of this section as
described in Section E below. The Planning Board is also empowered to adopt regulations to implement the intent of
purposes of this ordinance.
C. OBJECTIVE: To preserve and maintain Hollis' scenic vistas and rural character, particularly as seen from Public
Roads, and maintain woodlands and open spaces through the use of visually unobtrusive and environmentally sound
development, while permitting the landowner to exercise his/her property rights in a manner that does not affect the
density of development.
Means: This ordinance shall provide a mechanism for the Planning Board to reasonably regulate the design,
placement and buffering or screening of buildings, other structures, roads and driveways in the process of subdivision
and site plan application review, in such a way as to best preserve the rural and scenic qualities of Hollis' landscape,
in order to:
1. Eliminate the siting of new construction on or near the crest of prominent hilltops and ridges, particularly as seen
from Public Roads.
2. Fit development into the landscape to minimize significant landscape alterations.
3. Buffer or screen development with vegetation where a natural wooded buffer or screen is sparse or non-existent.
D. DEFINITIONS
1. ANLA STANDARDS: Refers to the American Nursery and Landscape Association's publication, "American
Standards for Nursery Stock", as amended.
2. BUFFERING: The use of vegetation or other visual barriers to soften or reduce the visual impact of buildings,
manmade features and/or clearings associated with development.
3. SCREENING:The use of vegetation or other visual barriers to block the view of buildings and manmade features
associated with development.
4. CLEAR-CUTTING: For purposes of this ordinance, clear-cutting is defined as the cutting of at least 50% of the
total forest cover on a lot.
5. FOREST COVER: The total canopy expanse of a contiguous group of trees.
6. NATIVE SPECIES/NATIVE VEGETATION: Those species whose presence in the area extends to pre-Colonial
times.
7. RETAINING STRUCTURES: A wall or other structure designed by a qualified professional engineer and placed
at the toe (bottom) of a slope.
8. RIDGELINE: The long, relatively narrow crest or horizontal line of hills, usually at the highest elevation.
E. WAIVERS
The Planning Board is expressly empowered to modify or waive any requirement of this Rural Character Preservation
Ordinance when requested in writing, if the applicant demonstrates and the Planning Board finds, after a hearing, that:
1. The requirements of this ordinance will prevent the applicant from being able to develop the subject property to
a density otherwise acceptable to the Hollis Planning Board and permitted in the Hollis Zoning Ordinance; and,
2. The requested waiver is the minimum deviation necessary to permit the applicant the maximum permissible
density acceptable to the Hollis Planning Board, and that the remainder of the submission, to the extent possible,
conforms to the purposes and intent of this ordinance.

F. DESIGN STANDARDS
It is the intent of this ordinance to complement the Hollis zoning ordinance and subdivision and site plan regulations.
This ordinance protects the scenic landscape of Hollis through standards governing the placement and buffering or
screening of structures and other man-made features on the landscape.
1. Standards for vegetative buffering and screening of building sites and cleared areas
Screening should be placed in the open space areas of developments as much as possible. Open space in
subdivisions should be configured so as to maximize the buffering and/or screening of building sites and disturbed
areas. The Planning Board may determine whether buffering and/or screening is appropriate in each situation.
The following design standards should be used where appropriate.
a. Minimize the removal of existing vegetation that serves to buffer or screen proposed buildings and other
manmade features. Trees may only be removed for the construction of streets, driveways, structures, well
and septic systems and lawn or meadow areas or as part of a timberstand improvement program.
b. Do not use stone riprap as a substitute for plantings in areas disturbed by earthmoving operations. Such areas
are to be re-vegetated by appropriate means for screening, buffering and/or erosion control, and using
appropriate plants. (See also 4, Road and Driveway Design and Placement Standards, paragraph f.)
c. Use plantings to screen or buffer buildings in open or visibly prominent areas. If existing vegetation provides
insufficient buffering of screening, use plantings that are compatible with existing vegetation, and/or are
composed of native species. Plant trees in random clusters, not in rows, to simulate the appearance of natural
tree stands.
d. Do not use plants considered to be exotic invasive by the New Hampshire Department of Agriculture, and/or
included on the State of New Hampshire's list of Prohibited Plants, or Prohibited Plants with restrictions.
e. Follow the most current ANLA minimum size standards for plants used as vegetative buffering or screening
as follows:
?? Deciduous shade trees: not less than 2 inch caliper and 8 feet tall
?? Deciduous ornamental trees: not less than 1.5 inch caliper and 6 feet tall
?? Deciduous shrubs: not less than 3 to 4 feet tall
?? Coniferous evergreen trees: not less than 5 feet tall
?? Coniferous and broadleaved evergreen shrubs: not less than 24 to 30 inches tall, or wide, if of a spreading
nature.
f. Plant vegetative buffering or screening of such a size and density to provide a reasonable expectation of
buffering or screening development within five years.
g. Include a canopy layer and an understory layer in vegetative buffering or screening, unless the specific
situation warrants otherwise.
h. Submit a management plan describing maintenance procedures for all plantings with the subdivision or site
plan application. The management plan should address such issues as the schedule of planting, watering,
fertilizing, pest control, trimming/tree maintenance and similar matters.
i. Any property that has been clear-cut within the preceding ten (10) year period, and/or will be as a result of
any proposed development, shall be required to conduct revegetation or other mitigation as deemed necessary
by the Planning Board in order to comply with the intent and purposes of this ordinance.
2. Standards pertaining to construction on slopes, hillsides and/or ridgeline situations.
a. In the course of its review of a subdivision or site plan, the Planning Board may identify any characteristic,
view or vista, as seen from a Public Road, that it deems of sufficient importance to warrant consideration
pursuant to this ordinance. Once such characteristics, view or vista are so identified, the design of the project
shall be governed by the following:
?? Building sites (structures plus the lawn area cleared of trees) and aboveground utilities, shall be located
downgrade of the ridgeline whenever possible, and located so they do not interfere with the identified
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 73
Amended March 12, 2019
characteristic or view or vista identified in the course of Planning Board review.
?? In addressing this standard, the Planning Board may require the applicant to locate building sites
downgrade from the identified characteristic, view or vista and may impose conditions limiting the
vertical or horizontal distance of the building site(s) from the identified characteristic, view or vista so
as to give effect to the purposes and objectives of this ordinance.
?? The Planning Board can modify this requirement when doing so does not detract from the purpose of
this ordinance, and mitigation measures, such as plantings or topographical features, effectively screen
the building site or otherwise mitigate any impact to the identified characteristic, view or vista as seen
from a Public Road.
b. Maintain the natural appearance of the crest of a hill or ridgeline with tree planting and other landscaping
measures so the post-development profile of the ridgeline or crest matches, or very closely approximates, its
pre-development profile.
c. Conduct grading or earth moving operations so the final, post-development contours appear to be consistent
with the pre-development terrain, both on and adjacent to building sites.
d. Employ "contour grading" techniques where feasible. "Contour grading" means creating artificial slopes
with curves of varying slope ratios in the horizontal plan designed to match the appearance of the surrounding
natural terrain. Use the following techniques to accomplish this:
(i) Incorporate varied cut and fill banks and drainage terraces to alleviate monotony and allow for
natural appearing landscaping.
(ii) Incorporate berms at the top of slopes and other locations to screen and direct drainage away from
steep slopes.
(iii) Use retaining structures, compatible with the natural surroundings, when they will significantly
reduce grading and land disturbance.
e. Avoid long linear slopes, except in cases where the natural slopes, except in cases where the natural slope
configuration displays this form. When appropriate, cut and fill slopes shall have curved configurations that
reflect the surrounding topographical context. Round the toe (bottom) and top of slopes to avoid forms at
the convergence of manufactured and natural slopes.
3. Standards for development in open fields and other situations with sparse existing vegetation
a. Locate buildings in the least visually intrusive manner possible. Locate buildings on the edge of open fields,
or just within the edge of bordering woodlands, or create new tree lines, buffers or screening measures.
b. Locate new roads and driveways in the least visually intrusive manner possible. Follow existing contours
instead of cutting across the field at the shortest distance between the building and the roadway.
c. When development is proposed on land in active agricultural use, it is preferable to keep some land in
agricultural production through means such as limited development, agricultural restrictions, easements and
other planning tools.
d. Cluster building lots and structures (whether or not the application in also a HOSPD subdivision) to preserve
open areas and vistas into and out of the site.
e. Use landscaping and plantings to buffer and/or screen buildings in open or visibly prominent areas. Use
landscaping and plantings that are compatible with existing vegetation. Any plant used as vegetative
buffering or screening must not be considered to be an exotic invasive, by the New Hampshire Department
of Agriculture and/or included on the State of New Hampshire's list of Prohibited Plants, or Prohibited Plants
with Restrictions.
f. Plant trees in random clusters, not in rows, to simulate the appearance of natural tree stands.
g. Retain existing stone walls and stone foundations and incorporate them into the overall landscaping design.
h. Create or recreate meadows in disturbed open areas by mechanical seeding and/or landscaping. Use plants
that are appropriate to the conditions of the site, with an emphasis on the use of native species. Do not use

with Restrictions.
4. Road and Driveway Placement Design Standards
a. Align roadways and driveways to conform to the natural contours of the land.
b. Avoid long stretches of straight road by using gentle horizontal and vertical curves,
c. Do not place roadways parallel to one another to avoid creating a "shelving" effect on hillsides.
d. Use cul-de-sacs, loop streets, and common driveways to reduce the amount of impermeable surfaces, without
sacrificing legitimate safety and road maintenance concerns.
e. Reduce roadway width when such design minimizes the amount of necessary earthwork and does not
compromise safety concerns.
f. Stabilize and restore cuts and fills on slopes by using plantings and other measures approved by Town staff.
5. Utilities
a. Construct and route utilities underground except in those situations where natural features prevent their
underground siting or where or where safety considerations necessitate aboveground construction or routing.
b. Construct and route aboveground utilities to minimize detrimental effects on the scenic qualities of the site
and surrounding area.
6. Erosion Control
a. Restrict the post development runoff rate and volume to match the pre-development rate or volume
for each offsite flow area based upon a ten-year rainfall event. The first 1/2 inch of runoff from all impervious
areas is to be retained on site. Treated runoff should infiltrate into the ground in an amount approximately
equaling pre-development runoff conditions. Roof runoff is considered "treated" for the purposes of
infiltration. If, after a recommendation by the Town Engineer, the Planning Board makes the determination
that strict adherence to the above rate and volume regulations may cause more environmental harm than
good, then offsite rates and/or volumes may be increased above pre-development conditions by as much as
25%. However, drainage in wetland conservation overlay (WCO) zones must adhere to the standards
provided in Section XI.C.4 of the Hollis Zoning Ordinance, which requires that there be no net increase in
peak flow or overall volume of stormwater runoff in the WCO zone as a result of any development. At no
time shall offsite flow increases be allowed onto an objecting abutter's property.
b. Use appropriate sediment and erosion control measures to minimize the impacts during and after
construction. Any such measures using man-made materials such as woven synthetic textiles must be
removed from the site after the soils are stabilized and vegetation is established.

movement of earth materials shall be a permitted use. The intent of this Ordinance is to establish the locations in
which excavations may be permitted, while also protecting sensitive natural resources, cultural and historic areas, and
existing residences from the adverse impacts of excavations.
B. EXCAVATIONS: Districts where permitted, prohibited and allowed by special exception:
a. Excavation or movement of earth materials shall be permitted or prohibited within certain zoning districts as
follows:
(i) Permitted: Within the boundaries of the Industrial Zone-(I);
(ii) Prohibited: Within the boundaries of each of the following zones:

(iii) Within all other zones (Rural Lands (RL), Residential and Agricultural (R&A), Flood Plain Overlay
(FPO), and Aquifer Protection Overlay (APO)), excavations of less than 5,000 cubic yards/year may
be permitted by the Regulator in accordance with the Town’s Excavation Regulations (promulgated
11/28/83, and as amended) provided that:
?? No more than 50% of abutting property (as determined in Section IX,A.3.a, below) is used for
residential purposes at the time of application;
?? Traffic generated by the excavation does not increase average weekday traffic by more than
20% on any affected roadway; and
?? No permit shall be granted for a duration of more than one year, but may be renewable at
Regulator’s option if conditions existing at issuance of permit have not materially changed.
(iv) Within all other districts (Rural Lands (RL), Residential & Agricultural (R&A), Flood Plain Overlay

Amended March 12, 2019
C. SPECIAL EXCEPTIONS: The Hollis Zoning Board of Adjustment, in acting on requests for special exceptions
under this Ordinance, shall be guided in its deliberations by the following considerations:
a. THE PROXIMITY OF EXISTING RESIDENCES to the site of the proposed excavation, such that no
excavation shall be permitted which cannot maintain the required 75-foot buffer from all property lines Generally,
excavations shall not be permitted where 50% or more of abutting property is used for residential purposes at the
time of application. This standard shall be interpreted to mean:
(i) an abutting property shall be deemed used for residential purposes where a residential structure is
located within 200' of the excavation site property line; and
(ii) the percentage of residentially-used abutting property is determined by measuring the length of
shared property boundary between such abutting property and the excavation site, relative to the
total external dimensions of the excavation site property.
b. TRAFFIC AND TRANSPORTATION impacts such that: To the extent feasible all excavations shall take direct
access from a “collector” class street or better. Additionally, all proposed excavations shall submit to the Zoning
Board of Adjustment a proposed truck-routing plan and traffic impact study which estimates annual, weekly, and
daily truck trips to and from the site, as well as actual traffic counts for all roads to be affected by the excavation.
Any excavation proposal which will have the effect of increasing average hourly volume during weekday periods
of operation by 20% or more on any affected road shall be prohibited. Excavations shall only take access from
or to a designated scenic road where the Zoning Board of Adjustment determines that use will not adversely affect
the roadway’s physical capacity or quality of its scenic character.
c. WATER RESOURCE PROTECTION: Such that any excavation proposed to occur in the Aquifer Protection
Overlay Zone (APO) shall not be permitted to be excavated to a depth of less than 8 feet above the seasonal high
water mark, unless development rights are deeded to the Town of Hollis for such areas, in which case excavation
shall not be permitted within 2 feet of the seasonal high water mark. Acceptance of such development rights shall
be at the discretion of the Regulator.
d. DIMINUTION OF VALUE of surrounding or abutting property shall be considered. Any excavation which will
have the effect of permanently and unavoidably diminishing the value of abutting properties shall not be
permitted. Temporary (up to 3 years) impacts on property values shall not be the sole basis of denial of a special
exception for excavations.
e. PROJECT SCALE, INTENSITY, AND DURATION: Reasonable limitations on the amount of material to be
excavated, the traffic generated, and the duration of the proposed excavation may be established by the Zoning
Board of Adjustment in approving special exceptions.
f. OTHER PROHIBITED PROJECTS as described in NH RSA 155-E:4, shall not be permitted by special
exception. Any excavation proposed to occur below road level within 100' of any public right of way, unless
such excavation is for the purpose of such right of way, shall be prohibited.
2. NOTHING IN THIS ORDINANCE shall limit or abridge the jurisdiction of the Hollis Planning Board to act as
“Regulator” of excavation or removal of earth materials pursuant to RSA Chapter 155-E and regulations lawfully
promulgated pursuant thereto.
3. THIS ORDINANCE SHALL NOT apply to such excavation or removal of earth materials as is excepted from the
effect of RSA 155-E by the provisions of RSA 155-E:2, provided, however, that excavation excepted under RSA 155-
E:2 shall continue to be subject to this Ordinance.
4. APPEALS: Decisions of the Zoning Board of Adjustment regarding excavations may be reheard by the Zoning Board
of Adjustment pursuant to RSA 676:5-7. Decisions of the Planning Board, acting as Regulator, may be reheard by
the Planning Board, pursuant to RSA 155-E:9.
5. EARTH or EARTH MATERIALS shall mean sand, gravel, rock, soil, or construction aggregate.

contrary is demonstrated by the applicant. In cases where the Planning Board determines that a parcel is unsuited
to development as a HOSPD, it may waive the requirements of this Section IX,J and permit the parcel to be
developed as a conventional subdivision subject to the Point Criteria System, below.
b. EXEMPTIONS: Subdivisions creating five (5) or fewer lots are exempt from this requirement, provided there
is no potential for further subdivision of any of the lots therein or the parent parcel. However, an applicant, may,
at his/her option, develop subdivisions of five (5) or fewer lots according to HOSPD standards. Any major
subdivision not subject to HOSPD requirements shall meet the Point Criteria System.
Subdivisions solely creating lots which will not be used for building purposes shall be exempt from HOSPD
requirements.
Subdivisions where each lot is at least 5 acres shall be exempt from HOSPD requirements, provided the deed for
each lot contains a restriction prohibiting the further subdivision of the lot, such deeds to be presented to the
Planning Board for recording in the Hillsborough County Registry of Deeds within one month after final approval
of the subdivision, and further provided that a note shall be included on the final subdivision plan containing the
same restriction and specifically identifying the lots so restricted.
c. CONCEPTUAL LONG RANGE PLAN: When a subdivision plan is proposed to include lots which are capable
of further subdivision, or, when after subdivision a parcel(s) remains which is capable of further subdivision, the
Planning Board may require that a conceptual long range plan for the entire parent parcel be presented so that the
board may consider the entirety of a project and its impacts. This long range plan is non-binding, and is intended
to guide the Planning Board in its assessment of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of current and
possible future development. In such cases, point system review per the Land Subdivision Regulations shall be
based on the long range plan.
d. PROCEDURES: HOSPD plan submission, review and approval procedures shall be as described in the Hollis
Land Subdivision regulations.

TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 86
Amended March 12, 2019
a. DENSITY
(i) The density of dwelling units in a HOSPD shall be no greater than one dwelling unit per 2 acres of
Net Tract Area.
(ii) The number of dwelling units permitted in a HOSPD shall be no greater than the number of units
that would be possible if the parent parcel were wholly subdivided in a conventional manner (i.e.:
without an open-space set-aside). In order to arrive at this number, the applicant may either submit
a conceptual plan showing how the parcel could be subdivided in a conventional manner, or
otherwise demonstrate the possible number of conventional lots in a manner acceptable to the
Planning Board. The possible number of conceptual conventional lots will be determined with the
use of Site Specific Soil Mapping. For purposes of determining the number of HOSPD lots, each
conceptual conventional lot must meet the requirements of a buildable lot as defined in the Hollis
Zoning Ordinance, and meet all other applicable requirements of the Zoning Ordinance and Land
Subdivision Regulations.
b. LOT SIZE
(i) While the overall density of dwelling units in a HOSPD shall be no greater than one dwelling unit
per 2 acres, individual lots may be reduced to a minimum of one acre, provided that all lots have a
contiguous area of at least one acre of acceptable land.
(ii) Backland lots in a HOSPD may be reduced to a minimum of 2 acres, provided they have a minimum
of 20 feet of frontage and a contiguous area of at least one and one-half (1 1/2) acres of acceptable
land.
(iii) All lots in a HOSPD need not necessarily be reduced in size or frontage as compared to lots in a
conventional subdivision. The Planning Board encourages a diversity of lots sizes and styles so as
to ensure that a diversity of housing types and lifestyles remains available in the Town.
(iv) HOSPD lots developed on a preexisting road shall have a minimum size of two (2) acres.
(v) No portion of a reduced acreage HOSPD lot (less than two acres per lot, or less than four acres per
backland lot) shall be located within two hundred feet of an existing road. Reduced acreage lots
shall be separated from existing roads by open space, as described in Section IX,J.5.d below.
“Existing road” shall mean any public highway not developed as a part of a PUD or HOSPD.
c. FRONTAGE
(i) For HOSPD lots developed along a pre-existing Town road: 200 feet minimum per lot.
(ii) For HOSPD lots developed along a new subdivision road: 125 feet average per lot. The absolute
minimum frontage for a HOSPD building lot on a new subdivision road shall be 100 feet.
(iii) For Backland lots: 20 feet minimum per lot. Backland lot frontage shall not be included in
calculating the average frontages cited in Section IX.J.5.c.(i-ii).
d. OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
(i) Open space, as defined in Section VIII of the Hollis Zoning Ordinance, shall have a shape,
dimension, character and location suitable to assure its use for park, recreation, conservation or
agricultural purposes. In determining whether the intent of this section has been satisfied, the
Planning Board shall consider the extent to which land having one or more of the following
characteristics is included in the proposed open space:
?? Preservation of land for the town greenway system as described in the Hollis Master Plan
?? Preservation and utilization of areas designated as prime agricultural soils as mapped by the
NRCS (Natural Resources Conservation Service) in their latest report.
?? Preservation and utilization of active farmland or orchards
?? Preservation of large tracts of interconnected woodlands, wetlands, or other wildlife habitat, or
preservation of open lands that connect to protected land in adjacent parcel(s).
?? Provision of active and/or passive outdoor recreational areas
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
ZONING ORDINANCE
Page 87
Amended March 12, 2019
?? Protection of land along scenic roads and highways
?? Protection of existing trail networks on land on which new trails will be developed as part of the
HOSPD for integration into an existing trail network.
(ii) For a HOSPD with a density of 3 or more acres per one dwelling unit of the gross tract area: 40%
of the tract must be set aside as permanently protected open space for recreation, conservation, or
agricultural uses. No portion of the open space land may consist of wetlands, hydric soils, surface
waters, flood plains, and areas with unaltered slopes greater than 25%. Roadways rights-of-way
and driveways shall not be counted as open land.
(iii) For a HOSPD with a density of less than 3 acres per one dwelling unit of the gross tract area: 50%
of the tract must be set aside as permanently protected open space for recreation, conservation, or
agricultural uses. No portion of the open space land may consist of wetlands, hydric soils, surface
waters, flood plains, and areas with unaltered slopes greater than 25%. Roadway rights-of-way and
driveways shall not be counted as open space land.
(iv) The open or common land must be contiguous to each house lot in the HOSPD. The Planning Board
may waive this requirement only when conditions of topography, wetlands, or other physical site
constraints prevent such an arrangement; or when the land best suited for open land use, in the
judgment of the Planning Board, is situated towards one end of the tract or contiguous to existing
conservation lands. In such cases, the open land must be configured so as to achieve the
conservation or recreation objectives of this section.
(v) When, due to physical constraints such as soils, topography, wetlands or other natural features,
application of the open space requirements cited in Section IX,J.5.a and Section IX,J.5.b prevents
an applicant from realizing the same number of lots/units as would be possible by a conventional
subdivision, the Planning Board may consider and approve a reduction of the open space
requirement. Such a reduction shall nonetheless otherwise maximize open space.
(vi) OPEN SPACE OWNERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT Open space shall be conveyed to a
homeowner’s association, whose membership includes all the owners of lots or units contained in
the tract, or shall be permanently protected in other suitable ways which would ensure the continued
use of the land for intended purposes and proper maintenance of the land. Conveyance of open
space to the Town would be another option available to the developer with agreement from the
Conservation Commission and the Board of Selectmen.
e. BUILDING SETBACKS
The following setbacks shall apply to all principal structures, except that no principal structure may be located
within the 35 feet of the perimeter boundary of a HOSPD development:
Front Yard: 50 feet
Side Yard: 17 ½ feet
Rear Yard: 17 ½ feet
Accessory Structures shall be a minimum of 15 feet (fifteen feet) from side and rear lot lines.
6. WORKFORCE HOUSING UNITS/OWNER OCCUPIED
Single and two-family workforce housing units/owner occupied are permitted, provided the following criteria are
adhered to:
1. Density: The maximum number of allowable dwelling units that could be developed under the provisions outlined
in Section 5.a shall be determined following the standard practice for a Market Rate Housing development. Once
the number of HOSPD lots has been determined and agreed to by the Planning Board then that lot figure may be
increased by 30%. These additional lots shall be designated as workforce housing units/owner occupied.
2. Lot Size: There is no minimum lot size for workforce housing units. The proposed site shall have adequate soils
to accommodate on-site wastewater treatment and an adequate water supply adhering to both local and state
requirements. A Building Area shall not be required; however, at least 50% of the lot shall be Acceptable Land.
In addition, wells serving both workforce housing and market rate housing lots may be located in designated Open
Space areas.

Amended March 12, 2019
With the goal of meeting the Open Space requirements in Section 5.d., the size of Market Rate Housing lots, as
outlined in Section 5.b. may be reduced in order to accommodate the permitted workforce housing units. If it is
determined, to the satisfaction of the Planning Board, that market Rate Housing lots cannot be reduced enough or
at all because of septic and/or water supply regulations in order to accommodate the total permitted housing unit
density, then the Planning Board may consider one or more of the following options in order to accommodate the
increased density:
a. The building area requirement for Market Rate Housing lots may be reduced in size.
b. Open space areas can be used to satisfy lot area requirements. The amount of Open Space area used
shall be the minimum needed in order to accommodate the permitted project density.
c. Septic system areas may be located in designated Open Space areas. The Planning Board shall consider
the following: the environmental sensitivity of the Open Space; the proximity of wetland areas; the
ability to consolidate septic systems in one area to create an “open field” environment; the quality of the
Open Space soils and other factors deemed appropriate by the Planning Board.
3. Frontage: Workforce housing lots shall have a minimum of 20 feet of frontage. Workforce housing lots shall not
be developed or front along an existing road. In order to meet the lot size and open space goals noted above, the
frontage requirements outlined in Section 5.c.ii may be reduced for Market Rate lots if deemed necessary by the
Planning Board in order to meet the Purpose of Section XVIII.
4. Building Setbacks: Shall be as noted in Section 5.e.
5. The dwellings qualifying as Workforce housing units shall be compatible in architectural style and appearance
with the Market Rate units in the proposed development. To achieve this, workforce housing units may be
interspersed throughout the overall development, or clustered together in one or more area(s).
6. Workforce housing units shall contain no more than three bedrooms.
7. To ensure that the application is completed as permitted, a phasing plan for the project shall provide for the
development of workforce housing units concurrently with the market rate housing units. The dwellings
qualifying as workforce housing shall be made available for occupancy on approximately the same schedule as a
project’s market rate housing units, except that the certificates of occupancy for the last 10 percent of the market
rate housing units shall be withheld until certificates of occupancy have been issued for all the workforce housing
units. A schedule setting forth the phasing of the total number of units in a project under this section, along with
a schedule setting forth the phasing of the required workforce housing units shall be established prior to the
issuance of a building permit for any development subject to the provisions of this section.
8. Projects proposing to include workforce housing units shall be exempt from the provisions of Section XIII,
Residential Construction Timing and Phasing Ordinance for both market rate housing and workforce housing
units. (Repealed March 2107)

listed in Section XXI.A1l.
f. No more than fifteen (15%) percent of the tract may be covered by impermeable surfaces.
g. The design and site layout of the development shall emphasize the rural character of the Town, maximize the
privacy of the dwelling units, preserve the natural character of land, provide for the separation of parking and
living areas, and consider such factors as orientation, energy usage, views.
h. The development shall be landscaped so as to enhance its compatibility with the Town with emphasis given
to the use of existing, natural features where possible.
i. The perimeter of the development shall be treated with a landscaped buffer strip to minimize its intrusion on
neighboring land uses.
j. The development shall provide for 40% open space, exclusive of wetlands, surface waters, hydric soils, flood
plain, and unaltered steep slopes greater than 25%.
k. A proposed site shall have adequate soil to accommodate on-site wastewater treatment. Water supply shall
be adequate for, and the water system shall be designed to provide, the maximum flow practical for firefighting

condominium conveyance or building development. It includes resubdivision, and, when appropriate to the
context, relates to the process of subdividing or to the land or territory subdivided. The division of a parcel
of land held in common and subsequently divided into parts among several owners shall be deemed
subdivision under this regulation.
SECTION III. PROCEDURE
SECTION III.1. SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE
A. APPLICATION: Before any subdivision is made, or before the transfer or sale of any part thereof, or
before the construction of streets, or before the installation of municipal services therein, or before any
application for a permit for the erection of a structure thereon shall be made, the owner thereof or his
authorized agent, shall apply in writing to the Planning Board of the Town of Hollis, for approval of such
subdivision. The application shall be made on the form provided by the Hollis Planning Board.
B. (1) OPTIONAL PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW: The Planning Board recognizes the desirability of being
able to meet with a potential applicant prior to the submission of a formal application to discuss the
concepts of a proposal. The purpose of the conceptual consultation is to ensure complete knowledge of
applicable rules and regulations, to save time in the preparation of plans, to ensure that an adequate plan is
submitted and to acquaint the Board with the intentions of the applicant.
The Board and the applicant may discuss proposals in conceptual form only and in general terms such as
desirability of types of developments and proposals under the Master Plan. Such discussion may occur
without the necessity of giving formal public notice as required in Section III.E of these regulations, but
such discussions may occur only at formal meetings of the Board.
Requests for a conceptual consultation shall be submitted to the Planning Board Office no less than fifteen
(15) days prior to a regular meeting of the Board and shall be properly posted as part of the Board’s agenda
as required by the applicable State Statutes and the by-laws of the Board.
(2) REQUIRED PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW: In appropriate circumstances when the scope of the
impact of the proposed subdivision warrants, the Planning Board may require an applicant to participate in
a preliminary conceptual consultation phase and/or design review phase (pursuant to RSA 676:4II), prior to
consideration of any application for acceptance (pursuant to RSA 676:4I.b).
C. Application and plans will be reviewed by Planning Staff for conformance with the requirements of these
regulations. A Complete Application sufficient to invoke jurisdiction of the Board shall be submitted to and
accepted by the Board only at a public meeting of the Board with notice as provided in Section III.1.E.
Only the Board can make a final determination as to an application’s completeness; if Planning Staff, in its
opinion, finds an application to be incomplete, an applicant may nevertheless direct that it be submitted to
the Board to determine whether it is sufficiently complete for acceptance.
Final applications must be accompanied by a list including the names and mailing addresses of the
following:
?? the applicant;
?? all holders of conservation, preservation or agricultural restrictions on the subject property or
properties, as indicated in town records not more than five (5) days before the day of filing;
?? all abutters, including the holders of conservation, preservation or agricultural restrictions on
abutting properties as indicated in town records not more than five (5) days before the day of
Page 3
July 8, 2016
filing;
?? any owner of any upstream dam, if applicable;
?? any engineer, architect, land surveyor, wetland or soil scientist whose professional seal appears on
any plat submitted as part of the application.
In addition, the application must include the payment of all fees as per the approved schedule of fees; five
(5) prints of all the drawings to be recorded, five(5) prints of topography and road profiles.
D. The Planning Board shall, at the next regular meeting or within 30 days following the delivery of the
application, determine if the application is complete and shall vote upon its acceptance. Upon
determination by the Board that a submitted application is complete according to the Board’s regulations,
the Board shall begin formal consideration and shall act to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove
the application within 65 days, subject to extensions and waivers per RSA 674:4.
E. The Planning Board shall send notice of the date upon which the application will be formally submitted to
the Board. Such notice will be sent by certified mail at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting to the
applicant, all abutters, including the holders of conservation, preservation or agricultural restrictions on
abutting properties as indicated in town records not more than five (5) days before the day of filing; all
holders of conservation, preservation or agricultural restrictions on the subject property or properties, as
indicated in town records not more than five (5) days before the day of filing; and any engineer, architect,
land surveyor, wetland or soil scientist whose professional seal appears on any plat submitted as part of the
application. For proposals near rivers and streams and downstream of a dam, the Planning Board shall also
notify by certified mail the owners of the upstream dam and the Department of Environmental Services
Dam Bureau. Notice to the general public shall also be given by posting in two (2) public places in the
Town of Hollis at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting. The notice will include a description of the
proposal, the name of the applicant, and the location of the proposal. The notice of formal submission may
also include the date, time and place of the general public hearing on the proposal. If the time, date and
place of an adjourned session of any properly noticed public hearing is made known at the hearing,
additional notice for the continuance of the hearing is not required.
All costs of notice for hearings shall be paid, in advance, by the applicant. Failure of the applicant to pay
such costs will constitute grounds for the Board to terminate further consideration of the proposal and
disapprove the plat without a public hearing.
Expedited Review:
1. The Planning Board may, at its discretion, and upon written request of the applicant, hold the
acceptance meeting and the public hearing on the same night. Such expedited review shall be
only for minor subdivisions, which create no more than five (5) building lots or for proposals,
which do not involve the creation of lots for building purposes.
2. No application for expedited review shall be approved without full and proper notice to
abutters and the public as noted above.
F. EXTENSION: The Planning Board may apply to the Selectmen for an extension not to exceed an
additional ninety (90) days before acting to approve or disapprove an application. An applicant may
waive the requirement for Planning Board action within the time periods specified in these regulations and
consent to such extension as may be mutually agreeable.
G. DISAPPROVAL OF APPLICATION: In case of disapproval of any application submitted to the Planning
Board, the ground(s) for such disapproval shall be adequately stated in the records of the Planning Board.
H. FEES: The Planning Board shall impose fees for subdivision procedures in accordance with the approved
fee schedule.
In addition, the Board may impose other fees to cover the administrative expense, including Mylar filing
fees, costs of special investigative studies, review and recording of documents, and other matters, which
may be required by particular applications. Fees for professional planning, engineering, and legal and other
consultant review shall be paid by the applicant. Funds will be collected by the Town of Hollis and held in
a separate escrow account. Any monies remaining at the completion of the review process will be returned
Page 4

appropriate town agency.
All documentation required herein shall be submitted in final, executable, recordable form satisfactory to
the Hollis Town Counsel prior to final approval of a plat by the Planning Board.
J. APPROVAL OF SUBDIVISION PLATS FOR RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS: The Hollis Master
Plan sets forth goals and purposes which focus on maintaining the rural character of the town while
encouraging diversity in the age, social and economic make-up of the population. These goals can only be
accomplished by developments which are:
1. Economically sound in terms of keeping to a minimum additional cost to the town for services
such as new schools, new roads, added police and fire protection and similar services.
2. Not detrimental to the character, environment, scenic value and general welfare of the town.
It is the Hollis Planning Board’s responsibility to guide the orderly growth of the town. Accordingly, the
Board will evaluate the suitability of new subdivisions, guided by the following criteria, which are based on
the goals of the Hollis Master Plan:

permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is
required by Federal or State law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution
Control Act Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C 1334.
Page 6
July 8, 2016
4. The Planning Board shall require that all proposals for development greater than 50 lots or 5
acres, whichever is the lesser, include Base Flood Elevation (BFE) data within such proposals
(i.e. floodplain boundary and 100-year flood elevation).
5. The Planning Board shall require the applicant to submit sufficient evidence (construction
drawings, grading and land treatment plans) so as to allow a determination that:
a. all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
b. all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems are
located and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage; and
c. adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
SECTION IV. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR LAND SUBDIVISION
SECTION IV.1. GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. PUBLIC SAFETY: Land of such a character that it cannot be safely used for building purposes because of
exceptional danger to health or peril from fire, flood, or other menace shall not be platted for residential
occupancy nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health, life or property or aggravate the flood
hazard, until appropriate measures have been taken by the owner or his agent to substantially eliminate
such hazards.
B. SCATTERED OR PREMATURE SUBDIVISION: Scattered or Premature Subdivision of land for
building purposes which would create one of the following conditions shall be prohibited:
1. Danger or injury to health, safety or prosperity by reason of the lack of water supply, drainage,
transportation, schools, fire department or other public services;
2. Necessitate an excessive expenditure of public funds for the supply of such services;
C. ACCESSIBILITY: Spaces of adequate proportions shall be maintained to afford light, air and access for
firefighting apparatus and equipment to buildings. A determination of adequate accessibility will be made
by the Chief of the Fire Department.
D. WETLANDS, SWAMPS AND WATER COURSES: No residential, commercial, or industrial use shall be
platted that requires filling of or destroying of natural wetlands, nor shall natural swamps, potable water
supplies and water courses be destroyed or diverted to provide access to or enlarge adjacent dry land areas
without approval of the appropriate State agencies as well as the Planning Board as per (Reference
Wetlands Ordinance)
E. CONSTRUCTION: No construction shall be permitted in any subdivision in accordance with RSA 149-
E:s (Sewage Disposal Systems) until final approval has been granted by the Planning Board.
F. ADDITIONAL STUDIES: For major subdivisions, the Planning Board may require, as part of the
subdivision application, the submittal of studies to address specific site related impacts. The required
studies may include, but not necessarily be limited to:
a. Environmental Hazard Analysis: An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an assessment of
the possible impact, positive or negative, that a proposed project may have on the natural
environment. It is the process of identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the
biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of development proposals prior to major decisions
being taken and commitments made.
b. Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment: The Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment
(WHIA) shall be completed on site by a wildlife biologist approved by the Hollis Conservation
Commission. In order to complete a thorough inventory and assessment of the habitats and
wildlife on the site, the Planning Board may require that the Wildlife Habitat Inventory and
Assessment be completed over the course of all four seasons. All season assessments may be
necessary to identify unique wildlife areas including, but not limited to: vernal pools, deer
Page 7
July 8, 2016
wintering areas, bird migration stopover habitats, mast production areas utilized by wildlife, and
hibernation sites of bats and other mammals.
The Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment shall include:
?? The subdivision or site plan. The plan shall include total acreage; total proposed developed acres; total
proposed open space acres; and the subdivision or site plan layout. In the case of site plans the layout shall
include the location of any proposed structures; parking lots; roads; driveways and stormwater treatment
facilities. In the case of subdivisions, the plan shall show the locations of any proposed roads; driveways;
house lots and stormwater treatment facilities.
?? A locus map of the site showing surrounding land uses (i.e. residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural,
recreational, conservation, et.al.).
?? Aerial photos showing habitat types, wildlife corridors, wetlands, vernal pools and other key site features
overlaid on the proposed subdivision or site plan.
?? A description of the methodologies used to identify, inventory and assess wildlife habitats and corridors,
wetlands, and vernal pools.
?? A memo from the Natural Heritage Bureau regarding the occurrence of rare, threatened and/or endangered
species of plants and animals on or within the vicinity of the site.
?? An inventory of observed and potential species of plants and animals, especially state-listed species or
those listed in the NH Wildlife Action Plan as species of conservation or management concern. This
inventory should also include indicators (scat, tracks, bird calls, et.al.) of the presence of species not
directly observed.
?? Photos taken during the site visit of the representative habitat types and, if possible, of observed species.
?? A risk assessment of the potential impacts to wildlife and wildlife habitat from the proposed development.
This assessment should include, but not be limited to wetland dredging and/or filling, habitat fragmentation
and non-point source pollution of surface waters (i.e. stormwater runoff). It should also include a
description of the type (positive, negative, neutral) and magnitude of impact, and likely influence on the
long-term sustainability of local populations of each species listed in the inventory.
?? Recommendations to minimize and mitigate the potential impacts.
The completed WHIA Study shall be submitted to the Hollis Conservation Commission and the Hollis Planning
Board for review and comment.
NOTE: The Hollis Conservation Commission and the Hollis Planning Board strongly advises the use of the New
Hampshire Fish and Game Wildlife Action Plan (2005, as revised) as a guide to completing the WHIA Study
Source documents for the compilation of this Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment include:
1. Identifying and Protecting New Hampshire’s Significant Wildlife Habitat: A Guide for Towns and
Conservation Groups, authored by John Kanter, Rebeca Suomala and Ellen Snyder, published by the
Nongame and Endangered Wildlife Program of New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, 2001.
2. New Hampshire Wildlife Action Plan; New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, 2005.
c. Traffic: An analysis of the traffic that will be generated by the proposed development and the
projected impact on the surrounding area. The scoping of this type of study shall be developed in
concert with the Board and other town Departments (Police & DPW). The study scope may
include: peak hour details, key intersection capacity analysis, level of service impacts, anticipated
construction- related traffic, existing and projected traffic counts, and traffic signalization analysis.
d. Stormwater management: An engineering study of both the existing conditions and the methods
for handling storm water runoff during and after the proposed development occurs. The study
shall, at a minimum, include a description of the pre and post developed areas – including any
offsite areas that either are affected by or contribute to the runoff, soils type, ground cover, rainfall
amounts, how the peak rate of flow is to be abated, how the runoff volume is to be maintained and
how or what measures are to be used to treat runoff and control erosion both during construction
and after the site is developed. Each area (study point) where the runoff leaves the site is to be
Page 8
July 8, 2016
analyzed separately. The study shall provide a peak rate of flow and volume of runoff for each
catchment and each study point. A statement shall also be provided as to which other permits
(State & Federal) are required for the project.
e. Fiscal Impact: Provide information pertaining to the fiscal ramifications of a proposed
development project, including projected revenues and expenditures (town & school). For
residential developments, include projected school enrollments, along with a projected time frame
of when these students will enter the school system. As a reference document, housing unit school
age multipliers detailed in “Housing and School Enrollment in NH: An Expanded View,
May/2005”, or as amended, prepared for NHHFA and prepared by AER, Laconia, NH, or the most
up-to-date resource available for such data shall be used to project anticipated school enrollment
impacts. An alternative data source may only be used with prior approval from the Planning
Board. In addition, the fiscal report should detail the Town’s current school capacity. Existing and
past enrollment trends shall be analyzed to gauge the ability of the existing facilities to
accommodate future enrollments anticipated from the proposed project.
f. Visual Impact: A visual impact study shall be submitted for review during the application
process. The visual impact study is a tool to assist the Planning Board and others to see what the
proposed development will look like, usually at its entrance. Except when directed otherwise, all
designed features of the proposed development that are visible from one or more points on the
adjacent public way are to be realistically rendered in perspective view. These features include,
but are not limited to:
?? Proposed grade changes: roads, stormwater management, driveways, slopes, etc;
?? Structures (reasonable architectural representations in anticipated locations) and signage;
?? Landscaping (new plantings should be shown at their relative size within 3-5 years of
planting). No cut zones and other undisturbed areas should also be shown on plans.
?? Aspects unique to the site, or to the application, that the Planning Board may wish to see
depicted.
The rendering may be hand-drawn, 2- or 3-D CAD, a digitally-altered photograph, a scale
model, or a combination of such images.
g. Historical Significance Documentation: As part of EPA’s National Pollution Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit program, which is now required for any project that disturbs
an area of one (1) acre or more, the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources must be
contacted. If the site is noted as potentially historically significant based on their data sources,
NHDHR will determine if additional on-site studies are necessary. If, based upon local
knowledge, a project is proposed in an area of a known historical resource, the Planning Board
may require an applicant to undertake an archeological study to determine the extent of the
resource and what impact could occur from the proposed development. The exact scope of the
study shall be determined through discussions with the applicant and the historical consultant.
The Planning Board may also request the assistance from the Hollis Heritage Commission to
obtain input and advice.
After determining which studies may be necessary for application acceptance, the Planning Board reserves
the right to amend or reverse such decision and require additional studies when, in the course of the review
process, it deems it necessary to require the same in order to properly evaluate the development proposal.
SECTION IV.2. DESIGN REQUIREMENTS
A. Proposed subdivisions shall conform to the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town of Hollis.
Lot areas and frontage shall conform to the requirements of the district in which the subdivision is located.
Where new lots and lot lines are created, resulting lot shapes shall be reasonable and compact.
Page 9
July 8, 2016
Easements and rights-of-way shall not be counted in the determination of buildable area of a lot or tract,
whether it is proposed for subdivision or not.
B. Slope and drainage easements are to be provided as required prior to final approval.
C. Pavement and drainage facilities, curbs and sidewalks, when required, shall be installed and constructed in
accordance with the standard specifications of the Town of Hollis, and in all cases must be constructed
under the supervision of the Director of Public Works or designee.
D. The reservation of strips of land which, in the opinion of the Board, show an intent on the part of the
subdivider to control access to land dedicated or to be dedicated to public use shall not be permitted.
E. The distance between two essentially paralleling streets defining a block shall not be less than four hundred
feet.
F. Permanent monuments shall be set at all principal corners and as required by the Director of Public Works
or designee at locations shown on the approved plats. The subdivider or his agent shall be responsible for
placing all monuments to be set. No new streets will be accepted by the Town prior to the setting of all
required bounds. All lot corners shall be set prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.
G. Property lines shall be perpendicular to street line one hundred (100) feet back from the street.
SECTION IV.3. PERFORMANCE GUARANTY
A. Estimate of Cost
Prior to the recording of a plat by the Planning Board, the Applicant or owner shall obtain from their
engineer an estimate of the cost of construction of all improvements including site stabilization and
erosion control and revegetation plan (if required), which shall be required by the Board as a condition of
final approval up to the standards set forth in these Regulations. The applicants engineer shall calculate
the performance guaranty estimate which will then be reviewed and approved by the Town’s Consulting
Engineer/Inspector.
B. Posting of Performance Guaranty
As a condition of the approval of a plat by the Board, the Applicant shall provide the Town with a
performance guaranty to assure the Town of the completion of improvements required under
these Regulations and repair of potential damage to existing public improvements.
The construction of a new proposed road may proceed under one of two scenarios:
a. After posting an adequate performance guaranty to cover the cost of site stabilization and erosion
control, road construction may proceed but no building permits shall be issued. Building permits
will be issued once all remaining improvements have been secured by a performance guaranty.
In no case shall a Certificate of Occupancy be issued until such time the binder course of
pavement has been satisfactorily installed.
b. The complete performance guaranty covering all required improvements including landscaping (if
required) is posted and in full effect prior to any construction of any improvements. Building
permits shall not be issued until an acceptable Performance Guaranty has been submitted and
Certificate of Occupancies shall not be issued until such time the binder course of pavement has
been satisfactorily installed.
Failure to maintain proper completion assurances shall result in the denial of a Certificate of
Occupancy and the revocation of all building permits outstanding for the subdivision.
C. Form of Security
Page 10
July 8, 2016
The performance guaranty shall be in the form of a bond issued by a financially responsible surety
company registered and licensed to do business in the State of New Hampshire, a self calling letter of
credit or other collateral or surety arrangement, all in form and substance satisfactory to the Planning
Board, or a cash escrow, or a savings bank deposit book properly endorsed to the Town and deposited
with it. The Town’s Attorney shall review all performance guaranty documents, other than cash, to ensure
the proposed document language protects the Town’s interests.
D. Term
1. The performance guaranty shall remain in full effect until the completion of all required
improvements and repair of all damages to public improvements in accordance with the
provisions of these Regulations
2. The amount of the guaranty may be reduced during the course of construction when portions of the
required improvements have been satisfactorily installed, provided that in no case shall the Security be
less than 10% of the total original full road performance guaranty estimate.
3. Release of the final Performance Guarantee shall be requested in writing by the Applicant to the
Planning Department and the Town’s Consulting Engineer, with the Planning Board and the Board of
Selectmen approving such release.
E. Default
If the required improvements and repairs to public improvements have not been installed and
completed in accordance with the requirements of these Regulations or if any latent defects in
such improvements or repairs appearing have not been corrected as required, then the Town shall be
entitled to exercise its rights under the appropriate documents to require the surety or issuer of the letter
of credit to provide the Town with sufficient funds to complete such work.
F. Road Maintenance
The Applicant/owner of the subdivision project shall be fully responsible for all costs associated
with maintaining the proposed town road until such time all work have been satisfactorily
performed to town standards and accepted as a town road.
SECTION IV.4. SEWAGE DISPOSAL SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
In areas not currently served by public sewer systems it shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or his agent to
provide:
A. Adequate information (from test pits and percolation tests) to prove that the land and area of each lot is
adequate to permit the installation and operation of an individual sewage disposal system. Such
information shall be in accordance with the provisions of RSA 149-E, as amended, and approval obtained
from the Town of Hollis and the New Hampshire Water Supply and Pollution Control Commission.
B. In addition to the requirements of RSA 149-E, and where ledge and high seasonal water tables are
involved, at least four (4) feet of in-place soil shall exist above ledge or any other impermeable strata and
two (2) feet of in-place soil shall exist above the seasonal high water mark before the fill. In the Aquifer
Protection Overlay Zone, at least four (4) feet of in-place soil shall exist above the seasonal high water
Page 11
July 8, 2016
table before fill, and the bottom of the leaching field shall be at least six (6) feet above the seasonal high
water table. The subdivider or his agent shall be required to provide the necessary equipment and labor for
the making of these tests. The Planning Board shall have the right to require re-testing, if necessary.
SECTION IV.5. FIRE PROTECTION REQUIREMENTS
A. Any water supply constructed or upgraded for the purpose of fire protection shall be approved by the
Planning Board after review by the Fire Department. All major subdivisions will require a cistern to be
installed, inspected and operational at a location and time predetermined by the Fire Department. It is the
goal of the Fire Department to have access to a reliable water source that is no more than 2,500 feet from
any residential development. In the case that a cistern is already in adequate close proximity to a major
subdivision, the Fire Department will establish the necessity of another cistern. For minor subdivisions, a
$7,500.00 (seven thousand five hundred) contribution per lot must be made towards the installation of a
cistern at issuance of certificate of occupancy. The determination of the development of a cistern or a
monetary contribution will be the responsibility of the Planning Board under advisement from the Fire
Department.
B. A dry hydrant connected to the water supply shall be provided and located so as to be readily accessible to
a town street. The dry hydrant shall be located no further than twenty (20) feet from the traveled way of
the street and shall be no higher than twelve (12) feet in vertical height above the season low water
elevation.
C. Fire ponds shall be entirely enclosed by fencing of a coasted chain link design, the height of which shall be
five (5) feet. A swing or sliding gate of sufficient size to permit maintenance vehicular entry and which
shall be secured in the closed position by a lock, a key to which shall be provided to the Hollis Fire
Department, shall be provided to permit access for any necessary maintenance.
D. During the application review process, if the Planning Board, in consultation with the Fire Department,
determines that the installation of a fire cistern will be necessary at some future time to protect the public’s
health, safety and welfare, then the Board may require that an appropriate easement area on the subject
property be provided to allow for such future installation by the Town.
SECTION IV.6. OPEN SPACE REQUIREMENTS
A. In designing a subdivision, the subdivider shall show due regard for all natural features such as large trees,
water courses, scenic points, historic spots and other community assets which, if preserved, will enhance
the value of the subdivision and enrich the neighborhood.
B. One suitably located, buildable area shall be set aside as a park or playground equal to one (1) acre for
every sixteen (16) house lots or major portion thereof, or five percent (5%) of the total area subdivided,
whichever is larger. Area set aside for parks and playgrounds shall be dedicated to public use or reserved
for the common use of all property owners in the subdivision by covenant in the deed. Whenever such
dedication of land is required, the land shall be left in natural state, clear of construction debris. The
Planning Board may consult with the Recreation and Conservation Commissions as to the suitability of
proposed park or playground areas.
SECTION IV.7. MINIMUM ROAD STANDARDS – (SEE ROAD STANDARDS SECTION.)
To help preserve the natural character of the Hollis landscape, new subdivision streets and driveways shall
be logically located with respect to the topography of the site to minimize cuts and fills, and to provide for
reasonable grades and safe intersections. New streets and driveways shall not be located where cuts or fills
would have to exceed 4 feet in depth, as measured from the roadway/driveway centerline to the existing
natural grade, for any consecutive distance exceeding 150 feet along the length of the street/driveway. Cuts
or fills that do exceed 4 feet shall be limited to one occurrence for every 1000 feet along the length of the
street/driveway. In addition, streets and driveways shall not be located where the natural slope of the land,
averaged over any 150 foot length, would need to be changed by more than 5 percent in order to achieve
the maximum grade standard for new streets or driveways, as applicable. The applicant shall demonstrate
that driveway access from the lot’s Frontage can be provided to the Building Area, as defined in the Zoning
Ordinance, without the need for any waivers from this provision.

SECTION IV.8. VISUAL IMPACT IMPLEMENTATION
In reviewing a proposed subdivision plan the Planning Board may request a Visual Impact Study be
undertaken. This Study would confirm the proposed projects compliance with the Rural Character
Preservation Ordinance. In cases where re-vegetation or plantings are required the following
requirements/standards shall be adhered to:
a. During the subdivision plan review process, the Applicant shall outline and clearly note on the plan the
specific timing of when all required re-vegetation or plantings will be installed. If a new town road is
proposed, all buffering shall be installed as soon as the initial road (binder course) & drainage work is
completed. If re-vegetation or plantings are required as a condition of a subdivision that does not involve a
new town road, then landscaping shall be installed prior to the issuance of a building permit or an alternative
installation time table agreed to by the Planning Board.
b. As part of the landscaping plan details, the Applicant shall note all loam replacement needs, a watering
schedule once the plants are installed and a maintenance plan detailing inspections over at least a two – three
year growing season. Weed management and mulch details shall be included as necessary.
c. Prior to any site development, an itemized list of all plantings, quantities and cost per item, along with loam
and watering costs shall be submitted from a reputable landscaping company for review and approval by the
Planning Board or its designee. All required re-vegetation or plantings shall be secured by a Performance
Guaranty following the Requirements for Landscape Performance Guaranties outline that is a component of
the Town’s Subdivision Bond Estimate Form. If a new road is proposed, then the cost of all landscaping
shall be included in the total amount of the security.

SECTION IV.7. ROAD and DRIVEWAY DESIGN STANDARDS
1. The purpose of these standards is to ensure safe vehicular and pedestrian travel on streets, whether public
or private. Proper design requires the integration of safe roadway layout and grade with minimization of
impacts to the existing terrain and the environment. These standards are also intended to be flexible in
consideration of various traffic volumes and environmental conditions.
A. Street Arrangement
1. All subdivisions shall have adequate provision for safe and suitable access to a Class V or better road or shall
make provisions for the construction and dedication of a Class V or better road in order to obtain safe and
suitable access to the subdivision. The arrangement of streets in the subdivision shall provide for the
continuation of the principal streets in adjoining subdivisions or for their proper projection when adjoining
property is not subdivided. The minimum right-of-way should be 50’ in width.
B. Hammerheads and Cul-de-sacs

Road names will be chosen from historical records of past Hollis residents that lived in the area. The names
will be subject to approval by the Hollis Board of Selectmen. The Fire Chief and Police Chief will be consulted
to avoid duplication or phonetic resemblance. All extensions of existing streets must bear the name of the
original.
2. Private drives containing more than two (2) dwellings will be named to comply with E-911 requirements.
These names will be chosen from the historic records of past Hollis residents, however first names will be used
with the designation “Way”.
3. The Planning Board will inform the applicant of the name chosen prior to final approval of the plat.
D. Bonding
1. For a common driveway a bond will be posted prior to a building permit being issued.
2. In circumstances where public health and safety could potentially be compromised, emergency responses by the
Department of Public Works crews shall be charged to the owner/developer and shall be added to the bond.
E. Minimum Road Design Standards
The construction of new streets shall only be permitted for subdivisions creating a minimum of four (4) lots total.
The total lots shall include any lot containing an existing house, and all proposed back lots. Roads shall be a
minimum of two hundred (200) feet in length, excluding hammerheads, and shall be laid out in conformance with
the recommendations of the Master Plan and as required by the Subdivision Regulations.

*NOTE: The Planning Board is empowered to require:
1. a greater than fifty (50) foot right-of-way; and/or
2. a slope or road maintenance agreement
These additional requirements would be imposed by the Planning Board, at its
discretion, in order to
1. accommodate required grading;
2. maintain adequate clearance from existing structures; and
3. require an alternative road location.
2) New streets shall slope away from the edge of the existing travel lane between 2 and 3 percent for
a minimum distance of 20 feet to provide a vehicle platform.
F. Cut and Fill-Side Slopes
1. Roads in Cut and Fill. Side slopes must be finished grade no steeper than two (2) feet horizontal and one (1)
foot vertical (2:1). Ditches on both sides of right-of-way shall be a minimum of twenty-four (24) inches below
centerline of finished pavement and graded so as to prevent “ponding” of water. All slopes must be stabilized
so as to prevent erosion. Slopes must be stabilized with loam and seed or through the use of “mulch and seed”
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
2016
in acceptable soil types or at the discretion of the Public Works Director or designee. All seeded areas shall
have no less than four (4) inches of humus-type soil and be seeded with a mixture that will produce at least one
hundred (100) plants per square foot. Any part of the seeded area which fails to produce a uniform stand will be
reseeded until all areas are covered with grass.
2. Limits to Cut and Fill. To help preserve the natural character of the Hollis landscape, new subdivision streets
and driveways shall be logically located with respect to the topography of the site to minimize cuts and fills, and
to provide for reasonable grades and safe intersections. New streets and driveways shall not be located where
cuts or fills would exceed four (4) feet in depth, as measured from the roadway/driveway centerline to the
existing natural grade, for any consecutive distance exceeding one hundred and fifty (150) feet along the length
of the street/driveway. Cuts or fills that do exceed four (4) feet shall be limited to one (1) occurrence for every
1,000 feet along the length of the street/driveway. In addition, streets and driveways shall not be located where
the natural slope of the land, averaged over any 150 foot length, would need to be changed by more than five
(5) percent in order to achieve the maximum grade standard for new streets or driveways, as applicable. The
maximum disturbed width of land associated with the construction of a road or driveway shall not exceed 100
feet. Retaining walls shall not be used to reduce the area of disturbance.
G. Signage
The Department of Public Works shall provide street sign posts and signs for new or extended streets at all new
intersections. All costs associated with street signs shall be charged back to the developer.
H. Design Standards for Driveways and Other Accesses to the Public Way
In as much as driveways and entrances are, in effect, intersections, they require certain controls as to size, location
and construction in order to provide safe and efficient access to property fronting on the public way, as well as
surface drainage in and around said driveway, and for the purpose of such control this regulation is enacted.
Pursuant to the authority vested in the Hollis Planning Board in accordance with the provisions of RSA 236:13 New
Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, as amended, the Hollis Planning Board adopts the following regulations
governing driveways and other accesses to the public way in the Town of Hollis, New Hampshire.
1. Permit. Anyone desiring to construct, alter, repair, repave or relocate a driveway in order to obtain access to an
existing public way or a proposed street or public way, shall first apply for and obtain a permit from the Public
Works Director or his designee. This permit shall provide for the construction, alteration, repair, repaving, or
relocation of such driveway in accordance with the specifications provided in the Guidelines for Driveway
Construction, in Appendix B.
Said permit shall:
a. Describe the location of the driveway, entrance, exit or approach. The location shall be selected to most
adequately protect the safety of the traveling public.
b. Describe any drainage structures, traffic control devices and channelization islands to be installed.
c. Establish grades that adequately protect and promote highway drainage and permit a safe and controlled
approach to the highway in all seasons of the year.
d. Include any other terms and specifications necessary for the safety or the traveling public.
Permanent house numbers will be assigned by the Department of Public Works at the time the driveway permit
is issued.
2. Access Points.
a. If a property is adjacent to a side road the access to the main road should be via the side road.
b. Curb cuts shall be limited to one per residential lot, except where the Planning Board has determined that a
second cut is warranted. A scale drawing indicating the features necessitating the second access must be
submitted for the Planning Board to make a determination. A second curb cut may be granted under the
following conditions:
1) A second curb cut is necessary for access to a secondary use or structure, and the physical constraints
of the lot, including natural features, unusual lot shape or size, or elevation change necessitates the
second access.
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
2016
2) A second curb cut is necessary to allow for handicapped access for an individual who is a permanent
resident of the property.
3) A permit is required from the Department of Public Works for temporary access entrance. A bond in
the amount of $1,500 shall be required to guarantee restoration of the area disturbed by the temporary
access.
c. Street areas and the public right-of-way shall be cleared daily of debris such as mud, stone, construction
vehicles and equipment.
d. Common driveways are allowed to access up to two (2) lots. The common driveway must measure twenty
(20) feet of hard surface, including shoulders. A waiver by the Planning Board is required to access three
(3) or more lots with a common driveway. Common driveways must also meet Town of Hollis Guidelines
for Driveway Construction included in Appendix B.
e. The driveway location as indicated on the approved septic plan is the ONLY driveway to be utilized unless
a change is authorized in writing by the Public Works Director or designee. (Emphasis Added).
f. No more than two (2) driveways to a single commercial or industrial establishment entering on a single
highway shall be permitted unless frontage along said highway exceeds five hundred (500) feet.
g. At new street intersections, the Town shall not permit more than one (1) access to a single parcel of land
unless all-season safe sight distance in both directions along the highway can be obtained.
h. To prevent hardships to owners of small parcels of land or special land uses, exceptions to the sight
distance requirements should be allowed for individual homes, agricultural land, public works land,
highway department land, and temporary accesses for vehicles such as construction vehicles, gravel trucks
and log trucks. The road should then be properly signed for “Blind Drive” or “Trucks Entering.”
i. All new driveways must have an all-season sight distance depending on the speed limit of the area.
3. Design Requirements.
The proposed use and layout will be of such a nature that it will make vehicular or pedestrian traffic no more
hazardous than is normal for the area involved. Factors for the Planning Board to consider in this determination
include: turning movements in relation to traffic flow, proximity to and relationship to intersections, adequacy
of sight distances, location and access of off-street parking and pedestrian traffic. To satisfy these requirements
the applicant may be required to improve existing connecting roads at no expense to the Town.
a. The design of the proposed driveway construction shall conform in all aspects to the Town of Hollis, NH
Driveway Permit: Typical Driveway Sections schematic reference in Appendix B. It is understood that the
applicant shall confer with the Public Works Director, or designee, who shall determine specifications as to
sloping, culverts, and other aspects of construction of said driveway only when it deviates from the typical
profile and standards. The deviations shall be noted in writing on the Driveway Permit. Upon written
application, the Public Works Director, or designee, may waive any of the design requirements when it is
shown that strict compliance would cause undue or unnecessary hardship, so long as such waiver shall not
result in any injury to the public health or welfare.
b. Where frontage exceeds five hundred (500) feet, no more than three (3) driveways or approaches will be
permitted. For proposed developments with frontage, which exceeds five hundred (500) feet, the
construction of internal street systems or service roads outside of the highway right-of-way is necessary to
provide greater safety for the development, as well as the highway users.
c. The maximum width of any driveway shall be fifty (50) feet except that a driveway, entrance, exit, or
approach may be flared beyond a width of fifty (50) feet at its junction with the highway to accommodate
the turning radius of vehicles expected to use the particular driveway, entrance, exit, or approach. The
maximum width of any one-way entrance or exit driveway to a divided highway or one-way street shall not
exceed thirty-five (35) feet measured parallel to the highway or street centerline at the curb or ditchline
except that such driveway, entrance, exit, or approach may be flared beyond a width of thirty-five (35) feet
at its junction with the highway.
d. The angle of the driveway with respect to the pavement edge shall not be less than sixty degrees (60º) with
desirable range between sixty degrees (60º) and ninety degrees (90º) except that a smaller angle may be
used for entrance driveways along a divided highway, permitting only one-way operation of the driveway.
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
2016
e. Return radii for driveways shall not exceed fifty (50) feet, nor be less than fifteen (15) feet.
f. It is recommended that a minimum of fifteen (15) feet be provided between the right-of-way line and the
near edge of any service facility. In any event, this distance should be sufficient so that no vehicles will be
serviced on state property or use any portion of the island area.
g. All mailboxes will be placed as stated in the Town of Hollis, NH Driveway Permit Application, Appendix
B.
h. Flat driveway side-slopes (4:1 to 6:1) are required to minimize hazards to vehicles which leave the
pavement for any reason. All paved roads shall require an asphalt apron from the town or to the property
line, said apron being constructed of a minimum of three (3) inches of asphalt with emulsion applied at the
joint with the town road.
i. All new driveways established to serve structures intended for human occupancy shall have a maximum
grade of eight (8) percent. The purpose of the maximum grade requirement is to ensure public safety and
accessibility for emergency vehicles. This standard shall not apply to driveways intended to serve nonoccupancy
structures, such as utility service buildings, and other private ways intended for purposes such as
logging, silviculture, agriculture, and recreational access.
j. Where required, culverts shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) inches in diameter and shall be constructed of
reinforced concrete, high density polyethylene or approved equal.
k. This access shall be at the location the Planning Board determines to be the safest. All-season safe sight
distance is defined as a line which encounters no visual obstruction between two (2) points, each at a height
of three (3) feet nine (9) inches above the pavement, and ten (10) feet back from the road pavement as to
represent the critical line of sight between the operator of a vehicle using the access and the operator of a
vehicle approaching from either direction.
Safe sight distance shall be compatible with the maximum speed limit posted on the road.
SPEED LIMIT (mph) SIGHT DISTANCE (feet)
0-39 200
40-49 300
50 + 400
l. Parking, loading, or servicing of vehicles shall not take place on the highway right-of-way. No structures
including permanent or portable buildings, signs, lights, displays, fences, walls, sanitary facilities, shall be
permitted on, over or under the highway right-of-way limits.
m. At rural intersections, the minimum distance between the nearest edge of the driveway and the crossroad
edge of pavement, measure along the edge of pavement, shall be one hundred (100) feet for both the major
and minor routes. The Public Works Director, or designee, shall have the authority to increase these
distance if, in his opinion, such action is necessary for the protection of traffic.
n. Driveway configuration should be located to accommodate snow removal at the discretion of the Public
Works Director, or designee.
4. Easement and Bond.
a. The applicant shall, at the discretion of the Public Works Director or designee, be required as a condition of
the granting of the Driveway Permit, to provide to the Town of Hollis, its successors or assigns, an
easement for the purpose of entering upon the premises of the applicant to control or maintain surface
drainage on the property and do all things necessary for, and incidental to, such drainage easement in
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
SUBDIVISION REGULATIONS
2016
question.
b. Furthermore, and where appropriate and necessary, in the opinion of the Public Works Director, or
designee, the applicant may be required to provide a bond of a minimum of $1,500, or an amount necessary
as security for the proper construction of any culverts, piping, ditching or other efforts incidental to and
necessary for the proper discharge and control of surface drainage in and around the vicinity of the
proposed driveway as well as the proper construction of the driveway entrance both on the property of the
applicant or on the property of the Town of Hollis.
c. The purpose of this provision is to control the construction of the driveway to the extent that it may impact
any town road and/or town right-of-way. An additional purpose is the extent to which the construction of
the driveway on the property of the applicant shall interfere with, impede or in any way affect surface
drainage so as to create a need for the Town to regulate the same.
d. Failure to begin construction within six (6) months of application will render the driveway permit null and
void. Failure to complete construction within one (1) calendar year from date of posting of bond shall
result in the automatic calling of same unless extended by the Public Works Director, or designee.
e. Funds may be withdrawn from the bond by the Town of Hollis and applied against the cost of said
construction which the Town of Hollis is obliged to complete. No funds shall be expended at any site in
excess of the amount of the bond pertaining to said site.
5. State Approvals.
It shall be the responsibility of the subdivider or individual lot owner to obtain state approval for proposed
driveways and other accesses to the public way which access a Class I, II, or III highway. Such approval shall
be in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 236, Section 13, New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated,
as amended. (Effective July 1, 1981, Routes 111, 111A, 122, 130, Depot Road and West Hollis Road are Class
II highways. There are no Class I or III highways in the Town of Hollis.)
I. Monuments
Permanent monuments shall be set at all principal corners and as required at the locations shown on the approved
plats. The subdivider or his agent shall be responsible for placing all monuments to be set. No new streets will be
accepted by the Town prior to the setting of all required bounds.
J. Drainage Easements
When required for the drainage of an area to be subdivided or otherwise developed, drainage easements shall be of
such dimensions as are necessary to permit proper construction, access and maintenance of drainage facilities based
on the drainage system of the area. The relationship between the type of drainage system and minimum width of the
easement shall be considered and plans shall show the boundaries of proposed easements over or under private
property.
K. Conditional Road Acceptance
No road shall be conditionally accepted by the Town of Hollis during the period between November 1st through
May 1st. Conditional road acceptance will be subject to the criteria for substantial completion of roadways listed
below. The purpose of the conditional road acceptance is to provide winter maintenance (which includes plowing,
sanding, salting and road sweeping) to a subdivision prior to the final completion of all improvements. All road
repairs and other maintenance required (other than winter maintenance) shall be the responsibility of the
owner/developer until the end of the one (1) year maintenance period and after final approval. Roads will only be
accepted after a public hearing and approval, in writing, by the Hollis Board of Selectmen.
1. All roadway and utility improvements shall be installed and approved up to and including binder grade (base
coat of asphalt).
2. All drainage structures shall be installed, functional and to binder grade to facilitate winter maintenance.
3. All guardrails and required curbing shall be installed and approved.
4. Fire cisterns and public safety items shall be installed and approved.

M. Final Road Acceptance
After final approval the road will be bonded and maintained (except for winter maintenance and sweeping) by the
developer for one full year before being eligible for town acceptance.
N. Traffic Impact Study
1. Subdivision location may necessitate a traffic impact study. Professional guidance may be requested by the
Planning Board in judging acceptability of street site distances, access and egress locations, traffic control and
potential traffic problems.
O. Scenic Roads
1. The road design requirements adopted pursuant to this section shall be the same standards for all roads which
have been declared by the Town to be “Scenic Roads” according to the provisions of RSA 231:157 and 158 and
as listed below. The standards shall protect the features of the scenic road right-of-way that contribute to the
scenic character of the road when necessary road improvements are made.

conformance to the specifications contained in the Site Plan Regulations, the presentation of all required drawings,
layouts, reports or other technical data, the payment of all fees that may be imposed by the Board in accordance with
their fee schedule and the names and addresses of abutters (confirmed within five days of filing) as indicated in town
records on the Submission Date designated by the Planning Board. . The Board may waive one or more provisions
of Section III.2, below, when appropriate, but only upon written request as provided for is Section 1M..
B. DRAWING. Five (5) prints of all drawings to be recorded shall be included with the completed application. In
addition, one print of topography and road profiles is required. Prior to approval the mylar of all drawings to be
recorded shall be submitted.
C. ACCEPTANCE OF APPLICATION. The Board will accept a complete application only at a public meeting of the
Board. Applicant must file application with the Board at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the meeting at
which it is to be accepted.
D. REVIEW PERIOD. A sixty-five (65) day review period begins on the date of the meeting at which the application
is formally accepted by the Board. The Board must begin formal consideration of the application within thirty (30)
days “of submitted application”. If the Board fails to act on the application within the sixty-five (65) day period, the
applicant may either apply to the Selectmen for an order directing the Board to act within thirty (30) days of the
issuance of the order or consent to an extension of the sixty-five (65) day review period. If the Selectmen do issue
an order and the Board fails to act, the applicant has grounds to petition the superior court for an order approving the
application. If consensual extensions of the review period are desired by the applicant or the Board, a statement
detailing the conditions of the extension must be signed by both the applicant and the Board and attached to the
application.
E. PUBLIC NOTICES AND HEARINGS. Abutters and applicant will be notified by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of the date of the meeting at which the application will be formally submitted to the Board for acceptance.

Board may impose fees to cover administrative expenses, costs of special investigative studies, review of documents
and other matters which may be required by particular applications.
I. (1) OPTIONAL PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW. The Board recognizes the desirability of being able to meet with
a potential applicant prior to the submission of a formal application to discuss the concepts of a proposal. This
preliminary consultation will occur only at public meetings of the Board, will be non-binding and will discuss the
proposal in conceptual form only.
(2) REQUIRED PRE-APPLICATION REVIEW. In appropriate circumstances when the scope of the impact of
the proposed application warrants, the Planning Board may require an applicant to participate in a preliminary
conceptual consultation phase and/or design review phase (Pursuant to RSA 676:4II) prior to consideration of any
application for acceptance pursuant to RSA 676:4Ib).
J. PERFORMANCE BONDS. Where any plat provides for construction of improvements, installations for facilities,
including but not limited to streets, water, sewer or utility mains, pipes or connections which shall be subject to
provisions of these regulations governing the manner in which they shall be laid out, installed or constructed, the
Planning Board may make final approval of a plat otherwise found to be in conformance with these regulations; but
the Planning Board shall require of the applicant, prior to granting of such final approval, security for the
performance of such work, as follows:
1. The applicant shall provide a bond in such amount considered by the Selectmen to be sufficient to fund the
completion of all such improvements, installations or facilities in conformance with the plat and applicable
regulations. Such bond shall be payable to the Town of Hollis and shall be in such form and shall have such
security as the Selectmen shall deem necessary.
K. INSPECTION, APPROVAL AND ACCEPTANCE OF IMPROVEMENTS, INSTALLATIONS OR
FACILITIES. Upon purported completion by an applicant of construction of improvements, installations or
facilities, subject to the provisions of a Performance Bonds as noted above, the applicant shall make application to
the Selectmen for the approval of construction of such improvements, installations or facilities, and release of the
bond. Within ten (10) days following such application, the Selectmen shall notify the Town Engineer to inspect said
improvements, installations or facilities and to make a report forthwith to the Selectmen. Upon receipt of the Town
Engineer's report, but in no case later than thirty (30) days following submission of the application, the Selectmen
shall act to approve or disapprove such construction. In the event of disapproval of such construction, the Selectmen
shall make such disapproval in writing and state the reasons for such disapproval.
In the event of approval of such construction, the bond shall be released and discharged, but the applicant shall, if
required by the Selectmen, guarantee the quality and workmanship of the improvements, installations and facilities
for a period of one (1) year. The Selectmen may require the provision of a bond, payable to the Town of Hollis, in
approved form, with sufficient securities, to provide security for maintenance of said improvements, installations
and facilities for the one (1) year period. Upon the expiration of the one (1) year period, the maintenance bond shall
be discharged, and the portion of security unused or unnecessary to effect pending maintenance shall be returned to
the applicant.
The Selectmen may, at their option, following approval of any improvements, installations or facilities, require the
delivery to the Selectmen of deeds or other instruments necessary to effect conveyance from the applicant to the
Town of Hollis of any interest in and to any such improvements, installations or facilities.
ADDITIONAL STUDIES: For any site plan proposal, the Planning Board may require, as part of the application, the
submittal of studies to address specific site related impacts. The required studies may include, but not necessarily be limited
to:
1. Environmental Hazard Analysis: An environmental impact assessment (EIA) is an assessment of the possible
impact, positive or negative, that a proposed project may have on the natural environment. It is the process of
identifying, predicting, evaluating and mitigating the biophysical, social, and other relevant effects of
development proposals prior to major decisions being taken and commitments made.
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
SITE PLAN REGULATIONS

July 8, 2016
2. Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment: The Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment (WHIA) shall be
completed on site by a wildlife biologist approved by the Hollis Conservation Commission. In order to
complete a thorough inventory and assessment of the habitats and wildlife on the site, the Planning Board may
require that the Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment be completed over the course of all four seasons. All
season assessments may be necessary to identify unique wildlife areas including, but not limited to: vernal
pools, deer wintering areas, bird migration stopover habitats, mast production areas utilized by wildlife, and
hibernation sites of bats and other mammals.
The Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment shall include:
The subdivision or site plan. The plan shall include total acreage; total proposed developed acres; total proposed
open space acres; and the sudivision or site plan layout. In the case of site plans the layout shall include the location
of any proposed structures; parking lots; roads; driveways and stormwater treatment facilities. In the case of
subdivisions, the plan shall show the locations of any proposed roads; driveways; house lots and stormwater
treatment facilities.
A locus map of the site showing surrounding land uses (i.e. residential, commercial, industrial, agricultural,
recreational, conservation, et.al.).
Aerial photos showing habitat types, wildlife corridors, wetlands, vernal pools and other key site features overlaid
on the proposed subdivision or site plan.
A description of the methodologies used to identify, inventory and assess wildlife habitats and corridors, wetlands,
and vernal pools.
A memo from the Natural Heritage Bureau regarding the occurrence of rare, threatened and/or endangered species of
plants and animals on or within the vicinity of the site.
An inventory of observed and potential species of plants and animals, especially state-listed species or those listed in
the NH Wildlife Action Plan as species of conservation or management concern. This inventory should also include
indicators (scat, tracks, bird calls, et.al.) of the presence of species not directly observed.
Photos taken during the site visit of the representative habitat types and, if possible, of observed species.
A risk assessment of the potential impacts to wildlife and wildlife habitat from the proposed development. This
assessment should include, but not be limited to wetland dredging and/or filling, habitat fragmentation and non-point
source pollution of surface waters (i.e. stormwater runoff). It should also include a description of the type (positive,
negative, neutral) and magnitude of impact, and likely influence on the long-term sustainability of local populations
of each species listed in the inventory.
Recommendations to minimize and mitigate the potential impacts.
The completed WHIA Study shall be submitted to the Hollis Conservation Commission and the Hollis Planning Board for
review and comment.
NOTE: The Hollis Conservation Commission and the Hollis Planning Board strongly advises the use of the New Hampshire
Fish and Game Wildlife Action Plan (2005, as revised) as a guide to completing the WHIA Study
Source documents for the compilation of this Wildlife Habitat Inventory and Assessment include:
1. Identifying and Protecting New Hampshire’s Significant Wildlife Habitat: A Guide for Towns and Conservation
Groups, authored by John Kanter, Rebeca Suomala and Ellen Snyder, published by the Nongame and Endangered
Wildlife Program of New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, 2001.
2. New Hampshire Wildlife Action Plan; New Hampshire Fish and Game Department, 2005.
3. Traffic: An analysis of the traffic that will be generated by the proposed development and the projected impact
on the surrounding area. The scoping of this type of study shall be developed in concert with the Planning
Board and other Town Departments (Police & DPW). The study scope may include: peak hour details, key
intersection capacity analysis, level of service impacts, anticipated constructed related traffic, existing and
projected traffic counts, and traffic signalization analysis.
4. Stormwater management: An engineering study of both the existing conditions and the methods for handling
stormwater runoff during and after the proposed development occurs. The study shall, at a minimum, include a
description of the pre and post developed areas – including any offsite areas that either are affected by or
contribute to the runoff, soils type, ground cover, rainfall amounts, how the peak rate of flow is to be abated,
TOWN OF HOLLIS, NH
SITE PLAN REGULATIONS
Page 5
July 8, 2016
how the runoff volume is to be maintained and how or what measures are to be used to treat runoff and control
erosion both during construction and after the site is developed. Each area (study point) where the runoff leaves
the site is to be analyzed separately. The study shall provide a peak rate of flow and volume of runoff for each
catchment and each study point. A statement should also be provided as to whether other permits (State &
Federal) are required for the project.
5. Fiscal Impact: Provide information pertaining to the fiscal ramifications of a proposed development project,
including projected revenues and expenditures (town & school). For residential developments, include
projected school enrollments, along with a projected time frame of when these students will impact the school
system. As a reference document, housing unit school age multipliers detailed in “Housing and School
Enrollment in NH: an Expanded View, may/2005, or as amended, prepared for NHHFA and prepared by:
AER, Laconia, NH, or the most up-to-date resource available for such data” shall be used to project anticipated
school enrollment impacts. An alternative data source may only be used with prior approval from the Planning
Board. In addition, the fiscal report should detail the Town’s current school capacity. Existing and past
enrollment trends shall be analyzed to gauge the ability of the existing facilities to accommodate future
enrollments anticipated from the proposed project.
6. Visual Impact: A visual impact study shall be submitted for review during the application process. The visual
impact study is a tool to assist the Planning Board and others to see what the proposed development will look
like, usually at its entrance. Except when directed otherwise, all designed features of the proposed development
that are visible from one or more points on the adjacent public way are to be realistically rendered in
perspective view. These features include, but are not limited to:
Proposed grade changes: roads, stormwater management, driveways, slopes, etc:
Structures (reasonable architectural representations in anticipated locations) and signage;
Landscaping (new plantings should be shown at their relative size within 3-5 years of planting). No cut
zones and other undisturbed areas should also be shown on plans.
Aspects unique to the site, or to the application, that the Planning Board may wish to see depicted.
The rendering may be hand-drawn, 2- or 3-D CAD, a digitally-altered photograph, a scale model, or a
combination of such images.
7. Historical Significance Documentation: As part of EPA’s National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit program, which is now required for any project that disturbs an area of one (1) acre or more,
the New Hampshire Division of Historical Resources must be contacted. If the site is noted as potentially
historically significant based on their data sources, NHDHR will determine if additional on-site studies are
necessary. If, based upon local knowledge, a project is proposed in an area of known historical resource, the
Planning Board may require an applicant to undertake an archeological study to determine the extent of the
resource and what impact could occur from the proposed development. The exact scope of the study shall be
determined through discussions with the applicant and the historical consultant. The Planning Board may also
request the assistance from the Hollis Heritage Commission to obtain input and advice.
After determining which studies may be necessary for application acceptance, the Planning Board reserves the right
to amend or reverse such decision and require additional studies when, in the course of the review process, the
Planning Board deems it necessary to require the same in order to properly evaluate the development proposal.
L. WAIVERS. Pursuant to RSA 674:44, III(e), waivers may be granted to any of the requirements of these Site
Plan Regulations, provided the Board finds, by majority vote, that:
8. Strict conformity would pose an unnecessary hardship to the applicant and waiver would not be contrary to the
spirit and intent of the regulations; or
9. Specific circumstances relative to the site plan, or conditions of land in such subdivision, indicate that the
waiver will properly carry out the spirit and intent of the regulations.
All requests for waiver(s) pursuant to this section shall be submitted in writing, and shall be included in the package of
materials submitted by the applicant with their request for application acceptance. Such waiver request(s) shall be
supported by sufficient grounds, supporting one of the two noted criteria outlined above, to demonstrate to the
Planning Board why the required studies are unnecessary for the Board’s consideration of their plan.

CURRENT USE QUALIFICATIONS
Any parcel that meets one or more of the
following can potentially qualify for Current Use:
1.) At least 10 acres of undeveloped, contiguous
farm, forest and/or unproductive land;
2.) Wetlands of any size, which meets the
wetlands definition as established by the
Current Use Board.;
3.) A Certified Tree Farm;
4.) Agricultural land of any size that produces
$2500, or more, gross product annually. A
yearly accounting of product is required.
APPLYING FOR CURRENT USE
Applications must be submitted by April 15th for
the year which you are applying. The following
items must be submitted with your original
application:
1.) Completed Form A10,
“Application for
Current Use” (Available online or in the
Assessing Office);
2.) Recording fee, in accordance with CUSE
302.02. This fee will be refunded if the
application is withdrawn or denied;
3.) A map/plan of the property, showing the
areas being enrolled in the Current Use
program;
4.) The Soil Potential Index (SPI) letter or
Forested Stewardship documents, if
applicable.
5.) If more than one parcel/lot is being used to
meet the 10acre
requirement, ownership of
all parcels must be identical.
An applicant may withdraw the application in the
same year it was submitted, provided that the
application has not yet recorded with the County
Registry of Deeds.
The Town must notify you by July 1st as to
whether your application was approved or denied.
20% RECREATIONAL ADJUSTMENT
Enrolling your land in the Current Use program
does not require that it be open for Public Use.
However, an additional 20% reduction in
assessment is available when allowing public use
of your property for the following activities,
unless detrimental to agricultural activities/crops:
Hunting Fishing
Hiking Skiing
Snowshoeing Nature Observation
Your property can be posted against mechanized
and off highway vehicles, camping, etc, and still
qualify for the recreational adjustment.
If you have been receiving recreational
adjustment, and you wish to remove it, the
Assessing Office must be notified, in writing, by
April 1st for the upcoming tax year. Once the
recreational adjustment has been removed, it may
not be reinstated for 3 years, including the year of
disallowance.
CHANGING CATERGORIES
You may change the Current Use category
annually. The Assessing Office must be notified, in
writing, of the category change no later than April
1st for the upcoming tax year. An updated Current
Use Map/Plan is required.
REMOVING LAND FROM CURRENT USE
Once land has been approved and the application
recorded, the property cannot be removed from
Current Use until a disqualifying event occurs.
Common reasons why a property may disqualify
for the Current Use program include, but are not
limited to:
1.) Construction of any structure on Current Use
land;
2.) No longer meeting the 10+ acres under
identical ownership;
3.) Not meeting the $2500 gross income for
agricultural products for 2 years in a 5 year
period;
4.) Other factors not listed here.
If a parcel of land no longer qualifies for Current
Use, the Land Use Change Tax (LUCT) is
determined by the Assessor. In accordance with
RSA 79A,
the LUCT is assessed at 10% of the Fair
Market Value of the land at its highest and best
use, and is issued within 18 months of the
discovery by Town officials, with certain
exceptions per CUB 307. The LUCT is a tax based
on the change of use of the land, and is not a tax on
the land itself, per RSA 79A:
7,I.
FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
Q: I’d like to construct a house/barn/shed on my
Current Use land. How does that affect Current Use?
Can the land remain in Current Use?
A: Structures of any kind are not allowed on
Current Use land. The land on which the structure
is to be sited will be removed from Current Use
and the LUCT assessed accordingly. If the
remainder of the land still meets Current Use
requirements, the land will stay in Current Use.
Q: I raise horses/alpacas/cows/other farm
animals, and I have more than 10 acres. It’s an
agricultural use, so why don’t I qualify?
A: CUB 304.02 (a) defines agricultural use as
“…undeveloped land, devoted to, or capable of, the
production of agricultural or horticultural crops…”
Any land used for grooming, turnouts,
pens, etc. is
considered ineligible for Current Use, as animal
husbandry is not a qualifying use under present
laws. However, pasturage land may qualify.
Q: I want to subdivide my property for future use,
but I don’t plan on selling any lots now. Does this
make it ineligible for Current Use?
A: Subdivision of a property does not disqualify a
parcel, as long as the property still meets Current
Use requirements. Current Use land may be made
up of multiple, contiguous parcels; as long as the
properties meet the requirements, the property
will still qualify.
Q: If I have land in Current Use, do I have to allow
public use?
A: Unless you are receiving the 20% Recreational
Adjustment, as outlined previously, you do not
have to allow public use or access.
Q: I just bought property that has been in the
Current Use program. What do I have to do to keep
it in Current Use?
A: As long as the property continues to meet the
Current Use requirements, you do not need to do
anything. Current Use stays with the land, not the
owner.
CURRENT USE – RSA 79A
RSA 79A
was enacted by the NH State Legislation
on July 1, 1973. The purpose of this law was to
implement a tax strategy to enable landowners to
keep their open space lands undeveloped. Under
Current Use, the land is assessed at its present use
rather than at its highest potential use. In addition,
the Current Use Board (CUB) Administrative Rules
define the law under RSA 79A.

Introduction
This handbook contains Guidelines and Regulations for all renovation
or new construction work in the Hollis Historic District. It represents a
significant amount of research, discussion, writing and review by a seven
member sub-committee of the Hollis Historic District Commission (HOC).
The members of this committee are all residents of Hollis and have
professional or avocational backgrounds in the fields of building design,
construction, real estate, historic preservation, writing, landscape design
and history. In addition to studying the specific architecture and history of
Hollis, the committee studied the guidelines and regulations of nine other
towns in New Hampshire and Massachusetts in developing these guidelines
and regulations for Hollis.
In 1971 the citizens of Hollis voted to create the Historic District to
safeguard our town's heritage. These Regulations are intended to help the
residents of the District and the members of the HOC preserve the visual
qualities of the District in a fair and consistent manner. We have included
background information on the history of Hollis as well as descriptive
details illustrating the various architectural styles evident in the District.
It is our belief that with a greater understanding of the principles of design
incorporated in the better preserved buildings in the District, more informed
design decisions will be made as the buildings of the District are repaired,
modified or new buildings erected.
While these Design Guidelines and Regulations are to be fairly applied,
there is sufficient latitude given in the section on Enforcement and waivers
to allow the members of the HDC discretion when conditions warrant.
The past two and a half centuries have sewn Hollis together as a
comfortable quilt made up of our individual patches of property. With
good guidelines, reasonable regulations and rational discussion, we are
confident this quilt will provide satisfaction to the owners of those
distinctive patches and the community as a whole.
The members of the Sub Committee have enjoyed this opportunity to
serve the town and look forward to enjoying the very tangible benefits of
this document.

History of Hollis
In January of 1731, Capt. Peter Powers of Dunstable, Massachusetts crossed
the Nashaway River with his young wife and two small children and
traveled ten miles into the wilderness to a small cabin that he had built on
land deeded to him by the proprietors of Old Dunstable, in the Province of
Massachusetts. Peter and his family thus became the first settlers of the
town we now know as Hollis. Peter Powers' little cabin was located just
northwest of the present day Four Comers, behind the house that stands at
8 Silver Lake Road .
Over the next ten years a number of settlers came to this area to establish
homesteads and raise families. In 1740 Abraham Taylor gave a portion of
the land from his grant to the town on which to establish the first meeting
house and provide for the burial ground and the training field. Before the
first meetinghouse was built, the placement of the boundary line between
the Provinces of New Hampshire and Massachusetts which "had been the
subject of protracted and acrimonious controversy" was finally established
and the people living north of our current state border found themselves
in New Hampshire not Massachusetts. Although this was a difficult
circumstance for many, they persisted in their efforts to settle the town and
comply with the laws in respect to the support of the ministry and the
erection of a church. Finally, the first meetinghouse was built in 1743 on
land where the present church now stands and the location of Holles Centre
was established.
On April 3, 1746 the town charter was signed by Governor Benning
Wentworth of New Hampshire and the land which was called Nissitisset
by Native Americans, and Old Dunstable and the Parish of West Dunstable
by the early settlers, was for a time known as Holles, named after Thomas
Pelham Holles, the Duke of Newcastle, to whom the Governor owed his
position. The first Town election was held April 28, 1746 and the number
of names on the first tax list for that year was fifty-three.
Over the next several decades the town grew rapidly. The natural resources
of Hollis made it favorable for farming with rich soils in the center of town
and many ponds and streams to provide water. For the first 200 years,
most of the householders of the town were farmers, with numbers of traders,
inn-keepers, blacksmiths, carpenters, shoemakers and other mechanics to
serve their needs. The abundance of forests also provided material for the
coopering trade which was carried on by farmers during the winter months.
The stands of timber along with the rivers and streams furnished suitable
mill sites, and saw mills also became a significant local industry.
7
As the 18th Century progressed the tiny log houses of the first settlers were
replaced by larger and more substantial buildings using lumber from the
nearby mills. In the census taken in 1783, there were listed 1,392 inhabitants,
174 dwelling-houses and 144 barns. By 1800 the population reached its
pre-twentieth century peak of 1,557 inhabitants. In 1820 there were five
grain mills, six saw mills, one clothing mill, one carding machine, one
tannery, two taverns and four stores. During the nineteenth century the
tide turned,.with the population gradually decreasing. Many of Hollis'
young folks chose to relocate either to the cities or the lands to the west
which were being opened up to new settlement. However, the Town Center
remained a strong focus of community life. The Always Ready Engine
House was built in 1859, the High School in 1877, the Town Hall in 1886
and many of the houses in the center of town were refurbished or rebuilt in
the modern styles of the day. The fact that the railroad never came into
town helped Hollis retain its rural character, in that industry which might
have flourished here never developed because of the difficulties of
transportation. By 1902 the population had dropped to 910 inhabitants.
For the first half of this century although the population again began to
increase, Hollis continued to be a quiet farming community. Automobiles
made transportation easier for those who had jobs or markets in nearby
towns or cities. During the summer months, tourists and guests desirous
of spending pleasant days in the country were welcomed at a number of
homes throughout the town. This idyllic period was not to last. The past
30 years have seen a dramatic increase in residential development. Farms
are disappearing and the face of the landscape is rapidly changing. What
can we do to preserve the quiet country charm and rural atmosphere that
many of us remember and most of us desire? The first step was made in
1971 when the Town approved an Ordinance establishing an Historic
District in the town center and appointing members to an Historic District
Commission.

What Is An Historic District
An Historic District is an area in a community which townspeople have
voted to designate as special because of its significance and place in
American history. By doing so, cities and towns create a comprehensive
mechanism for protecting historic structures and areas.
The goal of the Commission is to preserve the structures and places of
historic and architectural value in the Historic District so as to safeguard
the heritage of the town; and to set up clear and objective rules so that
decisions and permits are not based on the personal tastes and preferences
of the Commission members reviewing proposals for change.
In New Hampshire, the establishment of Historic Districts is authorized
by state legislation, RSA 673:1, 674:45. The purpose of this legislation is to
preserve and safeguard aesthetic, cultural, and historical features of the
District which may be threatened with extinction. Like zoning, an Historic
District overlay zone is a legal entity that helps preserve and protect
property values and the character of a neighborhood.
"The District's purpose is to safeguard the heritage of [the center of
Hollis] by (a) preserving a District which reflects elements of its cultural,
social, economic, political and architectural history; (b) conserving property
values in such District; ( c) fostering civic beauty; ( d) strengthening the local
economy and ( e) promoting the use of an Historic District for the education,
pleasure and welfare of the citizens." RSA 674:45
Under the terms of the Ordinance, the Commission is authorized to
regulate the construction, alteration, painting, moving, demolition or use
of structures and places within the Historic District. It does this by requiring
property owners to apply for approval when they wish to make an exterior
change to existing buildings, iand and uses within the boundaries of the
District.
The intent of the Ordinance is not to freeze the Historic District into any
one period or to prevent future change. Much of its charm and character is
derived from its evolution over more than two centuries and what the
various buildings convey about changing life styles, owners and uses. Its
purpose is, however, to ensure that the changes that occur in the District
are compatible with the surrounding historic environment - the buildings,
sites, and overall setting.
Benefits of the Historic District include a public recognition of the
importance of Hollis heritage, one that is shared not just by those residing
within the District, but by the entire community; a stabilizing effect on
property values; and the economic benefits of drawing visitors to the area.
Therefore, the HDC will adhere to the goals and spirit of the Town's Master
Plan.

Architectural Styles
The architecture of Hollis represents almost all periods of our Town's
history. In order to appreciate our architectural history we need to
understand and recognize what we have.
The following three terms will help us identify what is involved when
we discuss our architectural heritage.
A. Building type, B. Architectural style, C. Period architecture.
A. The building "type", or form, refers to the shape and massing of a
particular structure (see drawings at end of booklet). For example:
1. The term "Hall and Parlor" house refers to a "type" of house that is
two rooms (units) wide, one room deep and one story high. This is a
linear shape or form.
2. The "I House" refers to a "type" that is two rooms wide, one room
deep and two stories high. This is also a linear form.
3. The "Cape Cod" house is two rooms wide, two rooms deep and one
story high. This is called a massed plan.
4. The "Salt Box" is one or two rooms deep, one or two rooms high in
front, with a sloping roof which covers a rear addition that is not as high
as the front.
5. The "box house" is a massed plan two or more rooms wide, two rooms
deep and two rooms high.
6. The "four square" is a massed plan two or more rooms wide, two
rooms deep and two rooms high with a pyramidal roof.
B. The "style" of a building consists of the way certain architectural details
and design characteristics are applied to a building "type." The style is
derived from the application of design concepts such as massing, scale,
proportion and symmetry. It also derives from the nature of the design
elements; the building materials, shapes, color, ornament-the architectural
details themselves. These architectural details could theoretically be applied
to any "type" of building. The style can be thought of as the clothing of the
building.
C. The "period" represents the "time frame" during which the building
was constructed. When you hear the words "period building" whether it
be Georgian, Federal or Greek Revival, it simply means that the building
would have been built during that particular period of time when the style
was first in vogue. For example, for a building to be of true Georgian period
and style, it would have to exhibit the particular design characteristics of
the Georgian style and also to have been built during the Georgian period;
that is, from about 1720 to 1780.
10
The Colonial Period: 1730 - 1780
The colonial period in Hollis covered the time from the first settlement in
1731 up through the time of the American Revolution. The Colonial "style"
if you can call it that, persisted well into the 1800's. Actually the term
"colonial style" reflects a building which is really lacking in style or fancy
ornamentation. These early buildings were out of necessity modest in scale
and elaboration and generally exhibited the following characteristics:
• one or two stories high, oriented toward the south, gable ends
• steeply pitched roof with large, centrally located chimney
• timber framed, covered in split shingles or clapboards
• exteriors unadorned
• eaves close to the windows
• windows: double hung with 9 or 12 small lights and wide muntin bars
• hand forged iron for hinges, handles and nails
• may show an incremental process of construction over an extended
period of time
• later 18th Century models may exhibit lower roof slope, regularly
placed and proportionately larger door and window openings, paneled
doors and shutters, transom light above the door and gabled dormer
windows, but still the absence of ornamentation was evident
• buildings would have been left unpainted to weather to a brown-gray
color rather than painted in colonial times. After paint was introduced
colors would have been limited to earth tones.
Examples of Colonial architecture in the Hollis Historic District include:
the first Parsonage, now called "The Meetinghouse" on the corner of
Cleasby Lane and Monument Square, "The Worcester House" on the corner
of Depot Road and Richardson Road, "The Emerson House" at 5 Broad
Street. Each of these buildings exhibits a very plain exterior. Even with
subsequent alterations and additions the original Colonial fabric of the
building is very much evident
The Emerson House
11
The Georgian Period: 1720 -1780
The Georgian Style as opposed to the Colonial is essentially a "high style"
tradition. American Georgian buildings were based on English precedents
that reflected formal designs adapted from the ancient classical orders of
the Romans. This building would typically exhibit:
• symmetrical facade, bays evenly spaced, 5 bays are typical
• box type building with a "blocky" solid appearance, square shape
• roofs, in Hollis, typically hipped or gambrel
• roof pitch slightly lower, may have a large central chimney or two
chimneys which have moved out toward the end walls
• eaves had classical cornices often with modillions
• clapboards were narrower than Colonial clapboards
• windows aligned, capped with classical crown moldings or cornices
• emphasis on the entrance, distinctive paneled front door, accentuated
by pilasters and capped by a pedimented entablature
• brass hardware became more common
• upper windows set just below the eaves, same size as lower windows
• 12 over 12 or 9 over 12 divided lights, small panes of glass with thick
mun tins
• neither louvered blinds nor shutters were evident until late in the 18th
century
•a transom light, either rectangular or half round, was common
• covered porches at the front door were not common
• buildings would have been left unpainted to weather to a brown-gray
color in this time period, paint colors could have been cheerful tones of
blue, green, salmon or yellow or darker Colonial colors.
Examples of Georgian Architecture in the Hollis Historic District include:
"The Poole House" at 19 Main Street, built in 1871, "The Samuel Cumings
House" at 27 Main Street, and "The Rev. Eli Smith House" on Monument
Square opposite the Church, built ca.1794-1800.

The Federal Period: 1780 - 1820
The Federal Style exhibits a continuing progression based on the earlier
Georgian style and marks the end of a long evolution in architectural
development. Federal houses exhibited a very rigid symmetry with strong
emphasis on the front entrance and windows evenly spaced across the front
facade. The Federal style appears lighter in its massing and more delicate
in its details, more refined and sophisticated. Features of this style include:
• gable or hip roofs common - with a lower pitch
• chimneys moved out toward the exterior end walls
• four chimneys may be evident
•cornice embellished by decorative moldings called dentils
• doorways were emphasized but exhibited less wood than Georgian,
columns and pilasters were slim and light
• door surrounds often had semicircular fanlights and sidelights and
transoms, but a distinctive feature was the elliptical fanlight with
delicate tracery in lead or wood
• hardware became more delicate of brass and iron
• six or eight panel doors looked flatter than the Georgian counterparts
• Palladian windows (three part with an arched center section) were
common
• windows: floor-length, double or triple-sash, larger panels of glass,
thinner muntins, six over six windows were common after 1800
• decorative motifs included swags, garlands, urns; even fence and rail
in wood and iron were used as decorative features
• buildings often included curving or multisided bays, elliptical rooms,
semicircular or octagonal bays or porticoes, domed and arched ceilings
• Federal buildings were often built of brick, if sheathed in clapboards,
they would be painted in white or pastel colors.
Examples of Federal architecture in the Hollis Historic District include:
"The Little Mansion" at 38 Main Street, built in 1806, "The Parsonage" at
33 Main Street, built in 1811 and "The Gatehouse" at 25 Broad Street that
has a fine example of an elliptical fanlight with sidelights and tracery at
the front door and was built in 1830.
The Little Mansion
13
The Greek Revival: 1825 - 1860
The Greek Revival Style also known as the "National"style was the first
national fad to sweep across the newly independent United States. It was
the dominant style for domestic architecture for the first half of the 19th
century and has never completely disappeared. It is based on the classical
models of Greek architecture which exhibited a series of columns supporting
a triangular pediment reminiscent of the Greek temple. The innovation of
this style was to tum the gable end of the building to face the street and
place the entrance off to one side. This was usually represented by a threebay
facade. Other features of the Greek Revival style include:
• gable roofs with a lower pitch, some roofs were almost flat
• small chimneys since heating was now done by stoves and furnaces
• pedimented gables, with heavy entablature including the cornice,
frieze and architrave were found on the roofs of buildings and porches;
these wide bands of trim were almost universal
•widened comer boards, or pilasters at the corners of the building
• one story high porch supported by columns; doors usually had four
panels and included rectangular transom lights and sidelights
• doors recessed a foot or two behind the front wall of the building
• windows, six over six and later two over two
• headcasings or pediments on windows often exhibited a low-pitched
triangular shape
• Greek Revival buildings were almost always painted white, a symbol of
purity, and shutters, when present, were painted dark green; this
combination became so popular, that even colonial buildings were painted
white; the roofs were typically standing seam metal which was painted
either red or green; other suitable colors for the body of the building would
include pale yellow, light gray or sandstone; trim colors include cool white,
dark green and sandstone; door colors are dark green, medium blue or
black
Examples of Greek Revival architecture in the Hollis Historic District
include: "The Always Ready Engine House" on Main Street, built in 1859,
the "Stickney House" at 4 Broad
Street, built about 1840, the
"Hardy House" - Brookdale
Farms, at 36 Broad Street, built in
1849, and "Buttonwood Farm" 43-
45 Main Street remodeled after
1849.
14
The Always Ready Engine House
Gothic Revival/Carpenter Gothic: 1840 -1880
The Gothic Revival Style was seen as a Christian style, it was felt that if
one lived in a Gothic, that is a Christian style building, it would be
conducive to leading a moral life. Characteristics which distinguish the
Gothic Revival style include:
• a :rertical axis, the tendency to direct the eye upward, although
typically American Gothic buildings were but one and a half or two
stories high
•roofs were steep with cross gables, and "gingerbread" or elaborately
shaped wooden decorative elements, sawn into the vergeboards (or
bargeboards) outline the V shape of the gable front
• wall surface material extended up into the gable without a break,
vertical siding
• single stm:y porches were common, supported by flattened Gothic
arches
• verandas and balconies were embellished with brackets and decorative
Gothic detailing
• the floor plan, was asymmetrical with an L-shaped plan
• windows were usually two over two but sometimes had diamond
shaped panes; bay windows were common; windows often extended
into gables and frequently had a window crown or drip-mold, either in a
square or Gothic arch shape extending partway down the sides of the
window frame; most buildings had at least one window with Gothic
detailing
• :'e~tical siding painted in earthy tones of brown, beige or even pink;
trrm m shades of brown and doors in dark red, brown or green.
I
Examples of Gothic Revival architecture in the Hollis Historic District
include: 4 Silver Lake Road, built in 1860, once known as the
"Gingerbread House." All traces of the Carpenter Gothic ornament have
been removed. However, the steeply pitched cross gables, widely
overhanging eaves which could support bargeboards, the flattened
arches connecting the porch supports and the placement of the front
door tucked right against the comer of the intersecting ell wall are
typical of a Gothic cottage. There are traces of Gothic elements in a
number of other buildings in town.

Italianate: 1840 - 1885
The Italianate Style was very popular during the 1850's and the 1860's.
The decorative brackets that adorn the eaves of the Italianate building
immediately identify the style, thus the name "American Bracket" style.
In fact, brackets and verandas were often added to older farmhouses to
give them a stylish uplift. Identifying features include:
• houses of wood, two or three stories high, most with a symmetrical
facade but others had asymmetrical features with towers, ells, bay
windows, balustraded balconies and verandas; almost all had porches,
often with square porch supports with beveled corners
• low-pitched roof with a broad overhang, supported by brackets
mounted either singly or in pairs
• many had square towers or cupolas
• windows were tall and narrow, often with arched or curved tops and
carved or molded window crowns; the sashes were usually two over
two; bay windows common, as were adjacent pairs of rectangular or
round-headed windows
• double entrance doors common and for the first time, glass was
incorporated into the door itself rather than in a transom or side lights
• exteriors were painted warm, light colors of brown, gray or green with
contrasting trim and dark doors.
Local examples include: the "Victorian" building at 35 Main Street which
was built about 1878/79. Other buildings in town that exhibit details of
the "Bracket Style" include "Buttonwood Farm" 43-45 Main Street, 71
Dep;:it Road (corner of Merrill Lane) and 4 Lund Lane (Lund and Silver
Lake Road) - the SAU building.
35Main
Queen Anne: 1880 - 1910
The Queen Anne Style was exuberant, characterized by a variety of shapes
and textures and asymmetrical massing. Wall surfaces were used as primary
decorative elements; plain flat walls were avoided, and combinations of
different textured wall materials were used, shingle above clapboard or
above brick. Towers were often placed at a front facade corner. Buildings
were polychrome, painted with numerous combinations of bold colors.
Identifying features of the Queen Anne style include:
• steeply pitched roofs, highly irregular, with a complex blend of roof
lines, dormers, gables, turrets, and tall, multiple chimney with panels;
large central hipped roof with a dominant front-facing gable
• each side of the building will present a different combination of
features. Many devices were used to avoid a smooth-walled appearance,
e.g., cut-away bays, balconies, verandas, and towers; the vertical wall
surfaces were divided into horizontal bands by using various siding
materials - stone, brick, clapboards and patterned shingles in various
combinations; walls were painted with bold colors to emphasize the
patterns
• windows varied greatly: Palladian, double-hung, round or round
headed, some with one large pane of glass w1der, or surrounded by,
smaller colored panes; doors were generally single, often with stained
glass set into them
• decorative detailing called spindlework or gingerbread was freely
applied, including turned porch supports and porch balustrades, frieze
bands at the porch roof, spandrels and knob-like beads; building
components which were used on Queen Anne buildings such as knee
braces, brackets and spindle~ were sold by mail-order companies and
were shipped across the country to embellish older vernacular buildings.
Examples of the Queen Anne Style include elements of the Town Hall
and 1 Depot Road.
The Town Hall

Shingle Style: 1880 - 1900
The Shingle Style does not emphasize decorative detailing, instead it
displays a complex roof shape within a smooth wall surface which
unifies the irregular outline of the building.
Identifying features include:
• wall cladding and roofing of continuous wood shingles although the
shingles may occur on the second story only
• shingles continue around the walls without interruption, no corner
boards
• asymmetrical facade with irregular, steeply pitched roof line, roofs
usually have intersecting cross-gables and multi-level eaves
• extensive porches were common
• towers appear as partial bulges or half towers
• porch supports are either slender, unadorned wooden posts or massive
piers of stone or shingle cladding; generally porches were located under
the main roof line; Romanesque arches may be used on porches or
windows
• eyebrow windows and wavy wall surfaces were also used.
Examples of the Shingle Style in Hollis are 1 Depot Road (Seep. 18; this
building originally showed strong characteristics of the Shingle Style
with some elements of the Queen Anne) and 91 Worcester Road. The
building at 77 Broad Street also had elements of the Shingle Style at the
turn of the century.
Folk Victorian: 1870 -1910
This style is characterized by an overall simplicity of form. Decorative
treatment is usually confined to porch trim in the form of turned spindles
and lace-like spandrels, or flat jig-saw cut trim, sometimes with gable trim
and brackets under the eaves. Window surrounds may have a simple
pediment above. . Door hoods and brackets were common. These
decorative details were less elaborate and extensive than on the styles they
were imitating and were applied to the common folk building forms existing
or being built at the time. The gable front and wing with a centered gable
in the wing is a common form in Hollis.
16 Broad Street

Examples of Folk Victorian style in the District include: 16 Broad Street,
30 Ash Street, 15 Main Street, 17 Main Street, 18 Main Street, 1 Broad
Street, and 39 Main Street.

Building Exterior
Hollis Historic District is comprised of buildings that span the time from
1744 to the present day. Each building is distinctly different and conveys
both its own history and a piece of the story of Hollis. Similarly, alterations
to a single building impact not only the architectural character of that
structure but the overall character and integrity of the entire District.
Walls and Trim
The buildings in the Hollis Historic District are defined in large part by
the prevalence of wood, used for clapboards, shingles, and trim. To retain
this character, it is critical that painted wooden clapboards which match
those existing in terms of exposed width, continue to be the material used
when replacing deteriorated clapboard siding. These details must be
consistent.
'"'
However, alternative siding such as vinyl may be considered (at the
Board's discretion) but in all cases extreme attention will be given to the
trim details around windows and doors and at the comers, facia and eaves.
These details must be consistent with the architectural style of the building.
Attention shall be paid on older buildings to possible serious moisture
problems in covering old clapboards with alternative siding. Wooden
shingles or clapboards, shiplap and board and batten are suitable exterior
coverings for outbuildings; in general, the existing material shall be matched
in kind.
Exterior trim, such as cornerboards, door and window casings, cornices,
and door and gable pediments play a critical role in the appearance and
proportions of a building. All trim that contributes to the historic character
of a building shall be retained and preserved.
When it is necessary to replace all or portions of such features, they
shall be replaced to match that which has been removed, in terms of
material, design and placement. As much of the original feature as possible
shall be repaired, rather than replaced. If using the same kind of material
is not technically feasible, a compatible material may be considered. It is
not appropriate to install trim that relates to an earlier period, or different
style than the building (See Architectural Style section).
Painting and Color
When planning a paint job, it is usually .r;iecessary to remove only the
damaged or deteriorated paint to the next layer. Handscraping or hand
sanding are the preferred methods to avoid damaging the woodwork.
Heatguns, hot-air guns, or chemical strippers can be used to remove paint
when entire layers are so deteriorated that total removal is necessary for
adhesion. Sandblasting, waterblasting or using torches is not
recommended, as they can cause irreversible damage. The colors shall be
appropriate for the building's style taking into account that the original
style may have been modified in the late nineteenth or early twentieth
century and that those alterations are an integral part of the building's
history.
A Color guide for historical buildings is available from the Commission.
Color is regulated by the HDC, and applicants are required to register
their color choices. The Commission asks that owners respect the various
color schemes used for buildings in the District and consult the painting
guidelines available at the HDC reference library. The Pratt and Lambert
"Color Guide for Historical Homes" (one of several commercial color guides
showing historical colors) and The Old House Journal Guide to Restoration
showing appropriate colors for given periods and styles (including stains
for Colonial) may be used in the Building Inspector's Office where they
are housed with the HDC Reference Library (See also comments on paint
color in Architectural Styles section).

Roofs
Roofs are an important design element of historic buildings. The shape
of an existing historic roof shall not be altered. The color, type and size of
any new roofing material needs to be approved by the Commission.
Wooden shingles are the most historically appropriate for rural eighteenth
and nineteenth century buildings and the texture, variegated color and
warmth afforded by wood has special appeal. If asphalt shingles are
selected, a dark color is preferable. Asphalt architectural shingles that
imitate wooden shingles and slate are available from most roofing
companies. Repairs to existing slate roofs shall be made prior to replacing
the entire roof; frequently the problems on such roofs lie in flashing, or
substrates, rather than the slates themselves. Snow belts are allowable, but
shall be copper (preferable) or a dark, anodized aluminum for minimal
impact.
Skylights that are visible from the public way are not desireable. Low
profile skylights may be approved if they do not interrupt a significant
roofline. In lieu of skylights, small gabled or shed-red dormers might be
more appropriate.
Chimneys are also an important feature of historic buildings and shall
be retained. Chimneys in poor condition shall be rebuilt, rather than
removed. If a missing chimney is to be rebuilt, the reconstructed feature
shall be appropriately sized, positioned and constructed to appear
historically functional. Historic photographs might assist in the design. If
a new chimney is to be built, it shall be masonry and situated in a location
appropriate to the historic design and function of the building.
Television antennae, satellite dishes, solar collectors and other objects
affixed to the roof shall be installed on the rear, or a minimally visible slope
of a roof and be of the smallest size practical. The visual impact of electrical
wires and meters shall be minimized: where possible, wires shall be buried
for weather as well as aesthetics. Meters shall not be placed on the primary
fai;ade of a building but shall be located so as not to limit access by public
service personnel.

Windows and Blinds
The replacement windows on the first floor of
this building, with their strong horizontal lines,
are at odds with the historic vertical proportions
established by the original window openings
above. (Photo Jaffrey)
Windows, like trim details, are an essential part of the design of any
building. Most of the windows in the Historic District buildings are
regularly spaced and of similar size. The sash is nearly universally double
hung, with a wide range of lights, depending on the style and period.
Replacement windows shall follow the building's historic fenestration
pattern, including opening, size, placement, type of sash and generous
muntin profile. Replacement lights shall not be smaller, or of an earlier
period, than is appropriate for the building. It should be noted that small
paned windows were often replaced in the late nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries with 2 over 2 or 2 over 1 sash. In such cases, reverting
to smaller paned sash is neither necessary, nor always recommended, in
the course of restoring a building. (Historic photographs available at the
Historical Society and SociaLLibrary are helpful in determining the
appearance of historic sash and at what date replacement sash was
installed.) Snap-in interior muntins are not recommended unless paired
with exterior mun tins when remodeling an historically significant building.
Exterior storm windows are appropriate for historic buildings, but their
meeting rails shall line up with the primary sash, and the tops match the
shape of the primary sash. Storms shall be painted the color of the primary
sash; if a factory finish is used, its color shall approximate the color of the
primary sash.
Window air conditioners are allowed, preferably in an inconspicuous
location and preferably removed on a seasonal basis.
If authentic exterior wood blinds (shutters) have remained with the
building, they shall be maintained and used. Exterior blinds of metal or
synthetic materials are not recommended as substitutes, since they are often
not sized properly and their appearance is not authentic.

This addition would have been more successful if it had been slightly
set back from the original building and if the roofpitch and window
proportions matched those of the original building. (Photo from

Entrances and Porches
Entrances are usually the focal point of the buildings in the Historic
District and an integral component of design. Features such as fanlights,
sidelights, pilasters, entablatures and granite steps shall be retained at all
costs. If replacement due to deterioration is necessary, the features shall be
faithfully replicated. If the entrance to a barn is modified, the size and
location of the historic opening shall remain clearly apparent. Storms and
screens shall be painted to match doors and compliment the primary door
in design.
Most of the porches in the District are on secondary elevations and many
were added after the building was constructed. However, they have since
become an integral part of the building's history and shall be maintained
and preserved. Missing features, such as balusters, posts or balustrades,
shall be carefully replicated when replacement is necessary.
When an open porch is to be screened, the screens and frames shall be
installed behind the posts and railing, so that the historic details remain
fully visible to the public view.
New Additions to Existing Buildings
In the design of an addition to an historic building, the scale, size and
materials of the addition shall neither overwhelm the historic building nor
obscure its significant historic materials and features. Additions shall be
placed onto secondary elevations; the preferred choice is usually on the
rear or an inconspicuous side. If the buildings consist of a main house, an
ell and an attached barn, the proportional relationship shall not be lost in
the course of building an addition. Generally, the addition should not try
to mimic the historic building, but should reflect it in terms of scale, massing
and overall proportions. A traditional design and traditional materials will
usually be most suitable within the Hollis Historic District. Roof shapes,
height, materials, fenestration and doors are key design issues. They shall
24
be compatible with the historic building and any previous addition.
Moldings and other details might be simplified in the addition, both to
make clear a distinction between the old and new, and to keep the addition
secondary to the historic building. (A major addition will probably require
professional design services.)
Major new additions can be designed to enhance Screen panels on this porch have been
the original form of the building. Though windows installed on the inside allowing the

and they are grouped in a way that evokes historic visible. (Photo from Jaffrey)
sheds and barns (Photo from Jaffrey).
New Porches and Decks
Designs for new porches shall either follow an historic porch that has
since been removed or be a new design that is compatible with the historic
character of the building. Bear in mind that porches were often appended
to earlier buildings in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Closely spaced
lattice is an appropriate screening method for the structure. Though
pressure-treated lumber is recommended, all exposed sections shall be
painted to match the trim or1 color of the building. New decks shall be
located off secondary elevations and painted to match porch decks and
building trim.
Ramps
Modifications to historic buildings for barrier-free access shall
accommodate both the needs of disabled people and the historic
characteristics of the building. Ramps shall be located so as not to obscure
or_ ~ause the removal of historic features. Simple wooden or iron pipe
railmgs are usually appropriate; exposed wooden elements shall be
considered trim and painted to match the trim color of the building.

New Construction in the Historic District
As stated in other sections of these regulations the Hollis Historic District
is an area which the townspeople have voted to designate as being unique
because of its significance and place in American history.
Considerable detail has been provided to guide property owners with
the ongoing maintenance and upgrading of their houses and buildings in
a manner that will preserve and safeguard aesthetic, cultural and historic
features of the the District. New buildings in the District are to be held to
the standards of changes to existing buildings. New buildings face the
additional challenge of having to minimize the impact they will make by
reducing portions of open space which is a valued asset of any community.
It is expected that all new buildings in the Historic District will respect the
fact that Hollis is a rural community whose architecture consists primarily
of traditional shapes and that new structures will fit comfortably with these
existing structures. Stylistic elements on new construction which do not
relate to existing elements on historic buildings in the bistrict shall generally
be disallowed.
All new construction within the Historic District shall be designed with
the goal of enhancing the appearance of existing buildings by being
consistent with the those buildings in terms of rhythm, siting, scale,
architectural features and materials. The rich and varied styles and
configurations of the existing buildings in the Historic District give the
modern designer significant latitude to satisfy the requirements of both
the new owner and the Historic District.
Siting
New structures shall be located so as to be consistent with the set back
of the buildings nearest to them, thereby preserving the views up and down
the street with a consistent facade of building fronts. In order to accomplish
this, the HDC may .recommend that the ZBA allow variances to the town
regulated front setback requirements.
Scale
New structures shall be in harmony with the mass, scale and proportion
of adjacent buildings.
Architectural Features
New structures shall not introduce architectural features that are
inconsistent with other buildings in the area. The shape of the building,
pitch of the roof, size of dormers, presentation of gables to or away from
the street must be appropriate to the architectural styles nearby.
?R
Windows and Doors
The size, shape and frequency of these openings shall be consistent with
other buildings in the area. The predominant window in the District is a
double hung window with true divided lights. These windows are available
from many manufacturers with the most modern energy specifications.
Roof windows (skylights) or casement windows are not usually appropriate
for the Historic District (see Exteriors).
Siding and Trim
The predominant siding in the District is wood, mostly clapboard with
some shingles used. Sidings such as vinyl may be considered (at the Board's
discretion) but in all cases extreme attention will be given to the trim details
around windows and doors and at the corners, fascia and eaves. These
details must be consistent with other buildings in the District (see Exteriors).
Color
Color is regulated by the HDC, and applicants are required to register
their color choices. The Commission asks that owners respect the various
color schemes used for buildings in the District and consult the painting
guidelines available at the HDC reference library.
Landscaping
Landscaping requirements for new structures that are multi family, or a
residential subdivision shall comply with landscaping requirements for
non-residential uses.
Impact
The impact that the applicant's proposal will have on the District and
the extent to which it will preserve and enhance the historical, architectural
and cultural qualities of the District and the community shall be considered
a vital part of the application (see District Setting).
Business District
The Business District, located within the Historic District, is subject to the
same conditions and regulations as the rest of the Historic District, as well
as the commercial zoning regulations set forth by the Town of Hollis.
Signage
All new signs and all changes in the appearance of existing signs require
a permit from the HDC. The Commission will follow the guidelines of the
Hollis Sign Ordinance, found in the zoning regulations, regarding location,
size, materials used and illumination of signs. Color and aesthetics of the
sign are important and must be in character with the structure and be
harmonious with the rest of the Historic District.
27
Streetscape
Off street parking shall be placed
to the rear of the building with
appropriate plantings and screening
(see District Setting and Landscape).
New Construction

Demolition
(See Demolition Section)
Change to Existing Structures
Changes to existing structures shall be made in such a manner as to
preserve the Historic District's distinctive character. The Commission,
aware that business timelines may differ from residential timelines, will
give expeditious treatment to business applications.
Town Owned, School and Church Properties
All property located within the Historic District, is subject to the same
conditions and regulations as the rest of the Historic District.
District Setting
Hollis's identity as an historic, rural village center depends, in large part,
upon its roadside trees, stone walls, open space, vistas, road width, low
lighting and the relationships of buildings to adjacent landscapes.
Preserving these features is critical to maintaining the District's distinctive
character. It is expected that each property owner will preserve and improve
the aesthetic qualities of his /her property whether undeveloped, business
or residential. This District setting section deals with existing, renovated
and new construction, and covers Town, commercial and residential sites.
All are within the District and coexist with each other contributing to the
feel of a rural village (See Landscape Section).
Stone Walls and Boundaries
Historical and traditional markings for property boundaries and grounds
such as walls, fences and tree borders shall be preserved. Stone walls shall
be retained in place and maintained. They may not be moved or removed.
Replications or extensions may be made if deemed appropriate (See
Landscape).
28
Open Space and Vistas
Hollis is fortunate to have a number of open areas, all of which add greatly
to t11e character of the District. Fields and scenic vistas or even glimpses
from one road to another in the District remind us of our agricultural
heritage. These spaces should be maintained as is, whenever possible, with
grass, scattered deciduous trees,
shrubs or agricultural fields
(Examples are Town owned
property on Depot Road and the
front of the new High School to
the swale). Any area noted in the
Master Plans as scenic should be
maintained as is. The
Commission asks that property
owners consider siting a new
building or additions so that
existing vistas are maintained
when possible.
View Richardson and Depot Road to
Monument Square
Screening of parking along Ash, Broad, Proctor Hill, Main and Silver
Lake Roads is to be encouraged as it retains the rural look which is so
characteristic of Hollis.
Monument Square Area
Because it represents the oldest center
of town currently preserved, changes to
buildings on Monument Square and
structures that can be seen from the
Square, shall be minimizd. Those
buildings shall be true to their period to
maintain the integrity of this area and are
subject to HDC guidelines and
regulations.
Streetscape
View of Monument Square
The flow and balance ofbuildings and open spaces which enhance them
is seen as one rides or walks from the High School to Monument Square or
beyond, or from Monument Square to Ash Street. Buildings have similar
setbacks from the street; there is a rhythm of fences and lawns. The massing
of the buildings is similar one to another even though the styles and dates
of construction are different. There are glimpses through yards to fields
and other town streets. This is the streetscape rhythm and flow which is to
be retained in a rural village. This rhythm, flow and balance of mass with
29
open space is to be preserved and not interrupted with unusual amounts
of blacktop, gaps of deep setbacks without a flow of fencing, shrubs or
trees to carry the eye to the next building, or interrupted or blocked by
disproportionately large or tall objects or structures
A typical village streetscape
Interruption of the Tree Line
It is criti~al to preserve the rural character of the landscape, open vistas,
views and skyline. Any structure in the Town which will have a visual,
auditory, or olfactory impact on these elements in the Historic District shall
be subject to review by the HDC. The review of any such exceptional
structure which has atypical protuberances or height must include
drawings, photos and a simple model with the application. In the case of
high structures, this must show grades and impact on view from cardinal
points throughout a distance of a 3 mile radius.
The Planning Board shall be aware that this might mean that building
of some structure outside the Historic District would have an impact on
the view, noise or odor within it and the representative from the Planning
Board on the HDC is asked to be a liaison for this.
Structures included in this category but not necessarily limited to the
following are: solar collectors, towers, satellite dishes, wind activated power
generating equipment, restaurants and animal facilities. All the above will
be reviewed for possible impact.
Interruption to the Streetscape by Man-made Objects -Siting and Screening
lri the Historic District it is particularly important that large items such
as above ground swimming pools, tennis courts, tracks, riding rings,
antennae, satellite dishes and trash receptacles be sited. to minimize their
visual impact and be screened or conce~ed from view as much as possible.
Any of the following objects, but not limited to them, which are publicly
visible may be required to be sited elsewhere, minimized or concealed where
not in character with the Historic District: man-made decorative objects,
modern appurtenances, large or obtrusive personal property, equipment
and. machinery, e.g. recreational camping vehicles, boats, snowmobiles,
storage sheds, landscaping features such as waterfalls, pools and berms.
Parking of vehicles on lawns is discouraged.
All refuse storage areas, commercial/industrial by-products, material
storage areas, and stockpiles shall be located so as to be out of view in all
seasons from any abutting property and/ or public ways. As a minimum,
\
I
all such areas within view of adjoining properties shall be contained within
a stockade fence or similar enclosure which is at least as tall as the object(s)
to be screened and shall be softened by plantings. Seasonal displays are
permitted.
It is recommended that mailboxes be properly mounted on simple wood,
granite or black metal posts. Newspaper holder/ containers for a given
property shall all be on one erect sturdy post; if the property has a rural
mailbox, its post shall be used for all containers, mail and newspapers.
Sidewalks and Roads
Road changes proposed within the Historic District should be reviewed
by the HDC. They shall encourage safe pedestrian traffic which promotes
a village flavor. The impact of large areas of asphalt or cement is not in
keeping with Hollis' s rural character; where asphalt is necessary, softening
the effect is recommended by the use of stone dust~ Portland dust or chip
seal. The use of cobbles, brick or grass strips to define areas and break up
large expanses of paving is to be encouraged. .
The existing sidewalks shall be retained as paved walkways with
concrete. Additional sidewalks are recommended as a promotion of
pedestrian traffic which is in keeping with a rural village (See Street Tree
Area below).
Even though the main routes through Hollis are state highways, they
shall not exceed their current width. No road widths shall be increased I
beyond existing, and intersections shall not be widened. Road shoulders
shall not be paved, but left as grass or, if absolutely necessary, gravel.
Unpaved roads such as Richardson in the Historic District are designated
scenic and come under those1criteria. Should new roads be created, they
shall be visually softened as above. Parking on the streets in the District
shall not be increased beyond the existing.
Off-Street Parking
All non-residential off-street parking, if paved, shall be paved with
visually softened paving and large areas broken aesthetically by grass, brick
or cobble areas. The display of automobiles or other objects which may be
for sale and the storage of raw or processed materials shall not be permitted
within any required off-street parking spaces, drives or aisles. Adequate
space within, or immediately adjacent to, off-street parking lots shall be
provided for the storage of winter snow. A minimum of ten percent of the
internal space of a parking lot greater than twelve spaces shall be set aside
for green area.
Street Tree Area
All new and renovated sites shall include a Street Tree area to promote
the aesthetic quality of "tree lined streets". (See Landscape)
31
Roadside Trees and Shrubs
Roadside trees shall be maintained, protected and replaced in kind when
necessary. Mature trees, identified as significant trees per landscape
standards, may not be removed within the Historic District except in cases
where a tree is dead, decayed, diseased or a safety hazard to the public;
where such removal will improve other tree growth; or where approved
for new construction or site work.
When it is necessary to remove a tree for the above reasons, the tree
stump shall be removed to at least six inches below ground level. At least
one replacement tree shall be planted when a tree identified as a significant
tree is removed along road or front lot boundaries. The replacement tree
must conform to minimum landscape standards.
Excessive pruning is not encouraged. Not only do trees offer shade, but
they define the area as a residential village. A few low growing trees or
shrubs which do not block signage may well take the place of a fence in the
Business District and provide a more rural and inviting look. Care should
be taken not to impair visibility of vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Intrusive
shrubs and plantings shall be removed or kept in check through periodic
trimming.
Commercial and Civic Buildings
Consideration of, and provision for, pedestrians continue to be priorities
in a rural community and are conducive to commerce. Several advantages
result from locating buildings close to the road with sidewalks beside the
road and with parking placed at the side or rear of the building. Businesses
have the opportunity to display goods and place signs both facing the road
and the parking area. The community visual character is enhanced by
attractive facades along the corridors, access from one business to another
by foot promotes a village feel, neighborliness, and good exercise, and
parking lots are more easily screened.
Traditional canv.as coverings which may provide protection from sun
and rain are appropriate for commercial use. Ribbed awning will not be
approved. Colors and materials shall follow traditional example and be in
keeping with the color of the facade and trim. Clear plastic drop curtains
are generally inappropriate, walkway· canopies are inappropriate as they
distract from the architectural feature of historic structures. Tents are
approved for special events only and are time limited (See Temporary
Structures). Mechanical systems, e.g. heating and ventilation, will be
reviewed for noise and visual clutter. Dispensing and vending machines
must be out of view of the streets or abutting residences (See Siting and
Screening, p. 30).

Four Corners Street Lamp
Road Signs
~·········~·
~·,, r
Road signs can distinguish the District area from other areas in town. If
changed, they shall be black on white with a black rim, all use identical
fonts reminiscent of signboards used in the early days of the Town (See
Always Ready Engine House Marker) with the possible addition of a logo
such as the plow from the Town seal.
Lighting
All fixtures shall be positioned and/ or installed to prevent unwanted
incidental illumination of abutting properties, streets, and night time sky.
Glare, direction, and light level shall be considered. Replacement street
lights shall be compatible with the scale, low illumination and rural village
historic character of the District. Traffic signal poles and mounts shall be
as unobtrusive as possible. Unfinished aluminum poles and mounts shall
not be permitted. Where possible renovated, replacement or new electrical
lines shall be buried rather than overhead for weather as well as aesthetics.
Mercury vapor (blue tones) or Halide are required. Building lampposts
and fixtures shall be in scale and style with the building and shall contribute
to the property and not detract from it or its neighbors.
Archeology
Abandoned ruins, vestiges of public ways and potentially significant
archeological sites shall not be disturbed before an assessment of historical
value is made by the HDC.
33
Landscaping
To preserve and enhance the aesthetic qualities of the Hollis Historic District
by establishing landscape design guidelines and options which work in
relationship to the intensity of the proposed land use. It is hoped that
through the implementation of these Regulations the following objectives
can be accomplished: • Diminish potentially adverse impacts of structures,
lighting glare, noise, wind, and odors which could result from permitting
widely varying land uses on adjacent properties. • Insure that each tract
of land has benefit of an adequate buffer between neighboring parcels of
different land uses in order to protect property values. • Promote an
aesthetically pleasing relationship of scale between buildings and their
surroundings. • Reinforce the visual image of Hollis as a "tree-lined street"
community, through the planting of shade trees along roadways. The
planting of salt tolerant trees is recommmended. • Encourage a "pedestrianfriendly"
environment throt:.gh the inclusion of sidewalks, barrier free street
crossings and public benches.
General Landscape Provisions
All plantings required shall be installed according to accepted
horticultural standards and be regularly maintained. Required plantings
need to be replaced as necessary in order to maintain compliance.
Where existing plant material is to be utilized, the Commission shall
have the ability to verify the retained plantings at the completion of
construction and to require deficiencies to be corrected. In all cases where
the number of trees or shrubs per linear or square foot is specified, the
Commission wishes to make it clear that the placement or variety of plants
used is at the property owner's discretion. The Commission's concern is
that the intent of the regulation be satisfied. The Commission may waive
any landscape requirements when deemed to be necessary for reasons of
public safety.
Topography - All Buildings and Sites
The topography of a site shall not be changed significantly (permanently
raising or lowering or reconfiguring the existing height of the ground levels
or creating berms) without review and approval by the Commission. All
areas disturbed by construction shall be covered with a minimum thickness
of four inches of suitable topsoil and be subsequently planted with grass
seed, sod or other vegetative groundcover.
Landscaping Residential Buildings
The Commission recognizes that a home and/ or property, being
historically correct, may have limited or no landscaping. Residential
properties are encouraged to follow the guidelines for non-residential street
tree areas and front landscape areas.
34
Landscaping New Non-Residential Buildings,
Sub-divisions. and Multi-Unit Structures
Street Tree Area
All new and renovated sites shall install two street trees for every fifty
feet of right-of-way frontage. The Street Tree area shall be a fifteen foot
wide strip running parallel with the lot frontage along any public right of
way and shall be continuous along the entire length of the right of way
excepting areas reserved for curb cuts. The size of the trees to be planted
shall be a minimum of 1 %'' - 2" caliper at the time of planting. The lowest
branching height should be pruned to eight feet above grade so as not to
interfere with vehicular or pedestrian traffic. The Commission recommends
these trees be planted between ten and fifteen feet from the road edge as
they shall allow for sidewalk extension and future walkways as
recommended by Hollis Transportation Advisory Board (TAB).
Arrangement and variety are not controlled by the Commission, however
spacing between trees should be sufficient to provide room for healthy
growth. A list of possible salt tolerant trees has been provided (see appendix
B). Each healthy native tree with a caliper of three inches or greater, which
is preserved within the street tree area, may be substituted for required
new tree planting. (See also landscape charts in HDC library).
Typical Treescape
A Front Landscape Area is required and intended to promote a pleasing
relationship of scale between structures and related site improvements and
to integrate the design of the street tree area. This area shall be a strip of
variable width (minimum six feet wide) between the street tree area and
the closest point of a building. The front landscape area shall be planted
with a minimum of one deciduous or evergreen tree for every thirty feet of
building facing a right-of-way. Trees planted within this area shall have a
height equal to one-half of the maximum proposed building height (but
not less than twelve feet high or more than twenty feet high at time of
planting. The area shall be planted with at least one shrub for every five
feet of building facing a right-of-way. Shrubs must be a minimum of 2-1/
2 to 3 foot in height or width at time of planting. See starred(**) statement
at end of "Landscaping New Non-Residential Buildings" regarding
flexibility in placement and variety of plants.
35
I Street Side j Rear
Tree landscape landscape
~~~~-~Aare~ ~...:.::.;:A:re.a~ ~~;..._A~r~ea~ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
A Side and Rear Landscape Area are required along with the front landscape
area. These areas are intended to promote proper visual separation and
adequate buffering between adjoining properties. Parking, drives and
buildings shall not be located within any required side and rear landscape
areas. Side and rear landscape areas shall begin at the inner limits of the
front landscape area and run parallel to side and rear property lines. The
required minimum width of these landscape areas shall be no less than six
feet. Required side and rear landscape areas shall be constructed so as to
provide a dense visual four season screen.
**The Commission is concerned that the plants fulfill the intent
effectively. It recommends that plants be spaced for mature size and good
design principles but does not intend to determine placement nor variety
of plants used . A mixture of sixty percent evergreen and forty percent
deciduous shade trees and sixty percent evergreen and forty percent
deciduous shrubs is recommended to provide all season screening.
Examples of different acceptable screening options (appendix C) and a list
of historic plants (appendix A) has been provided and the use of such plants
is encouraged
Landscaping Off Street Parking
A landscape area for off street parking intended to create visual
screening of automobile parking areas, create summer shade along paved
surfaces and reduce wind velocity across open lot areas is required. This
will be achieved by a Pavement Area and, on large parking areas, an Interior
Island and Planting Strip.
The Pavement Landscape Area shall be a minimum of a 6 foot wide strip
running parallel to all parking and on-site driveway pavement edges. In
cases where this strip overlaps required front, side or rear landscape areas,
its required width may be reduced or eliminated. If the intent of this
regulation is satisfied without the use of this strip, the Commission may
waive this requirement. The minimum plant material needed for this
landscape area is calculated at one shrub per 15 feet of exterior pavement
edge and two trees per fifty feet of pavement edge.
36
An Interior Landscape Area shall be required for all parking lots with more
than twelve spaces. Its purpose shall be to break up large expanses of
pavement, provide summer shade on pavement areas and reduce wind
velocity. The interior landscape area shall be calculated as a minimum of
10% of the total area of paved drives, parking areas, etc. Island and planting
strips shall be planted with shade trees, evergreen shrubs, and deciduous
shrubs. The required number of shade trees shall be calculated as one
deciduous tree (minimum 11h.-inch caliper) per 400 sq.ft. of paved area.
The number of shrubs shall be equal to one shrub (minimum three foot
high) per one hundred thirty square feet of paved area.
**The Commission does not intend to determine placement nor variety
of plants used in off street parking landscaping but is concerned that the
plants fulfill the intent effectively. A mixture of sixty percent evergreen
and forty percent deciduous shade trees and sixty percent evergreen and
forty percent deciduous shrubs is recommended to provide all season
screening. A list of historic plants (appendix A) has been provided and
use of such plants is encouraged.
Renovating All Buildings
Any and all plant material damaged during renovations shall be repaired,
or replaced if necessary with a plant of similar variety and size if feasible.
Renovations to parking areas will be subject to the new off-street parking
landscape requirements. The Commission has the ability to reduce
minimum planting width as long as the proposed planting provides a dense
visual all-season screen.
Landscape Requirements for Signage
The required landscape area associated with any freestanding sign shall
be equal to at least twice the actual measured sign area and shall be located
immediately adjacent to the sign and/ or sign base. This landscape area
shall be planted with shrubs and/ or groundcover which will enhance, but
not block, the view of any sign or part thereof. All pedestal sign bases shall
be planted with shrubs or groundcover with a minimum height of eighteen
inches (unless this obscures the sign) at the time of planting. Healthy
vegetation which is preserved in the location of the signage landscape area
may be substituted for the required plantings.
Walls
Existing stone walls shall be retained in place (see District Setting) and
repaired as necessary. New free standing and/ or retaining walls are to be
constructed of unfinished rock and maintain a dry look. Walls may be veneer
or wet laid as long as no mortar is visible. Rocks found in the area are the
preferred material. Under no circumstances are wooden or masonry walls
permitted.
37
Fences
Hollis Village was built mainly in the 1800s, therefore the Commission
feels fencing in the District should be in keeping with the period of the
building. The purpose of the fencing must be clearly defined when applying
for a permit. Acceptable reasons include aesthetic, protection and privacy.
Accepted styles must be compatible with the period of the building.
A variety of incompatible connecting fences along a property line is
discouraged. A fence along the front of a building shall usually continue
with the same style of fencing on the property sidelines as far as is visible
from the right of way. Lattice fencing is encouraged for pool privacy. Chain
link, woven wood, and stockade fencing except for screening (see screening
p. 30) are all considered inappropriate.
In choosing the proper fence the following shall be considered: •
architectural period of the building; • neighboring properties; • existing
fences in the neighborhood; • height and style in relation to the building.
Picket fencing is considered appropriate for colonial buildings. The
following shall be used as a guideline for picket fences: • pickets shall
generally be painted white; • careful attention shall be given to the space
between pickets (pales).
The following are to be considered when applying for a fencing permit:
authentic reproductions are suitable, pleasant and enhance property values,
with few exceptions fences shall be painted white, fencing shall not restrict
views of neighbors, maximum height 4 feet
Change in Use
The HDC, being a conservation Commission, cannot regulate use, however
when zoning regulations permit a change in use, the HDC is responsible
for the external aesthetics connected with the change in use.
Whenever a change in use in the Historic District requires a change in
the exterior of the property or to the parcel of land, including traffic, parking,
odor or noise, these changes must be presented to the HDC for approval.
A change in use in regard to the change of tenants in a commercial
building in the Business District does not have to go before the HDC unless
the tenant requires changes to the exterior of the building or to the building's
signage.
38
Relocation
Buildings shall be retained on their present sites whenever possible.
Relocations shall be considered only as an alternative to demolition.
Demolition
It is expected that each property owner will maintain, preserve and improve
the qualities of his/her property whether undeveloped, business or
residential. Historically significant structures will be c;arefully evaluated
and should not be demolished. To prevent demolition all possible efforts
shall be made by the owner and by the HDC. If no solution is found with
120 days from the original hearing and a good faith effort has been shown
on the part of both owner and HDC, the permit for demolition will be
granted. The Historical Society shall be notified immediately by the HOC
of an application for demolition. During the 120 day period if there is
severe economic hardship, review of the possibility of Historic Trust or
Heritage Commission assistance shall be investigated by both owner and
HDC where the historic value indicates its appropriateness.
Demolition of any building or part of a building in the Historic District
shall be allowed only when new construction would relate better to the
Historic District, and when all other requirements below are satisfied.
• If a request for demolition is based on structural instability or
deterioration, the HDC may require a technical report prepared by an
architect or a registered professional engineer (credentials recognized in
NH) to be submitted detailing the nature and extent of the specific problems,
and providing reasonably accurate cost estimates for their correction.
• An application for demolition shall be accompanied by complete plans
for a new development proposed on the site, together with a timetable and
budget for both demolition and the new construction.
• A condition for approval of demolition shall be documentation by the
owner of the building's elevations and architectural features, through
measured drawings and photographs.
• Where public safety needs require the removal of part of a building or
complex, the Historic District Commission may allow limited removal
within structurally-sound construction and E.P.A. guidelines .
• In reviewing the application package, the Commission may request
reports and recommendations regarding the feasibility of the applicant's
proposal from the planning board, fire chief, building inspector, health
officer and other administrative officials who may possess information
concerning the impact of the proposal on the Historic District. In furtherance
of the review, the Commission may solicit advice from professional,
educational or other groups or persons as may be deemed necessary for
making reasonable decisions.
39
Non-Conforming Uses, Structures and Lots
Non-conforming (grandfathered) uses in the Historic District shall be
reviewed by the ZBAaccording to its regulations.
Temporary Structures
Definition: A structure, which by its type and or materials of construction
is erected or placed for not more than ninety days. Such structures shall
include, but not be limited to, tents, portable bandstands, bleachers,
reviewing stands, mobile home buildings used in conjunction with
construction activity, tractor trailers and other structures of similar character.
Temporary structures erected or placed in conjunction with licensed circuses
or carnivals or non-profit fund raising activities shall not be construed to
be temporary structures under this regulation.
Temporary structures shall be allowed provided they are placed for not
longer than 90 days. They shall be appropriate in size and style to the
purpose for which they are placed and shall be expeditiously reviewed by
the HOC. Seasonal temporary structures shall be permitted. Any structure
that is on site for longer than 90 days must get a building permit from the
appropriate Town department.
Procedure
A - Certificate of Approval
Notwithstanding any inconsistent ordinance, local law, code, rule or
regulation concerning the issuing of building permits, no change in any
architectural feature in the district shall be commenced without a certificate
of approval from the HDC nor shall any building permit for such change
be granted without such a certificate of approval having first been issued.
The certificate of approval required by this section shall be in addition to
and not in lieu of any building permit that may be required by any
ordinance, local law, code, rule or regulation of the Town of Hollis.
B - Pre Application Review Procedure
Prior to the preparation of working drawings and specifications or calling
for proposals of bids from contractors, prospective property developers,
owners or agents may prepare preliminary scale drawings and outline
specifications, including color samples for outside work, for review and
informal discussion with the Historic District Commission. The purpose
of this review shall be to acquaint the developer, owner, or agent with
standards of appropriateness of design that are required of his/her proposed
development. In the case of very minor projects involving repair or
alterations to existing buildings and where other data are sufficiently clear
and explicit, the HDC may grant preliminary and final approval at one
review session. Should said data indicate alterations, remodeling, or repairs
not changing the exterior appearance, tl1e HDC may exempt the application
from the provisions of "Procedure" and approve a permit.

Glossary - Adapted from Koetter and Kim, Architecture Dictionary
• Design Principles
Size: things are large or small in relative terms, in relation to both the
human body and other things. Absolute size is µsually less important than
relative size.
Scale: term widely used in design and architecture to describe a rather
subtle consideration related to size. It refers to the proper proportion of an
object or space to all otl1er objects, to human beings, and to the space to
which it belongs. Good scale is achieved by choosing elements that seem
to be of an appropriate size for the space t11ey will inhabit. Good scale is
indicated when things look so right that the issue does not even come to
mind. ·
Proportion: addresses the relationship of parts of a design to each other
and to the whole. Good proportion is considered a key requirement in any
aesthetic success. Achieving good proportions is less easy than recognizing
them, although many efforts have been made to develop systems for doing
so. One approach, using mathematical relationships analogous to the rules
of harmony in music, suggests organizing proportions according to
geometric ratios of simple whole numbers such as 1:2 and 2:3, 3:4 and 3:5.
Many architects including Palladio based their structures on such systems.
Other approaches, such as the Modular of LeCorbusier base dimensional
units on human body proportions and extend these through numerical
multiplication into a system. The Modular also makes use of a particular
mathematical relationship often referred to as the "Golden Ratio" or
"Golden Section" and designated by the Greek letter phi. It has had much
47
influence on design throughout history. The terms : golden mean, golden
ratio, and golden section all refer to a proportional relationship that satisfies
a certain requirement. with a high level of occurrence in nature. The
proportion of the Golden Section is 1:1.618 or approximately 5:8.
Balance: concerns the achievement of a state of equilibrium between forces.
Balanced relationships look normal, at rest, and comfortable. Unbalanced
relationships are tenuous and disturbing.
Rhythm: a concept borrowed from music, rhythm relates visual elements
together in a regular pattern. It can be achieved by repetition. The use of
rhythm - the choice of small or large units, close together or widely spaced
- should be appropriate to the situation. Since repetition can lead to
monotony, it must also be balanced against the need for variety.
Harmony: describes the combination of elements and other principles in a
way that produces consonance. In order to achieve harmony, all the varied
components, like the notes in a chord, must relate to each other and to the
overall theme of the design.
Unity: allows the viewer to experience a design as a whole rather than
seeing it as a collection of elements. All the parts of the design will relate
so well that they create a unit in which, ideally, nothing can be added,
taken away, or altered without changing the totality.
Variety: variety and contrast, the countervailing qualities to harmony and
unity, can relieve monotony, giving the eye a number of different shapes,
textures, colors, or details to look at.
Contrast: heightens values through comparison. A light color will seem
lighter if placed near a dark color, a large object larger in contrast with
something small. In this context, contrast and variety may be viewed as
ways to punctuate harmony and unity, heightening the space's overall
impact.
Emphasis: Ensures that important element look important while minor and
trivial elements look subordinate. This is achieved through balancing size,
placement, value, color and selection of materials. A large door centrally
placed becomes a point of focus. A brightly colored object in an otherwise
quiet space calls attention to itself.
• Design Elements
Space: something we cannot touch, but it inevitably is felt; we are within
and surrounded by space, and therefore a part of it.
Point: in geometry the point is simply a location in space; two points suggest
a beginning and an end and lead to the idea of a connecting line
Line: when a point moves through space or when two points are connected,
line is generated; may be straight or curved, has length but not breadth;
vertical suggest stability .. and by extension, dignity and permanence;
horizontal suggest rest, repose; diagonal suggest movement,dynamic forces
and activity.
Shape: two-dimensional connection of lines: triangles, squares, curvilinear.
Form: three-dimensional connection of lines: pyramids, cylinders, etc.
48
Color/hue: - red, yellow, green, blue, etc. Color saturation or intensity
refers to the degree of pureness of the hue - from very pure to very grayed.
- hue - is also modified by chroma (intensity or brilliance) and value.
Value: the amount of lightness or darkness, white is light and black is dark.
(When you compare white and gray, the gray is of darker value than the
white. When you compare gray to black the gray is of lighter value than
black.
Texture: surface quality, how something feels when we touch it, how it
looks when light touches it. There are two basic categories of texture: tactile
and visual.
Pattern: A patterned surface has visible presence in every part of its extent.
The fact that pattern is usually repetitious gives it rhythmic qualities on a
small scale. It can make a surface seem more or less important or a space
seem larger or smaller than it actually is. Stripes running vertically make a
surface seem narrower and higher, running horizontally, wider and lower.
Ornament: can be seen as an elaboration of texture. Refers to visual extras
unnecessary for practical reasons but added to show off craftsmanship,
introduce variety, and enrich a uniform surface. In all ornamentation the
key to value is the issue of meaning. Why is the ornament there: does it
add something or does it merely cover and confuse: good ornament
emphasizes what is important, draws attention to what is significant and
tells something about the materials and workmanship involved.
Materials: the actual physical substances of wl].ich things are made.
Mass: a grouping of individual parts or elements that compose a unified
body of unspecified size or quantity.
Visual Weight: large areas of dark colors have greater visual weight than
small areas of light colors. To achieve balance a small dark area would
need to be offset by a large light area.
• Architectural Terms
architrave: In the classical orders, the lowest member of the entablature,
the beam that spans from column to column, resting directly upon their
capitals.
awning: a temporary shelter from sun or other weather, made usually of
fabric, at first canvas, hung in and over windows, sloping to shed rain and
supported by gravity and a metal frame.
balloon frame: a structural system or framework evolved about 1830 using
standardized lightweight lumber where 2-x-4 studs extended from
foundation to roof. It replaced cumbersome heavy timber and braced
framing and was made possible by the availability of inexpensive nails.
baluster: a short post or spindle supporting a handrail on a stair or balcony
railing.
balustrade: a railing or parapet with balusters and railing, with or without
a base.
49
barge-board: a face board, often elaborately carved, attached to the
projecting edge of a gable roof. Also called a verge-board. Common to the
Gothic Revival, Elizabethan, and Tudor styles.

a building within a structural bay.
berm: a mound of earth used like a wall for planting, screening.
blinds: that which blinds light or vision usually by covering windows from
in-or outside; 18th-century louvered blinds (shutters) on the exterior of
"Colonial" buildings (usually Federal or Greek Revival) are revived today
as vestigial decorations, often plastic, usually immovable, and insufficient
in width to cover the opening they flank. Nineteenth-century blinds went
indoors and were recessed internal louvered blinds, covering similar
openings, but away from the weather.
bracket: any strut or angled support of a shelf, beam, overhang, or
projecting roof.

as siding on wood-framed buildings. It is often wedge shaped with the
narrower edge along the top and is called beveled siding.
classical: referring to the formal architectural styles of ancient Greece or
Rome or to the styles which derived from these prototypes.
Classical Revival: the general term for Greek and Roman revivals, where
literal use of Classical Greek and Roman building parts and assemblies
contrasts with the concurrent revival of Renaissance architecture that used
the same source materials to different ends.
Colonial: the period of a place's architecture in its historical status as a
colony, as in America or India or much of South America. Colonial
America's history ended (according to Americans) in 1776, at the moment
of the Declaration of Independence; according to Britain in 1783, the moment
of the peace treaty. Colonial (American), as a catchall, is applied popularly
to almost anything before the Civil War: particularly buildings and churches

which forms the base for the pediment. It consists of the architrave, the
frieze, and the cornice.
eyebrow dormer: a low, wide, sometimes curved-headed dormer window.
facade: the face of a building
fanlight: an arched transom over a door, usually with radial muntins.
fascia: a board that is nailed vertically to the ends of roof rafters, sometimes
supporting a gutter.
fence skirt: border of wood along the base of a fence on its street side
fenestration: the arrangement and design of windows in the facade of a
building.
frieze: the fom1al enriched and sculpted band within a Classical cornice
between the architrave, and the cornice (top or roof edge).

APPENDIX - 20th Century Architecture in Hollis
The 19th Century brought much change to the world of domestic
architecture. Instead of one sty;le being in vogue for a long period of time
during which it would evolve and progress into the next phase or style,
now many things were happening concurrently. Style periods overlapped,
construction methods changed, from timber framing to balloon framing,
making it possible to change the shapes of buildings. Architects and builders
both had an influence on the types and styles of buildings that were being
built. In the 20th Century, the pot was stirred even more vigorously.
Anything and everything was possible and it happened all at the same
time and all over the country.
From 1885-1940 we experienced a period of "Romantic" Revivals. It
seems as though every style of past centuries was brought back and tried
again although not necessarily with the same attention to scale, proportion
and authenticity of detail. Hollis escaped this trend to a great degree
perhaps because the town was small, rural and the population not
particularly affluent. Many of these styles have never existed in Hollis.
Some of these revival styles included:
Early Colonial Revival: 1895-1915 based on colonial prototypes, some
examples borrowed eighteenth-century details and applied them to
simplified Queen Anne buildings. The scale of the buildings was larger, as
53
were the windows. Paired windows with divided lights on the upper sash
only and a side porch are good clues to this style.
Neoclassical Revival: 1895-1950 Facade dominated by full-height
porch with roof supported by classical columns; columns typically have
Ionic or Corinthian capitals; facade shows symmetrically balanced windows
and center door. Hollis' Social Library is of this style, built in 1910.
Dutch Colonial: 1890-1930 Gambrel roof where one or both of the
lower slopes flare at the eaves in a gentle curve.
English Revival: based on medieval, Gothic or Tudor traditions,
(also referred to as Elizabethan 1910-1940 or Tudor 1890-1940). Half
timbered effect on second story, steeply pitched roof, large chimney stacks.
French Revival: based on the Norman farmhouse or small manor.
(French Rural 1915-1940).
Spanish Revival: Mediterranean, Spanish Mission 1890-1920,
Spanish Colonial Revival/Spanish Eclectic 1915-1940, Monterey 1925-1955.
Two 20th Century styles emerged which were developed by successful
architects. The first, the Prairie Style 1900-1920, popularized by Frank Lloyd
Wright, was a new and distinct regional style. This style "featured open
planning, shallow-pitched roofs with broad, sheltering overhangs; bands
of casement windows and a strong horizontal emphasis." The second, the
Craftsman Style, 1900-1930, originated in California and examples designed
the brothers Greene epitomize this style characterized by the rustic texture
of the building materials. The buildings are usually one story, with a lowpitched
gabled roof with wide, unenclosed eave overhang with exposed
rafter tails at the eaves. Porches were common, either full- or partial-width,
with roof supported by tapered square columns and often extensive
pergolas and trellises over the porches. The lower portion of a wall was
often battered or sloped near the ground. Natural materials used for exterior
and colors were earth tones.
Prairie and the Craftsman also translated into "Builder House Types".
These buildings were generally small in scale and low in cost. We know
the Prairie as the "American Foursquare" and the Craftsman as the
"Bungalow". These two types of buildings and others were offered to the
public through house plan books and ready-cut buildings.
Plans by Mail; buildings by Rail: Mail Order Designs, 1875-1940, were
promoted through plan books illustrating building plans. For a few dollars
the building plans and specifications could be ordered through the mail
and a carpenter or builder could construct from the plans. Sears, Roebuck,
Aladdin Redi-Cut and other manufacturers offered ready-cut buildings
ordered by mail and shipped by railroad anywhere in the country. The
building came complete with doors, trim, nails, paint and even plumbing.
Builder House Types 1900-1930: The Homestead, the Foursquare, the
Cottage, the Bungalow. We have examples of each in Hollis (See page 19).
CA
The Homestead: tall, narrow and deep, two story with a pitched roof, a
gable front and a porch. (108 Depot Road)
The Foursquare: four rooms square, two stories high, low hipped or
pyramidal roof and a porch. (5 Depot Road, 1917)
The Bungalow: small, long and low, one- or one-and-one-half story with
a conspicuous roof,overhanging eaves and an ample front porch included
under the main roof structure. Usually covered in shingles or shakes in
natural earth-tone colors. (3 Main Street, 1924)
The Cottage: One- or one-and-one-half story with a larger upstairs than
the bungalow. Cottages are more vertically oriented than the bungalow
and may have Colonial-era details. (81 Main Street)
Sears Mail Order Building: the Cobblers Shop (31 Main Street).
Postwar Building Types:
After WWII two new building "types" emerged. Both became very popular
and Hollis has a number of examples of each.
The Ranch House: one story, pitched roof, no steps, indoor I outdoor
living, open floor plan, sliding glass doors, picture windows. (72 Main
Street, 1955)
The Split Level: Multiple levels, garage on lower level, pitched roof, sixover-
six double hung sash windows, picture window, paneled shutters.
(31 Proctor Hill Road, 105 Depot Road)
Postwar Building Styles: From about 1950 to ~e present there has again
been a revival of the revival styles that marked the beginning of the Century.
These include: the Neo-Colonial Revival, the Mansard, the Neo-French,
the Neo-Tudor, the Neo-Mediterranean, the Neo-Victorian and a new type
of French Rural (1915-1940). We are also seeing new buildings reminiscent
of the Shingle Style (Richardson Road) and the French Chateauesque (1885-
1910) (Richardson Road). For better or for worse, Hollis has participated
in this resurgence and a drive along many of our country roads or through
new subdivision developments will show examples of a number of these
eclectic styles which on the whole do not integrate well with our earlier,
more traditional New England styles of architecture with their simplicity
of line. This introduction of architectural styles that are not "regional" in
nature dilutes the small-town, rural character or "look" of Hollis and is an
issue that shall be given thoughtful consideration (see New Construction).
Popular House Styles 1945 to 1990s. A brief look at some of the other
building styles that are popular throughout the country and which may be
found here in Hollis, too, follows. Quotes are taken from American House
Styles, a concise guide, by architect John Milnes Baker, A.I.A., W.W. Norton
and Company, Inc., 1994. (HOC Reference Library. See Baker's drawings
of each of the following styles, pp 148-157). Some styles were originated
by architects and perhaps later adapted by builders; others come straight
from building plan books to be built by local builders either as spec
55
buildings or for clients looking for a "modern" home. Many are pale
reflections of their original prototypes.
Minimal Traditional 1935-1950 "A compromise style of the
Depression years. Usually one story or one-and-a-half stories, multigabled
with little or no decorative details. Often suggestive of the Tudor buildings
of the 1920s with a front facing gable and a fairly large chimney but with a
much shallower roof pitch.
Neo-Colonial Revival: 1950-1970 "The real-estate developer's staple.
Roof pitches are usually too low and windows badly proportioned unlike
the Colonial Revival buildings of the 1920' s. (They have) aluminum siding,
fixed vinyl blinds, and a little brick veneer to dress up the entrance side."
Williamsburg Colonial 1950-1990s "Colonial Williamsburg opened
in the early 1930s and this one-and-one-half-story Southern Colonial has
been popular ever since. With symmetrical facades and fairly steeply pitched
roofs with dormers, these buildings are usually of either clapboard or brick."
Builder's Contemporary 1960-1985 "Builders adopted the simplified
details and massing of architects' contemporary designs. Vertical siding or
clapboards with natural stains, large windows, and numerous skylights
were all characteristic of the style. Roofs were usually hipped or hipped in
combination with low-pitched gables."
Mansard 1960-1990s "The modern builder's interpretation of the
French roof was another cliche' that caught on in the 1960's and is still
fairly common. It bears little resemblance to the Second Empire style of
the 1870's. Smooth stucco walls with decorative quoins, double front doors,
and arched windows with louvered blinds are typical features of this style."
Neo-Shingle 1960-1980 "An unfortunate term given to the first of
the so-called Postmodern variations, these architect-designed buildings
derived from vernacular prototypes and often used shingles. Though
sometimes crisp and unselfconscious, they were more often obtuse and
perversely iconoclastic, disdaining convention in favor of mannered
eccentricity."
Builder's Shed 1965-1980s "The multidirectional shed roof-a
vernacular form-was widely used by architects in the 1960s and was soon
imitated by builders across the country. Diagonal siding with brown stain
and aluminum sliding windows were typical. Usually there was no
projecting overhang or fascia at the eaves and the massing was often
complex."
Postmodern 1960-1990s "The term applies to any of the architectdesigned
buildings that incorporate details and features from a checklist
of trendy cliches. Stylized classical references and vernacular buildings
blend in an amalgamation of affectation. Pastel colors, stripes, and
eccentricity characterize the style."
Neo-Classical Revival: 1965-1990s "Neo-Neoclassical Revival would
be a better term. The two-story portico is the key feature of this style. The
disfigured classical orders are inept reflections of the early nineteenth
56
century and turn-of-the-century prototypes. "
Neo-Tudor 1965-1990s "Tudor" is usually applied to almost any
front-gabled building with a steeply pitched roof, a prominent chimney,
and fake half-timbered boards. These buildings are rarely built of stone as
the more "authentic" Tudors were in the 1920s. "
Neo-Mediterranean 1970-1990s "The term applies to almost any
vaguely Spanish or Italian Renaissance building with a red tile roof (usually
simulated), stuccoed walls, some round arched windows and doors, and a
fancy front door. Common in the former Spanish territories of California,
the Southwest, and Florida, they are inappropriately built throughout the
country."
Neo-French Eclectic 1975-1990s "The revival of various "traditional"
styles in the 1970s heralded a rejection of modern architecture and a search
for a more pretentious old-house look. The segmented arches over the
windows and doors and the decorative quoins are characteristics of this
style. Front doors are apt to be elaborately embellished with classical
motifs."
Nouveau Traditional 1980s-1990s "No style has yet evolved that so
grossly and blatantly expresses the ostentations and pretentious excesses
of an era"
Neo-Victorian 1980-1990s "Renewed interest in Queen Anne
buildings of the late nineteenth century has launched the usual surge of
imitations. Some of the excesses of the 1980s found expression in the revival
of elaborate spindlework, scrolls and brackets and the architectural
vocabulary of the late Victorian era.
1990s Shingle: Emphasis on the horizontal axis, shingles wrap
around the building. 1
American Vernacular Revival 1980-1990s "Unpretentious regional
architecture can be an excellent starting point for new designs for our era.
examples of massing of rooms
57
Good planning can comfortably complement the vernacular folk
architecture of the disparate parts of this country to create contemporary
buildings that will never seem dated."
