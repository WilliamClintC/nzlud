codification and general revision of its ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before

by the Mayor and the Clerk, attached to this Ordinance as a part hereof, and
filed with the permanent records of the City of Delphos, Ohio.
   SECTION 2. That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions
of the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 4 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to April 5, 1982, which are inconsistent with any provision of
the Codified Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this
Ordinance except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06. The code and
chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding the
first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all digits
left of the decimal. The section number appears right of the decimal. As
another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number is
113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion. Codes, titles and chapters initially
are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation. Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code. Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created
575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be placed in
their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections without histories indicate that
the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting Ordinance
which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances. It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections. Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

unless there are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the
period ends on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)    The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall
be computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on

office, in which an act required by law is to be performed, is closed to the
public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for doing such act or
before its usual closing time on such day, then such act may be performed on

   (f)    Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)    The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)    An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)    The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not,
except as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)    Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)    Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)    Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)    Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)    If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced
by a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)    A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re- enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)    If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)    Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   101.06  CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)    If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)    If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)    (1)    If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)    If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made  by each cannot reasonably be put
into simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)    In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)    Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)    The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)    A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)    A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)    An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   
   (c)    If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)    The object sought to be attained;
      (2)    The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)    The legislative history; 
      (4)    The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)    The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)    The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00). A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   139.02  PAYMENT PLANS FOR UTILITY CUSTOMERS.
   (a)    Monthly Payments for Service Rendered.
      (1)    Any residential customer desiring to pay their utility bill in
monthly installments may do so providing they fill out a form requesting such
payment plan. This form must be filled out in advance of payment and must be
submitted to the Utilities Office no later than five days after the first date
of the collection period to allow the Utilities Clerk time to process the
request. Requests made after this time period will be denied. This form must be
filled out each quarter the customer desires to take advantage of this program.
      (2)    The customer will agree to pay not less than one-third of the
amount of the bill in the first month the bill is due; not less than one-half
the amount due in the second month; and any outstanding balance in the third
month. Any amounts less than these amounts will be construed as outstanding
balances. Due dates will be by the fifteenth of the month, or by the first
normal working day after the fifteenth which may fall on a weekend or legal
holiday.
      (3)    There will be no fee assessed for the first month of this
privilege, there will be three dollar ($3.00) fee for each of the second and
third month payments. Payments under this plan are for water used and service
rendered according to the schedule of the billing date. Such fee covers the
additional labor costs of processing the bills on a monthly basis.
      (4)    The Utilities Office will not be responsible to the customer for
the monthly payment program; it will be the customers' responsibility to insure
the monthly payments are made in a timely fashion. Under this plan the
Utilities Office will not send out monthly notices.
      (5)    Customers who are delinquent in their monthly payments will be
assessed a ten percent (10%) penalty on any outstanding balance. Service will
be terminated if the bill is not paid in full by the closing date of the
collection period. Service will not be resumed until the entire outstanding
balance is paid in full.
      (6)    Customers who are delinquent in their quarterly bill will be
required to make monthly payments as per this section and shall be assessed a
ten percent (10%) penalty on any outstanding balance. Customers with a history
of delinquency will be required to be on the monthly payment program. History
of delinquency will be construed as those accounts that have been delinquent
for at least two quarters in the previous four quarters.
      (7)    For purposes of accounting, when each one-third of the bill is
paid, the appropriate portion of the bill will be deposited into each fund as
designated on the entire bill; with each fund receiving its proportional share.
The three dollar ($3.00) service fee will be deposited into the Water
Department Fund number 43.
      (8)    The Waterworks Clerk is hereby authorized to act as the City's
agent in the processing and handling of this program; as outlined above.
   (b)    Monthly Payments in Advance of Service Rendered.
      (1)   Customers desiring to make monthly payments in advance shall be
permitted to do so. Payment in advance shall be computed on the average of the
last four quarters and payable in three monthly installments where the third
payment will be for any outstanding balance due. Payments made under this
program will not be charged a monthly service fee as a trade-off between the
assessed interest of the credit balance against the added cost of processing
the bill.
      (2)   Customers desiring this method of payment will be required to fill
out a form requesting this option. This form must be filled out in advance of
payment and must be submitted to the Utilities Office no later than five days
after the first date of the collection period to allow the Utilities Clerk time
to process the request. This service will not be granted if the request is made
after the deadline date of the quarter in effect at the time. This form must be
filled out each quarter the customer desires to take advantage of this program.
      (3)    Failure to make monthly payments in the prescribed amount when due
will not be cause for delinquent fees to be assessed, however, the customer may
be denied this option in subsequent quarters.
   (c)    Responsibility for Payment.  Under the aforementioned options, the
City of Delphos takes no responsibility in the payment of the customers'
utilities bill. The customer retains the ultimate responsibility to insure that
the bill is paid in a timely fashion.
   (d)    Options.  This payment plan shall be available in addition to those
provisions currently contained in Chapter

TITLE SEVEN - Judicial
Chap.
171. Mayor's Court
CHAPTER 171
Mayor's Court
   EDITOR'S NOTE: The Mayor has jurisdiction to hear and determine any
prosecution for the violation of a Municipal ordinance, and has jurisdiction in
all criminal causes involving moving traffic violations occurring on State
highways located within the corporate limits, subject to the right of the
defendant to trial by jury and before an impartial magistrate.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Municipal ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00). Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and
Criminal Rule 23(A) provide that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him and shall be transferred to a court of record in the County if the
defendant:
   (a)    Does not waive his right to  trial by jury in a serious offense case
for which the penalty established by law includes confinement for more than six
months, or
   (b)    Demands a jury trial in a petty offense case in which the penalty 
prescribed is a fine greater than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00) and/or
imprisonment for not more than six months. "Such demand must be in writing and
filed with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the date set for
trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice of the date
set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to demand a jury trial as provided
in this subdivision is a complete waiver of the right thereto."
   In Ward v. Village of Monroeville, Ohio, 93 S. Ct. 80 (1972), the United
States Supreme Court held that where the mayor before whom the defendant was
compelled to stand trial was responsible for municipal finances and the mayor's
court provided a substantial portion of municipal revenues, defendant was
denied a trial before a disinterested and impartial  magistrate as guaranteed
by the due process clause of the United States Constitution.
   The Supreme Court of Ohio has adopted the "Ohio Traffic Rules" which
prescribe the procedure to be followed in the Mayor's Court in traffic cases.
Rule 9(A) thereof states the jury demand shall be made pursuant to Criminal
Rule 23 referred to above. Rule 9(B) sets forth the conditions under which the
Mayor may hear a traffic case incorporating therein the holding in Ward v.
Village of Monroeville as further interpreted in State, ex ref. Brockman v.
Procter, 35 Ohio St. 2d 79 (1973): "Where, in a mayor's court, a defendant is
entitled to a jury trial and a jury demand is made pursuant to Criminal Rule
23, the Mayor shall transfer the case pursuant to subdivision (C). If a jury
demand is not made pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and (or?) the defendant waives
his right to jury trial in writing, a mayor may try the case if (1) his
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he is not the chief executive and administrative officer of
the municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition of the
municipality. Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any mayor including
mayors whose compensation as a judge is directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions and mayors who as chief executive and administrative officer of the
municipality are responsible for the financial condition of the municipality."
   The procedure for transferring a case to a court of record is set forth in
Rule 9(C): "Where a transfer is required, the mayor's court shall make a
written order directing the defendant to appear at the transferee court,
continuing the same bail, if any, and making appearance before the transferee
court a condition of bail, if any. Upon transfer, the mayor's court shall
transmit to the clerk of the transferee court the ticket and all other papers
in the case, and any bail taken in the case. Upon receipt of such papers the
clerk of the transferee court shall set the case for trial and shall notify the
defendant by ordinary mail of his trial date."
   Rule 13 provides that a court shall establish a traffic violation bureau and
specifies certain restrictions as to the designated offenses and schedule of
fines to be accepted as waiver payment in lieu of court appearance.

rate of ten dollars ($10.00) per day. Such work and labor in the aforesaid

         A.   Any portion of the tax so due which shall have been deducted at
the source pursuant to the provisions of  Section
181.06; and
         B.   Any portion of said tax which shall have been paid by the
taxpayer pursuant to the provision of Section
181.07; and
         C.   Credit to the extent allowed by Section

Delphos is entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such
overpayment applied against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his
election indicated on the return, such overpayment, (or part thereof) shall be
refunded; provided that no additional taxes or refunds of less than ($1.01)
shall be collected or refunded.
      (3)   The mere submission of a return reporting a tax liability shall not
constitute filing unless accompanied by the required payment.
   (e)   (1)   Where necessary an amended return must be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in

liability affecting the taxpayer's tax liability, to the City, such taxpayer

         (Ord. 2009-54.  Passed 11-24-09.)
   181.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)   Withholding by Employer:  Each employer within, or doing business
within, the City of Delphos who employs one or more persons on a salary, wage,
commission or other compensation basis shall deduct, when such salary, wage,
commission or other compensation is paid, allocated, apportioned or set aside,
the tax at the rate provided in Section
181.03 hereof on the qualifying wages due by such employer to each such
employee and shall, on or before the last day of the month following such
withholding, make a return and pay to the Administrator the amount of taxes so
deducted.  The return shall be on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable
to the Administrator and shall be subject to the Rules and Regulations
prescribed by the Administrator.  Such employer shall be liable for the payment
of the tax required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not such taxes have
in fact been withheld.
   (b)   An employer is not required to make any withholding with respect to an
individual's disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the
time of the disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued.    
   (c)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer to withhold the tax as required by a municipal
corporation or by the employer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the
tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer to remit to the municipal corporation
the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for that tax unless the
employee colluded with the employer in connection with the failure to remit the
tax withheld.
   (d)   So long as the taxes withheld by an employer for the City of Delphos
during the measurement period are less than one thousand dollars ($1,000) per
month, payments may be made quarterly on or before the last day of the month
following the end of each quarter, subject to the approval of the
Administrator.  The Administrator may revoke the approval of quarterly filing
and payments whenever the Administrator has reason to believe that the
conditions for granting such authorization have changed, were judged
incorrectly, were not met, or when it is in the best interest of the City of
Delphos to do so.  Notice of withdrawal shall be made in writing and in such
case, the employer must begin to file in accordance with this section.
   (e)   Employer Considered as Trustee.  Each employer in collecting such tax
shall be deemed to hold the same, until payment is made by such employer to the
City of Delphos, as a trustee for the benefit of the City of Delphos, and any
such tax collected by such employer from his employees shall, until the same is
paid to the City of Delphos, be deemed a trust fund in the hands of such
employer.  Each employer shall be liable for the payment of the tax required to
be deducted and withheld, whether or not such tax, in fact, has been withheld.
   (f)   Any person who is required to withhold tax from qualifying wages shall
pay all such tax to the City of Delphos in accordance with the provisions of
this section.  In the event taxes withheld from the qualifying wages of
employees are not paid to the City of Delphos in accordance with the provisions
of this section, all officers, members, managers, employees, and trustees
having control or supervision of or charged with the responsibility of filing
the return and making payment are jointly and severally personally liable for
the tax not returned or paid to the City of Delphos as well as any related
interest and penalties, and are also liable under the provisions of Section
181.99 hereof.  The dissolution, termination, or bankruptcy of a corporation,
limited liability company, or business trust does not discharge an officer's,
member's, manager's, employee's, or trustee's liability for a failure of the
corporation, limited liability company, or business trust to file returns or
pay said taxes.
   (g)     Withholding Return; List of Employees.  Each employer shall file a
withholding tax reconciliation showing the sum total of all compensation paid
all employees, the portion of which, (if any) was not subject to withholding
along with an explanation for same, and the portion of which was subject to
withholding, together with the amount of such withholdings remitted.  Such
return shall include information concerning each employee from whom the
municipal tax was withheld, showing the name, address, zip code and social
security number of each such employee, the total amount of compensation paid
during the year and the amount of municipal tax withheld.  If the total tax
withheld from any employee includes tax withheld and remitted to another
municipality, the amount of same shall be separately shown on the return of 
information to the City of Delphos concerning each employee.  The withholding
tax reconciliation shall be filed by each employer on or before February 28
following the end of such calendar year.
   (h)     In addition to the wage reporting requirements of this section, any
person required by the Internal Revenue Service to report on Form 1099-Misc
payments to individuals not treated as employees for services performed shall
also report such payments to the City of Delphos when the services were
performed in the City of Delphos. The information may be submitted on a
listing, and shall include the name, address and social security number (or
federal identification number), and the amount of the payments made.  Federal
form(s) 1099 may be submitted in lieu of such listing.  The information shall
be filed annually on or before February 28 following the end of such calendar
year.
   (i)    Domestic Servants.   No person shall be required to withhold the tax
on the qualifying wages, commissions, other compensation, and other taxable
income paid domestic servants employed exclusively in or about such person's
residence.  However, such domestic servants shall be responsible for filing and
paying their own returns and taxes.   
(Ord. 2009-54.  Passed 11-24-09.)

remitted to another taxing municipality.

including provisions for the reexamination and correction of returns.
      (1)    The Administrator is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,

conditions, he is unable to pay the full amount of the tax due. Such
authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by him under this chapter.
      (2)    Failure to make any deferred payment when due, shall cause the

so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any.

to examine the books, papers, records and federal income tax returns of any
employer or of any taxpayer or person subject to, or whom the Administrator
believes is subject to the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of
verifying the accuracy of any return made, or, if no return was made, to
ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Every employer, supposed employer,
taxpayer or supposed taxpayer is hereby directed and required to furnish upon
written request by the Administrator, or his duly authorized agent or employee,
the means, facilities, and opportunity for making such examinations and
investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Administrator is hereby authorized to order any person presumed
to have knowledge of the facts to appear before him and may examine such

order or subpoena of the Administrator authorized hereby shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section

   (e)   Every taxpayer shall retain all records necessary to compute the tax
liability for a period of five years from the date his return is filed, or the

thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars, or if the total amount of taxes
deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the
Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars.  Payments under division (B)(1)(b) of this section shall be
made to the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of
each month.
            (Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-7-16.)
   (C)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator.  A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the  Municipality requires all resident individual
taxpayers to file a tax return under Section
182.091 of this Chapter.
   (D)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (E)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required  under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (F)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (G)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (H)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a Withholding Reconciliation Return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and social security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (I)    The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (J)    An employer is required to deduct and withhold municipal income tax
on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (K)    A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this Chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

   If there is not a single municipal corporation in which the employee spent

behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (B)(1)(a) of this section among those two or more municipal
corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and reasonable
method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among such municipal
corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales made by the
employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal corporation to which
qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall be the employee's
"principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying wages for the
purposes of this section.
   For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee spends
a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division (B)(2) of this
section, except that "location" shall be substituted for "municipal
corporation" wherever "municipal corporation" appears in that division.
   (B)   (1)   Subject to divisions (C), (E), and (F) of this section, an
employer is not required to withhold municipal income tax on qualifying wages
paid to an employee for the performance of personal services in a municipal

one of the following conditions applies:
         (a)   The employee's principal place of work is located in the

than twenty days of actual services to complete the services;
            (ii)   The agreement between the employer and its customer to
perform services at a location requires the employer to perform actual services
at the location for more than twenty days.
         (c)   The employee is a resident of the Municipality and has requested
that the employer withhold tax from the employee's qualifying wages as provided
in Section
182.051 of this Chapter.
         (d)   The employee is a professional athlete, professional
entertainer, or public figure, and the qualifying wages are paid for the
performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (B)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day.  For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         (a)   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         (b)   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         (c)    Traveling from any location to another location in order to
pick up or load, for the purpose of transportation or delivery, property that
has been purchased, sold, assembled, fabricated, repaired, refurbished,
processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
         (d)   Transporting or delivering property described in division (B)(2)
(c) of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the employee
does not temporarily or permanently affix the property to real estate owned,
used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
         (e)   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (C)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (B)
(1) of this section shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's
qualifying wages described in that division, the employer withholds and remits
tax on such qualifying wages to the municipal corporation in which the
employee's principal place of work is located.
   (D)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D)(2) of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (B)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (D)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (D)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (E)    Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
182.03 of this Chapter. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small
employer for a taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to
provide the Tax Administrator with the employer's federal income tax return for
the preceding taxable year.
   (F)    Divisions (B)(1) and (D) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
182.051 of this Chapter.

providing the name, address, and social security number of the person from
whose winnings amounts were deducted and withheld, the amount of each such
deduction and withholding during the preceding calendar month, the amount of

the Tax Administrator. With this return, the casino operator shall remit
electronically to the Municipality all amounts deducted and withheld during the

deducted and withheld shall be personally liable for the amount withheld and
not remitted. Such personal liability extends to any penalty and interest
imposed for the late filing of a return or the late payment of tax deducted and
withheld.

until the predecessor casino operator produces either of the following:
         (a)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
         (b)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no
amounts are due.
If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is personally
liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and penalties and
interest thereon.
      (6)   The failure of a casino operator to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's winnings does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to those winnings.
   (D)    If a person's prize award from a video lottery terminal is an amount
for which reporting to the internal revenue service is required by section 6041
of the Internal Revenue Code, as amended, the video lottery sales agent shall

other information required by the Tax Administrator. With the return, the video
lottery sales agent shall remit electronically to the Tax Administrator all
amounts deducted and withheld during the preceding month.
      (3)   A video lottery sales agent shall maintain a record of all receipts
issued under division (E) of this section and shall make those records
available to the Tax Administrator upon request. Such records shall be
maintained in accordance with section 5747.17 of the Ohio Revised Code and any
rules adopted pursuant thereto.
      (4)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, each video
lottery terminal sales agent shall file an annual return electronically with
the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation in which the facility is
located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year. The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted. If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was
omitted on a monthly return for that reporting period, that information shall
be indicated on the annual return.
      (5)   Annually, on or before the thirty-first day of January, a video

lottery sales agent during the preceding year. A video lottery sales agent
shall provide to the Tax Administrator of the municipal corporation a copy of
each information return issued under this division. The Tax Administrator may
require that such copies be transmitted electronically.
      (6)   A video lottery sales agent who fails to file a return and remit

deducted and withheld.
   (F)    If a video lottery sales agent ceases to operate video lottery
terminals, the amounts deducted and withheld along with any penalties and
interest thereon are immediately due and payable. The successor of the video

following:
      (1)   A receipt from the Tax Administrator showing that the amounts
deducted and withheld and penalties and interest thereon have been paid;
      (2)   A certificate from the Tax Administrator indicating that no amounts
are due.
   If the successor fails to withhold purchase money, the successor is
personally liable for the payment of the amounts deducted and withheld and
penalties and interest thereon.
   (G)    The failure of a video lottery sales agent to deduct and withhold the
required amount from a person's prize award does not relieve that person from
liability for the municipal income tax with respect to that prize award.
   (H)    If a casino operator or lottery sales agent files a return late,
fails to file a return, remits amounts deducted and withheld late, or fails to
remit amounts deducted and withheld as required under this section, the Tax

182.061 DETERMINING MUNICIPAL TAXABLE INCOME FOR TAXPAYERS WHO ARE NOT
INDIVIDUALS
   "Municipal Taxable Income" for a taxpayer who is not an individual for the
Municipality is calculated as follows:
   (A)   "Income" reduced by "Exempt Income" to the extent otherwise included
in income, multiplied by apportionment, further reduced by any "Pre-2017 Net
Operating Loss Carryforward" equals "Municipal Taxable Income".
      (1)   "Income" for a taxpayer that is not an individual means the "Net
Profit" of the taxpayer. 
         (i)   "Net Profit" for a person other than an individual is defined in
Section
182.03(23). 
         (ii)   "Adjusted Federal Taxable Income" is defined in Section
182.03(1) of this Chapter.
      (2)   "Exempt Income" is defined in Section

the Municipality unless the taxpayer is an individual who resides in the
Municipality or the taxpayer is an electric company, combined company, or
telephone company that is subject to and required to file reports under Chapter
5745 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (A)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and

the same proportion as the average ratio of the following:
      (1)   The average original cost of the real property and tangible
personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Municipality during the taxable period to the average original cost of
all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in
the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
      (2)   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Municipality to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid
during the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession,

which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.052 of this Chapter;
      (3)   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Municipality to total gross receipts of the business or profession during the
same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
   (B)   (1)   If the apportionment factors described in division (A) of this
section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business activity in
the Municipality, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any
portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method
involving one or more of the following:
         (a)    Separate accounting;
         (b)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
         (c)   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
Municipality;
         (d)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
      (2)   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method shall
be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by division (A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (B)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by division
(A) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter.
      (4)   Nothing in division (B) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
   (C)   As used in division (A)(2) of this section, "wages, salaries, and

related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;
         (c)   A vendor, customer, client, or patient of a person described in
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, or a related member of such a vendor,
customer, client, or patient.
      (2)   Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (C)(1) or (2) of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax liability. If a
Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.    
   (D)   For the purposes of division (A)(3) of this section, receipts from
sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
      (1)   Gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation only if, regardless of where title passes,

         (a)   The property is shipped to or delivered within the municipal
corporation from a stock of goods located within the municipal corporation.
         (b)   The property is delivered within the municipal corporation from
a location outside the municipal corporation, provided the taxpayer is
regularly engaged through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of
sales within such municipal corporation and the sales result from such
solicitation or promotion.
      (2)   Gross receipts from the sale of services shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation to the extent that such services are performed in the
municipal corporation.
      (3)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from the sale of
real property located in the municipal corporation shall be sitused to the
municipal corporation.
      (4)   To the extent included in income, gross receipts from rents and
royalties from real property located in the municipal corporation shall be
sitused to the municipal corporation.
      (5)   Gross receipts from rents and royalties from tangible personal
property shall be sitused to the municipal corporation based upon the extent to
which the tangible personal property is used in the municipal corporation.
   (E)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental of
real estate owned directly by the individual or by a disregarded entity owned
by the individual shall be subject to tax only by the municipal corporation in
which the property generating the net profit is located and the municipal
corporation in which the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit
resides.
A municipal corporation shall allow such taxpayers to elect to use separate
accounting for the purpose of calculating net profit sitused under this
division to the municipal corporation in which the property is located.

that municipal corporation.  In no case shall a taxpayer be required to add to
its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal corporation any amount
other than the amount upon which the employee would be required to pay tax were

purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation. If the entity's net profit or loss is so

         (a)   The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.062 of this Chapter, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of
the pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to a municipal corporation;
         (b)   The pass-through entity shall be subject to municipal income

date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.

"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which

denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which

be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the

      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation. (Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)

   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the

representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the

annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service
form 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return or refund request, any
other documentation necessary to support the refund request or the adjustments
made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer who files the annual return
required by this section electronically is not required to provide paper copies
of any of the foregoing to the Tax Administrator unless the Tax Administrator
requests such copies after the return has been filed.   
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-
REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect to an amended tax return or
refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund request
or the adjustments made in the amended return.
      (4)   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio business gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio business gateway or a
portal provided by Municipality. The department of taxation shall publish a
method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio business gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator. 
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (F) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (G)   (1)    (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of state individual income tax returns under division
(G) of section 5747.08 of the Ohio Revised Code. The taxpayer shall complete
and file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or
on generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or
Tax Administrator.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit income tax return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer
that is not an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the tax
administrator on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the
end of the taxpayer's taxable year or period.  The taxpayer shall complete and
file the return or notice on forms prescribed by the tax administrator or on
generic forms, together with remittance made payable to the Municipality or Tax
Administrator.
         (c)   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual,  no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
182.092 of this Chapter applies, to the extent that any provision in this
division conflicts with any provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter, the provision in Section
182.092 of this Chapter prevails. 
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) and (4) of this
section.
   (I)     (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to
be filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on
or before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period
or that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement, or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment under this Chapter is made by electronic funds
transfer, the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the
timestamp assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.  For
purposes of this section, "receiving that payment" refers to the transfer of
funds from the account of the taxpayer.  Such funds are no longer under the
control of the taxpayer once the timestamp has occurred.
         (Ord. 2016-21.  Passed 11-7-16.)
   (J)    The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent
of an employer, or other payer as described in Section
182.051 of this Chapter shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation
as credits against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the
amounts withheld were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient
colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the
failure to remit the amounts withheld. 
   (K)    Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person.    Authorization by the taxpayer
of another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (L)    The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this Chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this Chapter and of the
Municipality's Ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (M)     When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (N)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
182.052 of this chapter.
      (2)   A person may notify a tax administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         (a)   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. 
The tax administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer
who has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         (b)   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that briefly
explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the previous
worksite location and the last date on which the person performed services or
made any sales within the municipal corporation.  The affidavit also shall
include the following statement:  "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules."  The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (N)(2) of
this section, the tax administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the tax administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year.  It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with
the provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of
municipal taxable income on an annual municipal income tax return, even if an
affidavit has been filed with the tax administrator for the taxable year. 
Nothing in division (N) of this section prohibits the tax administrator from
performing an audit of the person.
            (Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)

   (A)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an
extension of time for payment of taxes required by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter during the period of the member's or civilian's
duty service and for one hundred eighty days thereafter. The application shall
be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after the member's or
civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax
Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the one hundred eighty-first day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates. Except as provided in division
(B)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms
as the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality  before the one hundred eighty-first day
after the applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (B)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (C)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (A) and (B) of this section.
      (2)   (a)   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (C)(2)(a)
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces.
         (b)   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (C)(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension
period. Such taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of
the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (D)    For each taxable year to which division (A), (B), or (C) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (B)(2) and (3) or
(C) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that
year. 
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.093 USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (A)     Any taxpayer subject to municipal income taxation with respect to
the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any municipal
income tax return or, estimated municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (B)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (C)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (D)     The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,
taxpayers, or other persons does not affect the legal rights of municipalities
or taxpayers as otherwise permitted by law.  The State of Ohio shall not be a
party to the administration of municipal income taxes or to an appeal of a
municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (E)     Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing
the authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce
the provisions of its municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.094 EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (A)     Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal income tax
return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates.
   (B)     Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a municipal
income tax return.  The extended due date of the municipal income tax return
shall be the same as that of the extended federal income tax return.
   (C)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may request that the tax
administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's municipal income tax return.  If the request is received by the
tax administrator on or before the date the municipal income tax return is due,
the tax administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (D)     An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension
of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension
of that date.
   (E)     If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing state income tax returns under division (G) of section 5747.08 of the
Ohio Revised Code, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the
filing of a municipal income tax return.  The extended due date of the
municipal income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the

182.095 AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)    (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any federal or
state tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject
to the municipal income tax based upon such final determination of federal or
state tax liability, and pay any additional municipal income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is ten dollars or less.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return. Except as
provided under division (B)(2) of this section, the amended return shall not
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless the
applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
182.19 of this Chapter  has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
   (C)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (A)(2) of Section
182.19 of this Chapter  for filing the amended return even if it is filed

requirements of that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars or
less, no refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set
forth in division (C)(2) of this section, a request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
182.096 of this Chapter. Except as set forth in division (C)(2) of this
section, the request shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or
attachments that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.096 REFUNDS.
   (A)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator of the
Municipality, in accordance with this section, shall refund to employers,
agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of more than ten dollars;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars.
   (B)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing.  Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and / or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses. 
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (B)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.18 of this Chapter.
   (C)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (B) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (D)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
division (A)(4) of Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
   (E)     As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as

a written description of the roles of the Tax Administrator and of the taxpayer
during an audit and a statement of the taxpayer's rights, including any right
to obtain a refund of an overpayment of tax.  At or before the commencement of
an audit, the Tax Administrator shall inform the taxpayer when the audit is
considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner. This division does
not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest arising from
the audit.

182.12  ROUNDING.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds
fifty cents shall be rounded to the next whole dollar, and any fractional part
of a dollar that is less than fifty cents shall be dropped, rounding down to
the nearest whole dollar.  If a person chooses to round amounts entered on a
document, the person shall round all amounts entered on the document. 
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.13  AUTHORITY AND POWERS OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
182.131 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; ADMINISTRATIVE POWERS OF THE TAX
ADMINISTRATOR.
   The Tax Administrator has the authority to perform all duties and functions

issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of

respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under a municipal corporation
income tax ordinance or resolution adopted in accordance with this chapter;
   (B)    Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;

penalties and interest thereon, illegally or erroneously imposed or collected,
or for any other reason overpaid, and, in addition, the Tax Administrator may
investigate any claim of overpayment and make a written statement of the Tax

Administrator shall not review, redetermine, or correct any tax finding,

other appropriate tribunal, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by
the appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
   (H)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner

      (Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.132 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; COMPROMISE OF CLAIM AND PAYMENT OVER
TIME.
   (A)     As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action
is in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and
conditions as the Tax Administrator may require.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall inure to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (F)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized.  The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a  payment-over-time agreement. 
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.133 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (A)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this Chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this Chapter.  Upon written request by
the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and federal
and state income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (B)    The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this Chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was
or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to affect
such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (D)    No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or federal and state income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.134 AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; REQUIRING IDENTIFYING INFORMATION.
   (A)    The Tax Administrator may require any person filing a tax document
with the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information, which may
include the person's social security number, federal employer identification
number, or other identification number requested by the Tax Administrator. A
person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information. 
   (B)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter, in addition to any applicable penalty described in
Section
182.99 of this Chapter.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (A) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.10 of this Chapter.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (B)(1) and (2) of this
section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee with
respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition to
any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 of this Chapter for a violation of
182.15 of this Chapter, and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax
Administrator by law.
         (Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by ORC 718 or by the charter
or ordinance of the Municipality is confidential, and no person shall access or
disclose such information except in accordance with a proper judicial order or
in connection with the performance of that person's official duties or the
official business of the Municipality as authorized by ORC 718 or the charter
or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax Administrator of the Municipality or
a designee thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received
under this chapter and other related tax information to the Internal Revenue
Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and Tax Administrators of other municipal
corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
state law to be filed with  the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Municipality or  the Tax
Administrator.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.16  OPINION OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATOR.
   (A)    An "opinion of the Tax Administrator" means an opinion issued under
this section with respect to prospective municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (B)    A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (C), (G), and (H) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this Chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."
   (C)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator shall remain in effect and shall
protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified state law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
state law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (D)    (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
182.15 of this Chapter.
   (E)    If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section,
the opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change
for any of the reasons stated in division (C) of this section;
      (2)    It is the duty of the taxpayer to be aware of such changes.
   (F)    A Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section.
   (G)    This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (H)    An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (I)    A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (J)    An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under subsection (F) may not be appealed.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)    The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)    (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty per cent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review. 
         (Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (A)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio Revised Code
Chapter 718. 
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.
The three members of the Local Board of Tax Review may be domiciled in the
Municipality, but the appointing authority may consider membership from
individuals who are not domiciled within the Municipality. 
Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the
Municipality, and  may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with
the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years immediately
preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an employee of
the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer,
or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the board of tax review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code. 
      (5)   A member of the board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.   
   (B)    Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment,  the manner in which the taxpayer
may appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be
directed, and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)    Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the
assessment to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall
be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)    The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason, any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing.
(Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)   Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
latter of:
            (i)   Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)   One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)   The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
182.18 of this Chapter.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent
decision, finding, or holding by any administrative body or court that the
Local Board of Tax Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Local Board of Tax Review, the
sixtieth day after the date on which the final determination of the Local Board
of Tax Review is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately
reversed and no further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part,
or that reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
182.096 of this Chapter.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal.  The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
182.18 of this Chapter, of the Ohio board of tax appeals, or any court to which
the decision of the Ohio board of tax appeals has been appealed, so that the
amount due from the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than
the amount paid, there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's
assigns or legal representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as
provided by Section
182.096 of this Chapter, with interest on that amount as provided by division
(D) of this section.
   (E)   No civil action to recover municipal income tax or related penalties
or interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 2015-37.  Passed 11-16-15.)
182.20  ADOPTION OF RULES.
   (A)   Pursuant to Section 718.30 of the Revised Code, the Municipality,
pursuant to this Chapter, grants authority to the Tax Administrator to adopt
rules to administer the income tax imposed by the Municipality.
   (B)   All rules adopted under this section shall be published and posted on

   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:

the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or

to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed

   313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection. 
(ORC 4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
 313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)
   313.04  LANE-USE CONTROL SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   (a)   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
      (1)   A steady downward green arrow: A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
      (2)   A steady yellow “X”: A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane
over which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is
being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
         (ORC 4511.131)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.

   313.05  SPECIAL PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this

   313.07  UNAUTHORIZED SIGNS AND SIGNALS, HIDING FROM VIEW, ADVERTISING.
   (a)   No person shall place, maintain or display upon or in view of any
street any unauthorized sign, signal, marking or device which purports to be,
is an imitation of or resembles a traffic control device or railroad sign or
signal, or which attempts to direct the movement of traffic, or hides from view
or interferes with the effectiveness of any traffic control device or any
railroad sign or signal, and no person shall place or maintain, nor shall any
public authority permit upon any street any traffic sign or signal bearing
thereon any commercial advertising.  This section does not prohibit either the
erection upon private property adjacent to streets of signs giving useful
directional information and of a type that cannot be mistaken for traffic
control devices, or the erection upon private property of traffic control
devices by the owner of real property in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.211 and
4511.432.
   Every such prohibited sign, signal, marking or device is a public nuisance,
and the Police Chief is authorized to remove it or cause it to be removed.

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.

offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving

The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term
under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The

both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or

noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into

Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio

offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.

license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

suspension at the time of the alleged violation of subsection (a) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

Municipality if any of the following occur:
      (1)   The person commits an offense under the laws of this Municipality,
any element of which takes place in this Municipality.

offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is

commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as
described in this subsection, the person is subject to criminal prosecution and
punishment in this Municipality for the attempt, complicity, or conspiracy, and
for any resulting offense that is committed or completed in the other

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

Municipality in violation of the law of this Municipality.
   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the

section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject
under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is

network”, “information service”, “telecommunication”, “telecommunications
device”, “telecommunications service”, “data”, and “writing” have the same

(ORC 2901.11)
   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an element is
fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred. 
(ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.    (ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01. 
(ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
   "The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony subject
to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
   "It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
 
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
 
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
 
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf. 
(ORC 2901.24)
   501.13  DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE:  See Ohio R.C. 2981.01 et seq.)
   501.14  CONSPIRACY.

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evalute such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.

         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy

         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;

   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor           MaximumFine

plainly indicates a purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon
organizations, then the penalty so provided shall be imposed in lieu of the
penalty provided in this subsection (c).

the fine that is provided in this subsection (c), then the penalty imposed
shall be pursuant to the penalty provided for the violation of the section
defining the offense.
      (3)   This subsection (c) does not prevent the imposition of available
civil sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to
Section
501.11, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
subsection (c).

and evidence and the right to cross examine witnesses shall be preserved. All
testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by affirmation. The

the hearing record, if any, at such cost as the Board deems appropriate.
   (g)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence that the person complained against has

Director in executive session, state its findings to and cause requiring the
person complained against to cease and desist from such unlawful conduct and to
take such affirmative action as will effectuate the purposes of this chapter,
with notice that if the Board determines that the person complained against has
not after fifteen calendar days following service of the Board's order complied
with the order, the Board will recertify the matter to the Law Director for
enforcement.
   (h)    Upon recertification to the Law Director for enforcement, he shall
seek compliance by appropriate civil action brought in the name of the Fair
Housing Board of the City before a court of competent jurisdiction. In any such
proceeding, where the court determines that there has been a violation of this
chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages and, where appropriate,
punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court may also order such other
relief as it deems necessary and appropriate.
   (i)    If at the conclusion of the hearing the Board shall determine upon
the preponderance of the evidence of the record that the person complained
against has not violated this chapter, the Board shall state and publish its
findings and issue its order dismissing the complaint.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.

   545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of

involved in the offense.

545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,

545.08,
545.10(b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15 or
545.20 involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender’s same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05 or
545.15 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender’s same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05 that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05,
545.06 or
545.08, Section

545.15 or
545.20, whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving

may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a single

employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under

single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:

materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered

purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair

would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all

value of property or services involved in a theft offense:

wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.

value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

         (Ord. 2004-23.  Passed 4-13-04.)
   921.05  VOLUME OF WASTEWATER.
   (a)   As described in subsequent sections of this chapter, certain segments
of the sanitary sewer charges are determined by applying a unit charge to a
volume of wastewater flow from each user.  In all cases, this volume to be
charged for shall be one hundred percent (100%) of the volume that is recorded
on the meters used to measure water from the water system of the City, unless
the user is supplied with water from a source other than the water system of
the City or unless a substantial volume of water supplied to the user is not
discharged to the wastewater treatment works, in which case, the volume of
water discharged to the wastewater treatment works shall be determined by a
meter installed to measure wastewater discharged, or by other means approved by
the Director.  In the event a sewer user shall elect at his own cost and
expense to install a meter to register the exact volume of wastewater that
enters the wastewater treatment works, the volume to be charged for such
metered discharge shall be based upon one hundred percent (100%) of the actual
meter reading and the rates established by the City shall apply.  Meters
installed, other than the meter used to record consumption from the water
system of the City, require approval by the Director and must be purchased,
installed and maintained at the expense of the user.
   (b)   Wastewater meters may be tested by the Director for accuracy at the
expense of the owner once each year.
   (c)   The Director shall have the authority to remove, test and correct any
meter which is registering incorrectly or was not previously approved by the
Director without the consent of the owner.  Should the wastewater meter be
found to be registering outside of the accuracy of the specifications published
for such meter, the owner shall bear the cost for shipping, testing, repair and
replacement.  Should the wastewater meter be found to be registering within the
accuracy of the specifications published for such meter, the City shall bear
the cost for shipping, testing, repair and replacement if the meter and
installation were previously approved by the Director.  During the period the
meter is not in service, the volume of wastewater discharged for all purposes
shall be determined by the Director.
(Ord. 2004-23.  Passed 4-13-04.)
   921.06  USER CLASS.
   (a)   For the purpose of applying user charges and extra strength
surcharges, all users of the wastewater treatment works shall be classified as
a member of one of the following two user classes:
      (1)   Non-industrial; and
      (2)   Industrial.
   (b)   A user may be placed in the non-industrial user class if the industry
discharges primarily segregated sanitary wastes or primarily wastes from
sanitary conveniences.
   (c)   Any userwhose wastes are not primarily sanitary wastes or not
primarily wastes from sanitary conveniences shall be placed in the industrial
user class.
   (d)   The placement of a user within the non-industrial user class shall be
as determined by the Director in accordance with the above criteria.
(Ord. 2004-23.  Passed 4-13-04.)
   921.07  USER CHARGES; WASTES OF NORMAL CONCENTRATION.
   (a)   A user charge shall be levied on all users of the wastewater treatment
works to provide funds necessary to pay for the cost of operation and
maintenance of the treatment works to each user, or user class, in proportion
to such users contribution to the total wastewater loading of the treatment
works.  Factors such as strength, volume, nature of pollutants, and delivery
flow rate characteristics shall be considered and included as the basis for the
user’s contribution to ensure a proportional distribution of operation and
maintenance costs.  The method to be used to establish the user charges for
wastes within the limits of normal concentrations, as defined in Section
921.03, shall be as provided in this section.  The method to be used to
establish the extra strength surcharge for wastes in excess of normal
concentrations shall be as provided in Section
921.08.
   (b)   The volume of wastewater from each user shall be subject to a user
charge as follows:
      (1)   Charges for each quarterly billing during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following values:
         A.   Previous year’s annual total operation and maintenance expenses
(Cto), excluding those expenses attributable to debt service costs;
         B.   Previous years annual revenue from extra strength surcharges
(CS);
         C.   Current total water subject to sanitary sewer charges (Qt);
         D.   Current administration and associated expenses for preparation
and collection of billings (Cb).
      (2)   The user charge per 100 cubic feet shall equal the estimated total
operation and maintenance expenses (Cto) plus the estimated administration and
associated expenses for preparation and collection of billings (Cb) minus the
estimated revenue from extra strength surcharges (Cs) divided by the estimated
water consumption subject to sanitary sewer charges (Qt), in 100 cubic feet.
 
User charge = Cto + Cb - Cs   (per 100 cubic feet)
         Qt
      (3)   Each consumer unit shall be billed quarterly and shall be subject
to a minimum charge corresponding to a wastewater volume of 1000 cubic feet.
      (4)   User charges for wastewater volumes in excess of 1000 cubic feet
per quarter shall be calculated pursuant to this subsection (b)(2) hereof.
      (5)   In the event of a master water meter serving more than one
consumer, each consumer unit shall be subject to the minimum charge and be
allowed a discharge of 1,000 cubic feet per consumer unit before additional
volume charges shall apply.
   (c)   User charges levied pursuant to this section shall be billed pursuant
to Section
921.10.  Rates shall be established by the Auditor and adopted by Council. 
(Ord. 2004-23.  Passed 4-13-04.)
   921.08  EXTRA STRENGTH SURCHARGES.
   (a)   The annual adjustment is based on sewer revenue fund expenses from the
previous year and the lesser of the rated load capacity or actual load received
at the wastewater treatment plant (works) for the last twelve (12) months, for
each pollutant parameter as defined in Chapter
921.  In addition to the base user charges applicable pursuant to Section
921.07 users discharging pollutants to the wastewater treatment works of the
City, whose average concentration, as defined in Section
921.03 in one or more parameters exceeds in any month that concentration
defined as normal in Section
921.03 in the corresponding classification shall be subject to surcharges
calculated as follows:
      (1)   Surcharges for each billing period during a calendar year shall be
based upon the following values for that calendar year;
         A.   Previous years’ total operation and maintenance expenses pursuant
to Section
921.07(b)(1)(Cto);
         B.   Previous years’ total pound of CBOD received at the plant (Bt);
         C.   Previous years’ total pounds of suspended solids received at the
plant (St);
         D.   Previous years’ total pounds of phosphorus received at the plant
(Pt);
         E.   Previous years’ total pounds of ammonia received at the plant
(At); and
         F.   Previous years’ total pounds of oil and grease received at the
Plant (Ot)
         G.   Data not available shall be estimated in the most practical
manner possible
         H.   If the above parameter value exceeds the plants’ design capacity,
then design capacity will be used.
      (2)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of CBOD in excess of normal
equals:
 
Cto x 0.24
      Bt
      (3)   Surcharge on user charges per pound of suspended solids in excess
of normal equals:
 
Cto x 0.17
      St

of suspended solids is 240 milligrams per liter or less, no surcharge for
suspended solids shall apply.
      (9)   Pounds of phosphorus per billing period subject to surcharge
equals: the average concentration of phosphorus, calculated pursuant to Section
921.03, milligrams per liter minus 10 milligrams per liter, times the volumes
of wastewater discharged from the user to the wastewater treatment works per
billing period, in 100 cubic feet times 0.006238.  If the average concentration
of phosphorus is 10 milligrams per liter or less, no surcharge for phosphorus
shall apply.
      (10)   Pounds of ammonia per billing period subject to surcharge equals:
the average concentration of ammonia, calculated pursuant to Section
921.03, milligrams per liter minus 25 milligrams per liter, times the volume of

actual or threatened discharge presenting an imminent or substantial danger to
the health or welfare of persons, the sewer system, or the environment. 
Emergency suspension of sewer service and/or discharge permit may not be
appealed to the Director.  Any person notified of such suspension shall
immediately eliminate such condition or discharge.  If the person fails to
immediately comply, the Director may immediately sever the sewer connection to
prevent or minimize the danger.  If the Director has not issued a 30-day notice
of termination of sewer services and/or revocation of discharge permit and upon
proof by the discharger of the elimination of the conditions creating the
actual or threatened imminent or substantial danger, the Director may reinstate
the sewer service and/or discharge permit at the discharger’s own expense.
   (g)   Administrative Fines.

incurred by the city to clear the obstruction, repair the damage, and any other
expenses or damages incurred by the city.  Assessments made by the Director
against a user may be added to the user’s sewer service charge and the Director
shall have such collection remedies as he is to collect other service charges.
   (i)   Recovery of Penalties against the City.  If the city pays a penalty
for a violation of the city’s NPDES permit or violation of water quality
standards or otherwise as the result of any spill or slug discharge, then the

   924.01  PURPOSE AND POLICY.
   (a)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for industrial discharges
into the Delphos wastewater collection and treatment system and enables the
City to protect health in conformity with all applicable local, State and
Federal laws relating thereto. 
   The objectives of this chapter are:
      (1)    To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater
system which will interfere with the normal operation of the system or
contaminate the resulting municipal sludge;
      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the City wastewater
system which do not receive adequate treatment in the POTW, and which will pass
through the system into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be
incompatible with the system;
      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim wastewater and
sludge from the system.
   (b)   This chapter provides for the regulation of discharges into the
Delphos wastewater system through the enforcement of administrative regulations
and permits.  This chapter does not provide for the recovery operations,
maintenance or replacement costs of the POTW or the costs associated with the
construction of collection and treatment systems used by industrial
dischargers, in proportion to their use of the POTW, which are the subject of
separate enactments. 
(Ord. 2008-55.  Passed 10-14-08.)

Requirements.  A discharger may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation.  These bypasses are
not subject to the provisions of subsection (e) and (f) hereof.
   (e)   Prohibition of Bypass.
      (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Director may take enforcement action
against a discharger for a bypass, unless:
         A.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury
or severe property damage;
         B.   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the
use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or
maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This condition is not
satisfied if adequate back up equipment should have been installed in the
exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass which occurred
during normal periods of equipment downtime or preventative maintenance; and
         C.   The discharger submitted notices as required under subsection (f)
hereof.
      (2)   The Director may approve an anticipated bypass, after considering
its adverse effects, if the Director determines that it will meet the three
conditions listed in subsection (e)(1) hereof.
   (f)   Notice.
      (1)   If a discharger knows in advance of the need for bypass, it shall
submit prior notice to the Director, if possible at least ten days before the
date of the bypass.
      (2)   A discharger shall submit oral notice of an unanticipated bypass
that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards to the Director within twenty
four hours from the time the discharger becomes aware of the bypass.  A written
submission shall also be provided within five days of the time the discharger
becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall contain a
description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including
exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the
anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken or planned to
reduce, eliminate and prevent recurrence of the bypass.  The Director may waive
the written report on a case by case basis if the oral report has been received
within twenty four hours.

contributions of pollutants for all dischargers at any time.
      (4)   Standards modification.  The City reserves the right to amend this
chapter and the terms and conditions thereof in order to assure compliance by
the City with applicable laws and regulations.  Within a reasonable time after
the promulgation of a National Categorical Pretreatment Standard, this chapter
and/or the wastewater discharge permit subject to such standards shall be
amended to require compliance by dischargers with such standards within the
time frame prescribed by such standards.  All National Categorical Pretreatment
Standards adopted after the promulgation of this chapter shall be adopted by
the City as part of this chapter.  Where a discharger subject to a National
Categorical Pretreatment Standard has not previously submitted a baseline
report as required by subsection (b)(2) hereof, and/or an application as
required by subsection (b)(3) hereof, the discharger shall file a baseline
report and/or apply for a wastewater discharge permit with the Director within
180 days after the promulgation of the applicable National Categorical
Pretreatment Standards by the U.S. EPA.  In addition, any discharger operating
on the basis of a previous filing of a baseline report and/or wastewater
discharge permit shall submit to the City within 180 days after the
promulgation of an applicable National Categorical Pretreatment Standard the
additional information required by paragraphs H. and I. of subsection (b)(2)
hereof.  The discharger shall be informed of any proposed changes in this
chapter at least thirty days prior to the effective date of change.  Any
changes or new conditions in this chapter shall include a reasonable time
schedule for compliance.

         K.   Applicable civil and criminal penalties for violations;
         L.   Any applicable monitoring waiver; and
         M.   Other conditions as deemed appropriate by the Director to ensure
compliance with this chapter including conditions for transfer.
      (6)   Permit duration.  Permits shall be issued for a specified time
period, not to exceed five years.  A permit may be issued for a period less
than one year or may be stated to expire on a specific date.  The industrial
discharger shall apply for permit reissuance a minimum of 180 days prior to the
expiration of the industrial discharger's existing permit.  The terms and
conditions of the permit as limitations or requirements as identified in
Section
924.03 are modified or other just cause exists.  The industrial discharger
shall be informed of any proposed changes in its permit at least thirty days
prior to the effective date of change.  Any changes or new conditions in the
permit shall include a reasonable time schedule for compliance.
      (7)   Permit transfer.  Wastewater discharge permits are issued to a
specific industrial discharger for a specific operation.  A wastewater
discharge permit shall not be reassigned or transferred or sold to a new owner,
new industrial discharger, different premises or a new or changed operation
without the approval of the City.  Any succeeding owner or industrial
discharger shall also comply with the terms and conditions of the existing
permit.
   (c)   Compliance Reports.
      (1)   Initial compliance report.
         A.   Within ninety days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
discharger subject to pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Director a report containing information as indicated in subsection (b)
(2)C. through F. and L. hereof, inclusive.  The report shall state whether the
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements are being met on a consistent
basis and shall include documentation indicating compliance with BMPs.  If not
in compliance, the discharger shall submit a description of what additional
operation and maintenance and/or pretreatment is necessary to bring the
discharger into compliance with the applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements.  New sources shall install and have in operating condition, and
shall start up all pollution control equipment and BMPs required to meet
applicable pretreatment standards before beginning to discharge.  Within the
shortest feasible time (not to exceed ninety days), new sources must meet all
applicable pretreatment standards.
         B.   For dischargers subject to equivalent mass or concentration
limits established by the Director in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR
403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the discharger's
long term production rate.  For all other dischargers subject to categorical
pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per
unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include
the discharger's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. 
This report shall be signed by an authorized representative of the discharger.
      (2)   Periodic compliance report.
         A.   Any discharger subject to a pretreatment standard set forth in
this chapter, after the compliance date of such pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new discharger, after commencement of the discharge to the City,
shall submit to the Director during the months of June and December, unless
required more frequently by the Director, a report indicating the nature and
concentration of prohibited or regulated substances in the effluent which are
limited by the pretreatment standards hereof and documentation of compliance
with BMPs.  In addition, this report shall include a record of all measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows during the reporting period.  Flows
shall be reported on the basis of actual measurement, provided however, where
cost or feasibility considerations justify, the Director may accept reports of
average and maximum flows estimated by verifiable techniques.  The City, for
good cause shown considering such factors as local high or low flow rates,
holidays, budget cycles or other extenuating factors, may authorize the
submission of such reports on months other than those specified above.  Reports
from dischargers must be signed by an authorized representative of the
discharger.  All sampling results obtained by the discharger shall be reported
to the Director including any sampling performed more frequently than
required.  Dischargers shall notify the Director in writing within twenty four
hours if any sampling results violate applicable pretreatment standards.  The
discharger shall repeat the sampling and analysis for those parameters in
violation and resubmit the results within thirty days of becoming aware of the
violation. Where the City performs sampling and analysis and a violation is
indicated, the City shall repeat sampling and analysis within 30 days.
         B.   Reports of all industrial dischargers shall contain all results
of sampling and analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature
and concentration, or production and mass where required by the City.  The
minimum frequency of monitoring by the discharger shall be as prescribed in the
applicable pretreatment standard of this chapter.  All analyses shall be
performed in accordance with 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto.  Where 40
CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling or analytical technique for the
pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance
with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis
Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants,
April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical
procedures approved by the Administrator of the U.S. EPA.
   (d)   Monitoring Facilities.
      (1)   Each discharger shall provide and operate at the discharger's own
expense, a monitoring facility to allow inspection, and provide sampling and
flow measurement of each sewer discharge to the City.  Each monitoring facility
shall be situated on the discharger's premises, except where such a location
would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the discharger, the City may
concur with the facility being constructed in the public street or sidewalk
area providing that the facility is located so that it will not be obstructed
by landscaping or parked vehicles.
      (2)   There should be ample room in or near such sampling facility to
allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis.  The facility,
sampling and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition at the expense of the discharger.
      (3)   All monitoring facilities shall be constructed and maintained in
accordance with all applicable local construction standards and
specifications.  New dischargers shall complete construction prior to
commencement of discharge.
   (e)   Inspection and Sampling.
      (1)   The City may inspect the monitoring facilities of any discharger to
determine compliance with the requirements of this chapter.  The discharger
shall allow the Director or his representatives to enter upon the premises of
the discharger at all reasonable hours, for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examining and/or copying records.  The City shall have the right to
set up on the discharger's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations.
      (2)   Where a discharger has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into their premises,
the discharger shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the City
will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their
specific responsibilities.
      (3)   All SIU sampling required by this subsection shall be conducted as
follows:
         A.   Except as indicated in paragraphs B. and C. below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using 24 hour flow-proportional composite sampling
techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is
authorized by the Director upon justification maintained in the user's file. 
Where time proportional composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by
the Director, the samples must be representative of the discharge.  Using
protocols "including appropriate preservation" specified in 40 CFR part 136 and
appropriate EPA guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour
period may be composite prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total
phenols, and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the
field; for volatile organics and oil and grease, the samples may be composited
in the laboratory.  Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved EPA methodologies may be
authorized by the Director as appropriate.  In addition, grab samples may be
required to show compliance with instantaneous limits.
         B.   Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, total
phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab
collection techniques.
         C.   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
initial compliance reports required in subsections (b)(2) and (c)(1) hereof, a
minimum of four or grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols,
oil and grease, sulfide and volatile organic compounds for facilities for which
historical sampling data do not exist; for facilities for which historical
sampling data are available, the Director may authorize a lower minimum. Unless
an alternate sampling procedure is specified by the Director, where the flow of
the stream being sampled is less than or equal to 250,000 gallons per day, the
user shall take three samples within a two-week period; where the flow of the
stream being sampled is greater than 250,000 gallons per day, the user shall
take six samples within a two-week period.  For the periodic compliance reports
required by subsection (c)(2) hereof the industrial user is required to collect
the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance with
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
         D.   Samples should be taken immediately downstream from pretreatment
facilities, if such exists, or immediately downstream from the regulated
process if no pretreatment exists.
   (f)   Pretreatment.
      (1)   Industrial dischargers shall provide necessary wastewater treatment
as required to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with all
Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards within the time limitations as
specified by the Federal Pretreatment Regulations.  Any facilities required to
pretreat wastewater to a level acceptable to the City shall be provided,
operated and maintained at the discharger's expense.
      (2)   Detailed plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating
procedures shall be submitted to the Director for review, and shall be
acceptable to the Director and approved in writing before construction of the
facility.  The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the discharger from the responsibility of modifying the facility as
necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the Director under the
provisions of this chapter.  Any subsequent changes in the pretreatment
facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be acceptable to the
Director and approved in writing prior to the discharger's initiation of the
changes.
   (g)   Confidential Information.
      (1)   Information and dates furnished to the City with respect to the
nature and frequency of discharge shall be available to the public or other
governmental agency without restriction unless the discharger specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the City that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods of
production entitled to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information
of the discharger.
      (2)   When requested by a discharger furnishing a report, the portions of
a report which may disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made
available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon written
request to governmental agencies for uses related to this chapter, the NPDES
permit, State disposal system permit and/or the pretreatment programs;
provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use by
the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings
involving the discharger furnishing the report.  Wastewater constituents and
characteristics will not be recognized as confidential information.
      (3)   Information accepted by the Director as confidential shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the Director
until and unless a ten day notification is given to the discharger.
   (h)   Reporting Requirements for City.  The City will forward pertinent
information regarding changes in the National Pretreatment Categorical
Standards to industries affected if the information received by the City from
EPA does not indicate that industry has already been informed by EPA.
   (i)   Notification of Changed Discharge.  All dischargers shall promptly
notify the Director at least 30 days prior to any substantial change (greater
than 10 percent) in the volume or character of pollutants in their discharge,
including the listed or characteristic hazardous wastes for which the
industrial user has submitted initial notification under 40 CFR 403.12(p).
(Ord. 2008-55.  Passed 10-14-08.)
   924.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   The Director may act under any one or more of the following subsections to
administer and enforce the provisions of Chapters
921,
923 and
924 and any orders issued by the Director or by a court relating to wastewater.
   (a)   Orders.  The Director may issue orders to any person as the Director
deems necessary to administer and enforce the provisions of Chapters
921,
923 and
924.  Director's orders shall be served upon the affected person either in
person or by certified mail.  Any person issued an order, other than a consent
order, by the Director may appeal the order under Section
924.07.  The Director may, but need not, issue a notice of violation or hold a
show cause hearing with respect to an order.  The Director may issue, but is
not limited to, the following types of orders:
      (1)   Consent orders.  The Director may enter into consent orders
establishing an agreement with any person responsible for noncompliance.  The
order would include specific action to be taken by the person to correct the
noncompliance within a specified period of time.  This order may include
provisions for payment of administrative fines assessed under Section
924.06(g).
      (2)   Compliance orders.  Upon finding that a person has violated this
chapter, the Director may issue an order directing that, after a specified time
period, sewer service shall be discontinued unless adequate treatment
facilities have been installed and are properly operated.  The order may also
include requirements for additional self-monitoring and management practices.
      (3)   Cease and desist orders.  Upon finding that a person has violated
Chapters
921,
923, or
924, the Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations
and direct appropriate remedial or preventative action to permanently prevent
such violation including halting operations and terminating discharge.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  Whenever the Director finds that any person has
violated this chapter, the Director may serve upon such person a written notice
of violation (NOV).  Within 30 days of service, such person shall submit to the
Director a written explanation of the violation and remedial action plan to
correct the violation and prevent future occurrence.  This does not relieve the
person of liability for any violations.  A discharger may not appeal a NOV.
   (c)    Show Cause Hearing.  The Director may order any person who causes or
contributes to violations of this chapter to show cause why a proposed
enforcement action should not be taken.  The person shall be served a notice of
the hearing, specifying the place and time of the hearing, the proposed
enforcement action, and the reasons for such action and a request that the
person show cause why this proposed enforcement action should not be taken. 
The notice of hearing shall be served on the discharger, personally or by
certified mail, at least 10 days prior to the hearing.  Service may be made on
any agent, officer or authorized representative of the discharger or to the
discharger's principal place of business or to the facility at which the
noncompliance occurred.  The Director may take evidence and may tape record or
stenographically record the proceedings.  If a recording is made, it shall be
available to the party and the public at a cost.  If the person fails to
appear, the person shall be deemed to agree with the action proposed by the
Director.
   (d)   Actions taken by the Director resulting from a show cause hearing are
not subject to the appeal provisions set forth in Section
924.07.  Failure to hold a show cause hearing or defects in the hearing do not
affect the validity of any enforcement action taken.
   (e)   Termination of Treatment Services and/or Revocation of Discharge
Permit.  After 30 days notice, except as provided in Section
924.06(e), the Director may terminate sewer services and/or revoke the
discharge permit of any person who violates any provision or condition of this
chapter, including but not limited to the following:
      (1)   Failure to factually report wastewater constituents and
characteristics including strength of its discharge; or
      (2)   Failure to report significant changes in wastewater constituents or
characteristics including strength of its discharge; or
      (3)   Failure to permit reasonable access to the discharger's premises by
representatives of the Director for purpose of inspection or monitoring; or
      (4)   Failure to conform to the requirements of the discharge permit; or
      (5)   Failure to conform to any judicial order relating to wastewater;
      (6)   Failure to conform to the provisions of Chapters
921,
923 and/or
924 that cause pass through or interference with the wastewater treatment
plant.
The Director may take any action necessary to prevent use of the sewer system
by persons whose sewer services have been terminated including severing the
sewer connection and terminating city water service.
   (f)   Emergency Suspension of Sewer Services and/or Discharge Permit.  The
Director may immediately suspend sewer services and/or discharge permit of any
person whenever, in the Director's opinion, such action is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge presenting an imminent or substantial danger to
the health or welfare of persons, the sewer system, or the environment. 
Emergency suspension of sewer service and/or discharge permit may not be
appealed to the Director.  Any person notified of such suspension shall
immediately eliminate such condition or discharge.  If the person fails to
immediately comply, the Director may immediately sever the sewer connection to
prevent or minimize the danger.  If the Director has not issued a 30-day notice
of termination of sewer services and/or revocation of discharge permit and upon
proof by the discharger of the elimination of the conditions creating the
actual or threatened imminent or substantial danger, the Director may reinstate
the sewer service and/or discharge permit at the discharger's own expense.
   (g)   Administrative Fines.
      (1)   The Director may assess, on a strict liability basis,
administrative fines not to exceed $500.00 per violation against any person who
violates any provision of this chapter, discharge permit, or order under this
chapter.  Each day, or portion thereof, when a violation occurs, shall be
considered a separate violation.
      (2)   In determining the amount of an administrative fine, the Director
shall consider the magnitude and severity of the violation, history of past
violations or compliance, economic advantage accrued by the violator due to the
violation or noncompliance, and affirmative actions taken by the violator to
comply with the provisions of this chapter and regulations, permit or order. 
The Director may establish minimum administrative fines for violation of
specific sections of the chapter, discharge permits, or orders.
      (3)   Administrative fines assessed by the Director against a person may
be added to the person's sewer service charge and the Director shall have such
collection remedies as provided to collect other service charges.
      (4)   Any person assessed an administrative fine under this paragraph may
appeal the action as provided in Section
924.07.  Any person assessed an administrative fine and believing that an
affirmative defense provided by this chapter applies shall raise the defense
through such appeal.
   (h)   Recovery of Costs. Any person who discharges or causes a discharge
producing an obstruction, damage, or any other impairment to the wastewater
treatment works or the wastewater treatment plant, or any related expense of
whatever character or nature to the City, the Director may assess the expenses
incurred by the City to clear the obstruction, repair the damage, and any other
expenses or damages incurred by the City.  Assessments made by the Director
against a user may be added to the user's sewer service charge and the Director
shall have such collection remedies as he has to collect other service charges.
   (i)   Recovery of Penalties Against The City.  If the City pays a penalty
for a violation of the City's NPDES permit or violation of water quality
standards or otherwise as the result of any spill or slug discharge, then the
penalty, including all City legal, sampling, analytical testing costs, and any
other related costs may be charged to the responsible person.  This charge is
in addition to other remedies available to the City.
   (j)   Judicial Proceedings.  Upon authorization of funds by Council:
      (1)   Whenever the Director finds that any person has violated the
provisions of this chapter, the Director may seek from a court of competent
jurisdiction injunctive relief against such person.
      (2)   The Director may seek in a civil action collection of any
administrative fines and seek civil penalties and damages provided by this
chapter.
      (3)   The Director may refer any violation of this chapter to the City
Attorney for criminal prosecution.

   1111.01  GENERAL STATEMENT.
   (a)   The regulations in Sections
1111.02 to
1111.17 inclusive, shall control the manner in which street, lots and other
elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land.  These design controls
shall help insure convenient and safe streets, creation of usable lots,
provision of space for public utilities and reservation of land for
recreational uses.  The planning of attractive and functional neighborhoods
shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features of unplanned, haphazard
growth.
   (b)   The Planning Commission has the responsibility for review of the
design of each future subdivision early in its design development.  The
Planning Commission shall ensure that all of the requirements of Sections
1111.02 to
1111.17 inclusive, are met.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.02  CONFORMITY TO DEVELOPMENT PLANS AND ZONING.
   The arrangement, character, width and location of all arterial and collector
thoroughfares or extensions thereof shall conform with the Major Thoroughfare
Plan of the Planning Commission Thoroughfares not contained in the
aforementioned plan shall conform to the recommendation of the Planning
Commission based upon the design standards set forth in Sections
1111.02 to
1111.11, inclusive.  In addition, no final plat of land within the area in
which an existing zoning ordinance (resolution) is in effect should be approved
unless it conforms with the Zoning Ordinance. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.03  SUITABILITY OF LAND.
   If the Planning Commission finds that the land proposed to be subdivided is
unsuitable for subdivision development due to conditions which may endanger
health, life, or property as determined by investigations conducted by the
public agencies concerned; then it is determined that in the best interests of
the public the land should not be developed for the purpose proposed.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.04  STREET DESIGN.
   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade construction and location
of all streets shall conform to the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the Planning
Commission or subsequent amendments thereto, and shall be considered in their
relationship to existing and planned streets, topographical conditions, and
public convenience and safety and in their appropriate relation to the proposed
uses of the land to be served by such streets.  The street pattern shall
discourage through traffic in the interior of the subdivision, except on
collector or subcollector streets designed to convey traffic to the exterior of
the subdivision.  The subdivider shall provide within the boundaries of the
subdivision plat, the necessary right-of-way for the widening, continuance or
alignment of such streets in conformity with the Major Thoroughfare Plan of the
Planning Commission.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.05  STREET DESIGN STANDARDS.
   The design and improvement standards contained in
TABLE 1 are suggested as minimum design standards.  All streets shall be
designed and constructed in accordance with the standards specified in
TABLE 1 and
Appendix A and
B. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.06  HORIZONTAL ALIGNMENT.
   When there is an angle of deflection of more than five degrees (5°) between
two (2) center line tangent sections of a street, a curve of adequate radius
shall connect them (See
TABLE 1).  A minimum tangent between reverse curves should be fifty (50) feet
for collector streets.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.07  VERTICAL ALIGNMENT.
   (a)   All changes of grade shall be connected by vertical curves of minimum
length in feet equal to twenty (20) times the algebraic difference in the rate
of grade for arterials and industrial streets; for collector and local streets,
fifteen (15) times.  The minimum length of vertical curves shall be fifty (50)
feet.  See
TABLE 1 for maximum grade change without vertical curves.
   (b)   Minimum vertical visibility shall conform to
TABLE 1 of these Regulations and the Ohio Department of Transportation’s
regulations in effect on the date of approval of the preliminary plan.
   (c)   No street grade shall be less than one-half percent (0.5%), except at
sag and crest points of vertical curves, and in no case shall a street grade be
more than three percent (3%) within one hundred (100) feet of an intersection. 

(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.08  INTERSECTION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   The design and improvement standards for intersections are suggested
minimum standards for all street intersections in the subdivision.  These
standards are included in the Street Design Standards,
TABLE 1.  Streets shall remain tangent for at least one hundred (100) feet
beyond the point of intersection for collector streets and fifty (50) feet for
local streets.  The angle of intersection shall be between seventy-five degrees
(75°) and ninety degrees (90°), with a ninety degree (90°) intersection
preferred.
   (b)   Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than two (2)
streets shall not be permitted. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.09  STREET CLASSIFICATION SYSTEM.
   For the purposes of administration, design and enforcement these regulations
recognize the hierarchical classification of area roadways within the Federal
Functional Classification System recommended and approved by the Lima-Allen
County Regional Planning Commission, the Ohio Department of Transportation
(ODOT) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).  The functional
classification of area roadways has been somewhat abbreviated herein with
specific distinctions within the higher order roadways collapsed.  These
regulations recognize arterial and collector roadways as higher order roadways
eligible for federal funding.  Those roadways classified as local roadways are,
by default, those roadways which have not been identified as eligible for
federal funding.
   (a)   Arterial.  Arterials are major thoroughfares designed to carry traffic
between municipalities and other activity centers and to provide connections
with major state and interstate roadways.  No on-street parking shall be
permitted.  Arterials are identified in the areas Comprehensive Transportation
Plan and recognized by ODOT and FHWA as roadways eligible for federal funding.
   (b)   Collector.  Collectors distribute traffic between lower order local
roadways and higher order arterials.  Their purpose is primarily to promote
free traffic flow, and direct access for adjoining lots should be limited where
possible.  Collectors shall not be used for on-street parking, and may provide
linkages to adjoining developments to improve circulation.  Collectors are
identified in the area’s Comprehensive Transportation Plan and recognized by
ODOT and FHWA as roadways eligible for federal funding.
   (c)   Local Roadway.  Local Roadways provide access to residential, open
space, commercial, industrial, or other abutting property.  Local roadways
include subcollector streets, residential streets, and cul-de-sac streets. 
Other local roadways are classified as special street types and are addressed
in Section
1111.10 of these regulations.
      (1)   Subcollector - Subcollectors are local streets designed to provide
access to adjoining property and carry traffic between local residential
streets or cl-de-sacs and higher order collectors and arterials.  Subcollectors
shall be provided when residential subdivisions exceed 100 single family
dwellings, or the subdivision has only one entrance from a collector or
arterial street.
      (2)   Residential- Residential streets have a length of 1,000 feet or
less, connect to only two (2) other streets and are the lowest order streets
providing access to residential lots and carrying only the traffic generated by
adjoining residential land uses.  Residential subdivisions should be developed
so that the maximum number of housing units have frontage on local residential
and cul-de-sac streets rather than on high order roads.
      (3)   Cul-de-sac - A local street that has a single means of access and
that terminates in a circular vehicular turnaround.  Cul-de-sacs should be
encouraged where feasible to the extent that they provide low traffic volumes
and neighborhood identity.  Lengths of cul-de-sacs are limited to 600 feet.  An
Overall Development Plan containing more than three (3) cul-de-sac streets and
no through streets may be disapproved by the Planning Commission. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.10  SPECIAL STREET TYPES.
   The following requirements shall apply to special street types:
   (a)   Dead-end Street - A street having only one (1) inlet/outlet for
vehicular traffic.  Permanent Dead-end Streets shall not be permitted except as
cul-de-sacs.  Temporary Dead-end Streets shall be permitted only as part of an
approved overall development plan.  In such cases, a temporary turn-around
shall be constructed off the end of the dedicated street.  Said turnaround
shall have a design approved by the City Engineer and shall be maintained by
the developer.  A Temporary Turnaround Easement, labeled “privately
maintained”, shall be shown on the final plat.  When street construction
resumes, the developer shall remove the turnaround at his expense.  Temporary
dead-end streets shall not be permitted if they end within 300 feet from an
existing pavement.  Turnarounds will not be required on stub streets.
   (b)   Dedication of new half-streets shall not be permitted.  Where a
dedicated or platted half-street exists adjacent to the tract being subdivided,
the other half shall be platted.
   (c)   Where a subdivision fronts on an arterial roadway recognized within
the Federal Function Classification System a Marginal Access Street must be
provided.  Points of access to the arterial street shall be spaced at a minimum
of thirteen hundred twenty (1,320) feet.  A planting strip, having a minimum
width of twenty (20) feet, shall be provided between the pavement of the
arterial street and the pavement of the marginal access street.  The minimum
width of the marginal access right-of-way shall be fifty (50) feet.
   (d)   Alley - A public right-of-way primarily for secondary access by
vehicles to the rear or side of a property abutting on another street.  Alleys
shall not be approved in residential subdivisions, except where justified by
extreme conditions.  Alleys may be required in commercial and industrial
districts if other provisions cannot be made for adequate service access.  The
minimum width for alleys shall be twenty (20) feet for the right-of-way and
eighteen (18) feet for the pavement width.
      (Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.11  STREETS FOR COMMERCIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Streets serving business developments and accessory parking areas shall be
planned to connect with higher order streets so as not to generate traffic on
local residential streets.  The intersections of driveways from parking areas
with arterial or collector streets shall be located so as to cause the least
possible interference with traffic movement on the streets, and shall not be
located in less than two hundred (200) feet from the intersection of an
arterial or collector street with any other street, and shall be spaced not
less than two hundred (200) feet from each other.  The Planning Commission may
require marginal access streets to provide maximum safety and convenience.  The
developer may be required to separate ingress and egress drives on the
requirements of the Planning Commission. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.12  STREETS FOR INDUSTRIAL SUBDIVISIONS.
   Collector streets for industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve
industrial areas exclusively and shall connect with higher order streets so
that no traffic generated by the industrial subdivision will be directed into
any local residential street.  The intersections of service streets from
parking areas with arterial or collector streets shall not be less than two
hundred (200) feet from the intersection of the arterial or collector street
with any other street.  Streets shall be planned to be extended to the
boundaries of any adjoining land for industry, except for severe physical
conditions or if the Planning Commission or other appropriate local agency
finds such extension is not in accord with the approved plan for the area.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.13  SIDEWALKS REQUIRED.
   Any and all new residential, business or industrial construction project
will be required to have sidewalks constructed on the front of any such
property or on any sides of such property which abut an existing street.  A
parking area will not qualify as a sidewalk for pedestrian use.
(Ord. 2004-41.  Passed 6-22-04.)
   1111.14  BLOCKS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of blocks:
   (a)   The arrangement of blocks shall be such as to conform to the street
planning criteria as set forth in Section
1111.04 to
1111.14, inclusive, and shall be arranged to accommodate lots and building
sites of the size and character required for the district as set forth in these
regulations or the zoning ordinance  and to provide for the required community
facilities.
   (b)   Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sac or loop
streets, and those containing interior parks or playgrounds, may be approved by
the Planning Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance
of interior public spaces is covered by agreement.
   (c)   No blocks shall be longer than one thousand (1,000) feet and the block
width shall accommodate two (2) tiers or lots, except where unusual topography
or other exceptional physical circumstances exist. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.15  LOTS.
   The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of lots.
   (a)   The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites, properly related to topography and the
character of surrounding development.
   (b)   All lots shall conform to or exceed the requirements of these
Regulations and the zoning district requirements for the district in which they
are located and the use for which they are intended.
   (c)   Each lot shall have a minimum sixty (60) feet frontage at the street
right-of-way line, except for cul-de-sac lots.
   (d)   All side lot lines should be as near as possible to right angles to
street lines and radial to curved street lines.
   (e)   Through lots shall be avoided.
   (f)   All lots shall have driveway access restricted to those interior
streets platted as part of the proposed subdivision.
   (g)   No corner lot shall have a width at the building line less than
seventy-five (75) feet.  The minimum building setback on the side street side
of a corner lot shall be fifteen (15) feet.  When such corner lot abuts an
interior lot which faces the same side street at such corner lot, the minimum
building set back shall be thirty (30) feet.
   (h)   No lot shall have an average depth which is more than three times its
average width, nor shall it have a depth of less than one hundred ten (110)
feet except that whenever a lot fronts upon an exterior curved portion of a
street, the centerline radius of which is one hundred (100) feet or less, then
the minimum required lot depth may be reduced to not less than one hundred
(100) feet.
      (Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.16  EASEMENTS.
   Easements at least twenty (20) feet in width centered along the rear or side
lot lines shall be provided where necessary for sanitary and storm sewers, as
well as public utilities such as gas mains and electric lines.  Twenty (20)
foot easements shall be provided along every water course, sewer, drainage
channel, or stream within a subdivision as provided for in Section
1111.17 of these Regulations. 
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.17  FLOOD AREAS AND STORM DRAIN DITCHES.
   (a)   In order to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the
people, the Planning Commission shall reject any proposed subdivision located
within any flood hazard area as designate by but not limited to the most recent
edition of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development Federal
Insurance Administration Flood Hazard Boundary Map of Allen County, Van Wert
County and/or City of Delphos.
   (b)   Flood control or storm drainage facilities shall be provided as
follows:
      (1)   Access to flood control or storm drainage ditches and channels
shall be by means of maintenance easements.  Such maintenance easements shall
be not less than twenty (20) feet in width, measured horizontally from the top
of the bank, exclusive of the width of the ditch, or channel, and a maintenance
easement of this type shall be provided on each side of a flood control or
storm drainage ditch, channel or similar type facility.  Maintenance easements
are to be kept free of obstructions and plantings and shall not be altered from
the contour and grade shown on the approved construction plan without written
permission of the Planning Commission.
      (2)   Flood control or storm drainage easements containing underground
facilities shall have a minimum width of twenty (20) feet.
         (Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1111.18  MINIMUM BOUNDARY SURVEY REQUIREMENTS.
   The minimum boundary survey requirements for subdivision boundaries shown on
the final plat and dedicator’s plat shall be as required by the Standards

will be on area-by-area basis with each lot sized according to the average
topographic change falling within each area.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1115.03  MINIMUM LOT REQUIREMENTS FOR SINGLE FAMILY HOMES.
   The minimum lot requirements (See
Table 2) shall be used to determine the minimum lot area for a single family
home.  The average percent of slope is determined by the appropriate planning
agency.  The lot area in thousands of square feet shall then be determined by
charting the average natural ground slope and the minimum lot area.  Rounding
shall be made to the nearest five (5) foot frontage interval.  Deviations from

vertical rise of one (1) foot for each three (3) feet of horizontal distance
between abutting lots, unless a wall of sufficient height and thickness is
provided to retain the graded bank.  Major cuts, excavation, grading, and
filling, where the same materially changes the site and its relationship with
the surrounding areas or materially affects such areas, shall not be permitted
if such excavation, grading, and filling will result in a slope exceeding a
vertical rise of one (1) foot for each three (3) feet of horizontal distance
between abutting lots or between adjoining tracts of land, except where
adequate provision is made to prevent slides and erosion by cribbing and
retaining walls.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1115.06  COMPACTION OF FILL.

after the construction of the subdivision) is recommended.
APPENDIX B
STORM DRAINAGE CRITERIA
1.    PLANNING NEW STORM DRAINAGE FACILITIES
   A.    The current list of standards to be used in the design of storm
drainage is an follows:
      1.    Construction & Material Specifications by State of Ohio Department
of Transportation (latest edition);
      2.    Construction Standards of Allen County; and,
      3.    Allen County Water Management and Sediment Control Regulations.
   B.    Preparation and approval of plans and specifications:
      1.    Plans and specifications must be prepared by an Ohio Registered
Professional Engineer with adherence to the current standards;
      2.    Plans must be submitted for approval to the City Engineer.  If
unusual conditions exist, actual requirements should be predetermined by a
preliminary review with the City Engineer; and,
      3.    Plans must be submitted for approval by the administrator of the
Allen County Water Management and Sediment Control Regulations.
Layout Planning
   When planning a new subdivision, various drainage concepts should be
evaluated before decisions are made as to site grading, street location,
alignments, and block layout.  Plans should be based upon incorporating natural
waterways, artificial channels, storm sewers, and other drainage works into the
development.
   As a part of any Overall Development Plan, a fundamental study of the
drainage pattern of areas contiguous to the development must be made. 
Tributary flows having a direct effect on the storm sewerage of the proposed
subdivision shall be determined and included in the design capacities for storm
conduits within the development.  A map showing the drainage patterns of the
surrounding basin shall be submitted with the Overall Development Plan.  A
U.S.G.S. topographical map may be sufficient for this presentation.
   Planning the alignment of a storm sewer system should be done in connection
with the street layout and grading plan.  The location of catch basins,
manholes, storm sewer conduits, and drainage channels shall be approved by the
City Engineer.  Provisions must be made to accommodate runoff from upstream
areas without diversion onto neighboring properties.
System Sizing
   All new storm sewer systems must be adequate to convey anticipated runoff of
a watershed from a ten (10) year frequency storm at just full flow.  Pressure
flows for ten (10) year design storms shall be avoided.  The existing outlet
must be adequate to accept the additional runoff from the proposed subdivision
without overloading.  If the existing outlet is inadequate for such additional
flow, an improved outlet or some time-release method of discharge (detention),
satisfactory to the City Engineer, must be provided.  Detention of storm water
runoff may also be required by the Allen County Water Management and Sediment
Regulations.
   Pipe sizes will be determined from a hydrologic analysis using either the
Rational Method or the method spelled out in the publication U.S.G.S.
Techniques for Estimating Flood-Peak Discharges of Rural, Unregulated Streams
in Ohio (WRI Rep 89-4126), published jointly by the U.S. Geological Survey and
the Ohio Department of Transportation.  (Available through ODOT Location and
Design Hydraulic Section, 25 South Front Street, Columbus, Ohio, 43215).
Easements
   Where easements will be required for drainage channels or storm sewers, they
shall be labeled as such on the final plat and design calculations shall be
submitted to conform to Section
1111.15 and Section
1111.16 of the Subdivision Design Standards and be approved by the Planning
Commission.
II.    RUNOFF ANALYSIS
Methods for Estimating Runoff
   The total watershed that produces stormwater runoff across the site being
developed, shall be included when estimating flood discharge runoff.  Dependent
on watershed size, three principle methods shall be used to estimate design
discharge.
   1.    For small watersheds of 25 acres or less, the design runoff shall be
determined by the Rational Method.  This method is also used for catch basin
hydrology.
   2.    For watersheds larger than 25 acres draining rural undeveloped land
with no significant impervious areas and no existing storm sewers, the design
runoff shall be estimated by using the method published in the U.S.G.S.
Techniques for Estimating Flood-Peak Discharges of Rural, Unregulated Streams
in Ohio (WRI Rep. 89-4126) (computer program available), a replacement of the
ODNR Bulletin 45 method.
   3.    For watersheds larger than 25 acres draining developed land with
significant impervious areas (parking lots, roofs), or having existing storm
sewers, the design runoff shall be estimated by one of the following:
      a.    U.S.G.S. Estimation of Peak-Frequency Relations, Flood Hydrographs,
and Volume-Duration-Frequency Relations of Ungaged Small Urben Streams in Ohio
(Rep. 93-135)
      b.    A method approved by the City Engineer.
The Rational Method
   The Rational Method for estimating peak runoff utilizes the Rational
Formula, Q= C I A, where:
      Q =   peak runoff rate in cubic feet per second;
      C =   runoff coefficient corresponding to surface imperviousness;
      I =    rainfall intensity in inches per hour corresponding to the storm
design frequency and time of concentration,
      A =   area of the watershed tributary to the point under design in acres.
Coefficient of Imperviousness
   The following table lists runoff coefficients to be used in the Rational
Formula.  The selected factor shall reflect the anticipated land use according
to the Planning Commission’s long range plan.
   The table also lists coefficients for various surfaces which may be used to
develop a composite runoff coefficient based on the percentage of different
surfaces within a drainage area.
   Developments on highly permeable soils, such as Spinks and certain Casco and
Fox soils, with a permeability rate of six (6) inches per hour or greater, may
reduce the imperviousness coefficient on agricultural, open space, and yard
areas by 50 percent of the tabulated values.
   The designer should refer to the Soil Survey of Allen County, Ohio,
publication by the Ohio Department of Natural Resources for general locations
of various types in this area.

City Engineer may require breakdown of acres by land use for evaluation of
runoff rates.
Rainfall Intensity
   The basis for computing rainfall intensity shall be the ten-year rainfall
intensity duration curve for the Lima-Allen County area.  This curve, relating
the expected rainfall intensity in inches per hour, to the storm duration in
minutes, is expressed in tabular form on
Table A, and shall be used to estimate design discharges.
   The ten year values can be converted to other recurrence years by applying
the following factors:
 
TO CONVERT TO      MULTIPLY TABLE VALUE BY
1 year frequency  0.55
2 year frequency  0.67
5 year frequency  0.86
10 year frequency 1.00
25 year frequency 1.21
50 year frequency 1.43
Time of Concentration
   One of the basic assumptions underlying the Rational Method is that runoff
is a function of the average rainfall rate during the time required for water
to flow from the most remote part of the drainage area under consideration to
the design point.  The time of concentration determines the average rainfall
rate on the rainfall intensity-duration-frequency curve.
   Four urban storm sewers, the time of concentration consists of an inlet
time, or time required for runoff to flow over the surface to the nearest
inlet, and time of flow in the sewer to the point under consideration.  Inlet
time will vary with surface slope, depression storage, surface cover,
antecedent rainfall and infiltration capacity of soil, as well as distance of
surface flow.  Pipe flow time can be calculated by Manning’s Formula.
   Overland flow paths should not be taken perpendicular to contours on
proposed subdivisions since the land will be graded and swales will often
intercept the natural contour, conducting water to the street in less time.
   Inlet time or the initial time of concentration for overland flows can be
estimated from the following nomograph:
 
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/b2fd75cbe95c6422effa7c2cf5f653773ace68e0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-1814.jpg]
Example:   Determine the inlet time for an area where runoff from the most
remote point must traverse 160 feet of lawn area (C-0.45), the 270 feet in a
paved gutter to the point of concentration.  Average ground slope is 2 percent
and gutter slope of 1.5 percent.
 
From nomograph:    time across lawn area      =   11.8 min.
         Gutter time         =    06.2 min.
         Total inlet time      =   18.0 min.
U.S. Geological Survey Techniques for Estimating Flood-Peak Discharges of Rural
Unregulated Streams in Ohio (WRI Rep 89-4126) Method.
   This method is used for computing flood-peak discharges with recurrence
intervals between 2 and 100 years and should only be used for unregulated
streams with drainage areas between 0.040 and 6,330 square miles.  This method
should not be used for areas where flood flows are significantly affected by
regulations or where there is urban runoff.
   Information pertinent to the Lima-Allen County area has been abridged from
the Water-Resources Investigations Report 89-4126 (WRI Rep 89-4126) and is
included herein.  However, since the monitoring of various streams is a
continuing effort, the designer should research supplemental sources.  He
should obtain the most recent data available on stream discharges which may
lend application to the area under study.
   The regression equations developed for estimating peak flows Qt for
recurrence intervals 2, 5, 10, 25, 50, and 100 years are estimated below:
   WRI Rep 89-4126 Method:
Qt   =   (RC) (CONTDA):*(SLOPE) Y(STORAGE+1) Z where:
Qt   =   Peak discharge in cubic feet per second for the “t” year recurrent
interval:
RC   =   varying regression constants for different year storms for regions A,
B, or C in Ohio. Allen County is in region B;
CONTDA   =   Main channel slope in feet per mile (between 1.3 and 500);
computed as the difference between the elevations at 10 and 85 percent of the
distance along the main channel from a specified location on the channel to the
topographic divide, divided by the channel distance between the two points;
STORAGE   =   The percentage of the contributing drainage area occupied by
lakes, ponds, and swamps (not to exceed 13%) as explicitly shown on U.S.
Geological Survey 7.5 - minute topographic guadrangle maps;
x,y,z,      =   varying regression exponents for 2, 5, 10, 50, & 100 year storm
equations.
   The multiple-regression equations are applicable to each of three regions in
Ohio, in which Allen County falls in region B.  The appropriate regression
constants and regression exponents must be selected to estimate a flood-peak
discharge for specified recurrence interval at an ungaged site within region B.

1).  A procedural example, Sheets G-2a and G-2b, and various flow
characteristic and inlet capacity charts, Charts G-3 to G-7, are included for
use with the computation sheet.
Alignment
   Storm sewers shall be on a constant grade between manholes.
All changes in direction, size, or slope of storm sewers shall be made only at
manholes unless unusual conditions warrant the use of a concrete collar.  In
such cases, approval must be obtained from the City Engineer.
Grades
Storm sewer grades shall provide for a minimum velocity of three (3) feet per
second for the design flow.
Grades shall be such that a minimum cover of three (3) feet can be maintained
over the top of pipe.  Minimum cover beneath roadways shall provide twelve (12)
inches between the top of pipe and the bottom of subbase, with higher strength
pipe being specified.
Substructure Crossings
Crossings with other major underground sewers and utilities should be on an
angle greater than 45 degrees. If insufficient vertical clearance is available,
a concrete cradle with or without steel reinforcement may be required.  The
allowable clearance without special support between storm and sanitary seers
shall be twelve (12) inches.
Manholes
   Manhole spacing shall conform to the following table:
 
PIPE SIZE      MAXIMUM SPACING
15" or less    350 feet
18" or greater 500 feet
   The inside diameter of manholes shall conform to the following table:
 
PIPE SIZE   MANHOLE DIAMETER
24" or less 4 feet
27" to 42"  5 feet
   For pipe sizes over 42", manhole details shall be approved by the City
Engineer.
   Materials
Materials for storm seers and appurtenant structures shall be approved by the
City Engineer.  When alternate types of materials are included for bidding
purposes, hydraulic designs must be developed for each alternate material to
demonstrate its acceptability.
The designer shall evaluate the trench conditions and pipe loading to determine
strength classifications required for various conduits in the design.
   Catch Basin Inlets
Catch basin inlets shall be curb opening with gutter grate combinations and
shall be approved by the City Engineer.  Any catch basin located outside of
curb and gutter shall have flat grates with sufficient opening.
To determine pavement inlet spacing, the design discharge shall be based on the
Rational Method using a two-year frequency, 15-minute duration design storm. 
For the Lima-Allen County area, the expected rainfall intensity for such a
storm is 3.1 inches per hour.
The spread of water on the pavement shall be limited to eight (8) feet into the
outside traveled lane for the design storm.  On continuous grade streets the
maximum depth of flow shall be five (5) inches.
At all intersections it will be necessary to remove one hundred percent (100%)
of pavement flow to eliminate cross street flow.  The inlets shall be located
at the beginning of the upstream curb return before the crosswalk.
At sag locations, sufficient basins shall be provided to prevent 25-year storm
flows from overtopping the street R/W lines.  The capacity of grate inlets
under sump conditions is presented graphically in G-7 with a sample computation
illustrated on Sheet G-2a.  The following explanation applies to this same
computation.
After the Total Discharge (Column 7) has been determined and a basin type has
been selected, the Q/P ratio is calculated.  Q is the Total Discharge and P is
the greater perimeter as determined from the Standard Drawing or manufacturer’s
specifications.  From this value, the height of water (H) over the grate can be
established from G-7 along line (a).  Using this H value then, the spread is
determined from the Flow Characteristic Chart G-3.
The maximum spacing between catch basins or from vertical crest point shall be
350 feet on curb and gutter streets and 450 feet on streets with roadside
ditches.
   Connector Pipes
All catch basin connector pipes shall connect to the main line at manholes
unless otherwise approved by the City Engineer.
The connector pipes shall be hydraulically sized to the catch basin capacity. 
Minimum size shall be 12 inches.  Connector pipes under pavement shall be
reinforced concrete pipe.
Direction changes shall not be designed between structures except where
concrete collars may be necessary to avoid major substructure interference. 
Such designs will require approval of the City Engineer.
   Culvert Design
All culverts shall be designed with a uniform barrel cross section throughout
their length.  Location alignment, material specifications, and end treatments,
(e.g., headwalls, wingwalls, riprap, apron slabs), shall be approved by the
City Engineer.
The design discharge shall be computed for a 50-year frequency storm either by
the Rational Method or the U.S.G.S. Techniques for Estimating Flood-Peak
Discharges of Rural, Unregulated Streams in Ohio (WRI Rep 89-4126) Method,
whichever is applicable with respect to drainage area.
All new culvert designs must be of adequate capacity to convey anticipated
runoff of a watershed from a fifty (50) year frequency storm at just full flow,
using Manning’s equation for capacity calculations.  Pressure flows for fifty
50) year design storms shall be avoided.  Culverts shall meet manufacturer’s
recommendations for minimum and maximum cover, for bedding, and for
backfilling.  Flow line elevations of proposed culverts may be required by the
City Engineer to be up to 1.5 feet below existing ditch flow line, for
anticipated ditch clean-outs.
Computation of culvert hydraulics and barrel sizing shall be prepared by a
Professional Engineer and shall be reviewed and approved by the City Engineer.
Example: given a “Q” of 1.0 c.f.s., find Normal and Critical Depths for a 12"
concrete pipe, “n” -.015, on a slope of .01.  For Normal Depth “D”, follow the
vertical discharge line marked 1.0 to the intersection of the slope line marked
.01.  From that point, follow horizontally, intersecting 12" normal depth
curve.  Thence from that intersection vertically to top of chart, reading a
normal depth of 0.36 feet.  For Critical Depth “Dc”, follow the vertical
discharge line marked 1.0 to the intersection of 12" critical depth curve. 
From that point, follow horizontally to the left margin, reading a critical
depth of 0.42 feet.
Normal depth is the depth at which water will flow in a pipe by virtue of its
slope and roughness based on Manning’s Formula A=(1.486/n)(R 2/3) (S 1.2) A.
Critical depth is the depth at which point the control for determining the
headwater changes.  Always use n=.015 Discharge Scale to determine critical
depth.
Example: Given a “Q” of 70 c.f.s., find the velocity in a 48" concrete pipe on
a slope of 0.004.
From the Pipe Capacity Curve, the normal depth reads 3.0 feet.  Enter Chart c
and follow the vertical normal depth line marked 3.0 feet to the 48" curve
intercept.  From this intersection move horizontally to the left margin reading
a velocity of 10 f.p.s.  This is the velocity for 100 c.f.s.  The velocity for
70 c.f.s. will equal 10 x *70.100) or 7.0 f.p.s.

(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1137.04  ESTABLISHED; MEMBERS.
   (a)   An administrative board called the Zoning Board of Appeals is hereby
established.  The word Board when used in this Zoning Ordinance shall be
construed to mean the Zoning Board of Appeals.
   (b)   The Planning Commission shall be the Zoning Board of Appeals. If the
Zoning Inspector is the Safety Service Director, then the zoning inspector
shall not be considered a member of the zoning board of Appeals.
   (c)   No member of the Board shall receive a fee for such service, but shall
be paid all expenses incurred while on business of the Board with the prior
approval of Council.
   (d)   Meetings of the Board shall be held at least once a month when there
is business to transact.  There shall be a fixed place of meeting and all
meetings shall be open to the public.  The Board shall adopt its own rules of
procedure and keep a record of its proceedings, showing the action of the Board
and the vote of each member upon each question considered.  The Board may adopt
regulations setting up certain policies and interpretations for the Zoning
Inspector to follow.
   (e)   The presence of three members shall be necessary to hold a meeting. 
An affirmative vote of three members of the Board is necessary to approve or
make any recommendations.
   (f)   The Board shall hear the intervention of any owner of property

building permit, conditional use, non-conforming use or occupancy permit is
pending and shall hear any other parties in interest
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1137.05  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The Zoning Board of Appeals shall hear and decide appeals de novo and
review on appeal, any order, requirement, decision or determination made by the
Zoning Inspector relating to the enforcement of the Zoning Ordinance. It shall
also hear and decide all matters referred to it, or upon which it is required
to pass under the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
   (b)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time, not to exceed thirty days, for
the hearing of an appeal.  At the hearing, any party may appear in person or by
agent or by attorney.
   (c)   The Board shall have no power or authority to change any district
boundaries herein established, except in accordance with the provisions of
subsection(d)(1) hereof.
   (d)   The Board is authorized to grant, upon appeal, such variance from the
terms of the Zoning Ordinance as will not be contrary to the public interest,
where by reason of special conditions, topographical conditions, exceptional
circumstances or district border line situations immediately adjoining existing
developments, the strict application of any provision of the Zoning Ordinance
would result in exceptional practical difficulties or undue hardship upon the
owner of any specific property.  The Board, in passing upon appeals, shall have
the power to vary or modify such strict application or to interpret the meaning
of the Zoning Ordinance so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship provided
that such modification or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the
general purpose and intent of the Zoning Ordinance, so that the health, safety
and general welfare of the community shall be conserved and substantial justice
done.  In the exercise of this power, the Board may, among other variances,
modifications and interpretations, authorize a permit to be issued for the
following:
      (1)   For the extension of a district boundary, where the line, as shown
on the zoning plan, divides a lot in a single ownership at the time of the
passage of the Zoning Ordinance.
      (2)   For the extension of a structure or use into a more restricted
district, immediately adjacent thereto, but such extension shall not extend
more than one lot under the same single ownership at the time of the passage of
the Zoning Ordinance and not to exceed sixty feet beyond the boundary line of
the district in which such building or use is thus authorized.
      (3)   For the enlargement of existing structures, or the erection on the
same lot or plot of ground, of additional structures for trade, business or
industry located in a district restricted against its use or to permit a
variance in the use of existing structures where such enlargement, extension or
variance of such trade, business or industry will not be detrimental to or tend
to alter the character of the neighborhood.
      (4)   For the erection in a business district of a public garage or
service station within fifty feet of a residence district.  In passing upon
such an appeal the Board shall give weight to the consents to such variation
from the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance as shown by the signatures of the
owners in interest and number of sixty percent (60%) of all property within 200
feet of the proposed structure.
      (5)   For the use of land and the erection and alteration of structures
in an “I” industrial district for the prohibited uses listed in Section
1165.02, provided the Board determines that such uses are reasonably necessary
and essential for the public convenience or welfare and not seriously
detrimental to the character of the district in question.  Permits for such
uses shall be issued only after a public hearing.
      (6)   For a temporary building in an “R” residential district where such
building is incidental to a residential development; such permit shall be
issued for a period of not more than one year.  Such temporary building shall
be removed on order of the Inspector.
      (7)   For the temporary use of a building or premises in any district for
a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed by the
Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located; provided that such
use be of a temporary nature and does not involve the erection of substantial
buildings.  Such permit shall be granted in the form of a temporary and
revocable permit for not more than a twelve month period subject to such
conditions as will safeguard the public health, safety, convenience and general
welfare.
      (8)   Waive or modify parking and loading requirements in such instances
where the proposed character or use of the building does not require the full
provision of parking or loading facilities, or where their full provisions
would impose an unreasonable hardship upon the use of the lot, as contrasted
with merely granting an advantage or a convenience.
      (9)   Permit a variation in the yard requirements of any district, where
there are unusual or practical difficulties due to topographical or other
conditions, or irregular lot shape, provided such variation will not seriously
affect any adjoining property or the general welfare.
   Nothing in the Zoning Ordinance shall give the Board the power to act for
Council.
(Ord. 2002-25.  Passed 4-8-03.)
   1137.06  PROCEDURE FOR APPEALS.
   (a)   An appeal to the Zoning Board of Appeals may be made by any person
directly affected by a decision of the Zoning Inspector.  Such appeal shall be
taken within twenty days after such decision by filing with the Zoning
Inspector a notice, in writing, of his intention to appeal.  Notices of appeal
shall be made on forms provided by the Board.  The Zoning Inspector shall
forthwith transmit to the Board all papers constituting the record upon which
the action appealed from was taken.
   (b)   The Board shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of the appeal,
give ten days notice to contiguous property owners, and decide the same within
sixty days after the date of submission of the appeal.  Upon the hearing, any
party may appeal in person or agent or by attorney.  The Board may reverse or

determination, as in its opinion ought to be made, and to that end, shall have
all powers of the officer from whom the appeal was taken.

oriented entertainment of their intended market.  Neither is it the intent nor
effect of this chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene
material.
    (b)    Findings.  The City Council has received substantial evidence
concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult uses on a community in

   1321.01  FLOOD CONTROL GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Lands to Which This Chapter Applies.  This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the City of Delphos as
identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, including any additional
flood hazard areas annexed by the City of Delphos that are not identified on
the effective Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM).
   (b)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  The areas
of special flood hazard have been identified by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "Flood
Insurance Study for the City of Delphos".  This study with accompanying Flood
Boundary and Floodway Maps and/or Flood Insurance Rate Maps dated May 2, 2013,
and any revisions thereto is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a
part of this chapter.  The Flood Insurance Study is on file at 608 North Canal
Street, Delphos, OH 45833.
   (c)   Compliance.  No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered without full
compliance with the terms of this chapter, the Delphos Flood Damage Reduction
and Floodplain Management Regulations and any applicable regulations which
apply to uses within the jurisdiction of this chapter, unless specifically
exempted from filing for a development permit as stated in the Delphos Flood
Damage Reduction and Floodplain Management Regulations.
   (d)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easements, covenants or deed
restrictions.  However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement,
covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
   (e)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by  this chapter and the Delphos Flood Damage Reduction and Floodplain
Management Regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is

         C.   If time does not permit adequate deliberation, the matter should

   (e)   Decision by the Board.  Regardless of any continuances of the hearing,
the Board shall make every effort to render a decision to issue or deny the
application within thirty (30) days after the application was first considered
at a regular or special meeting, unless an extension of time is agreed to by
the applicant.
      (1)   The Board shall consider the application(s), plans and
specifications, and determine whether the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alterations or demolition is appropriate, or whether it has an
adverse effect upon the purposes of the Downtown Business District.  In making
such determination, the Board shall refer to Section
1351.11 (Design Review Procedures for the Downtown Business District.).  The
Board shall issue its decision in the form of a written Final Order in which it
expressly sets forth the findings and conclusions of fact used as the basis or
rationale for the decision.
      (2)   If the applicant has proven by the preponderance of substantial,
reliable and probative evidence on the whole record that the proposed activity
will have no adverse effect on a Historic Resource or the historic character or
architectural integrity of all or a portion the Design Review Overlay District,
then the Design Review Board shall vote to grant or approve the application,
subject to the imposition of any reasonable conditions provided for by the
Zoning Ordinance, and cause the Secretary to endorse a Certificate of
Appropriateness and return one copy of the applications, plans and
specifications to the applicant.
         A.   The Certificate of Appropriateness may include any conditions
placed upon the approval regarding the proposed activity.  Such conditions
shall be made part of any subsequent zoning approval.  Receiving a Certificate
of Appropriateness does not negate requirements to adhere to all other City
zoning regulations and City, County and/or State building regulations.
         B.   When a Certificate of Appropriateness is issued for demolition,
the applicant shall receive further instruction that new in-fill construction
in the Downtown Business District is subject to review by the Board.
         C.   The Certificate of Appropriateness will be valid for one year
from the date of approval.
      (3)   If however, the Board determines that the proposed construction,
reconstruction, alteration or demolition will have an adverse effect on the
district violates the spirit and purposes of these regulations, then the Board
shall deny issuance of the Certificate of Appropriateness.  If the Certificate
of Appropriateness is denied or rejected, the applicant shall be notified in
writing of the following:
         A.   The reasons for denial, rejection, and/or recommendation, if any.
         B.   The Board shall offer to undertake continuing and meaningful
discussions with the applicant over a period of at least thirty (30) days, but
not to exceed six (6) months, from the date of disapproval, during which time
the Board shall offer to undertake continued and meaningful discussions, with
the owner of the property in order to develop a compromise proposal acceptable
to both.  In the case of an application for demolition, the Board shall offer
to investigate the feasibility of all means of preserving the listed property,
including purchase by a third party.
            1.   If a compromise proposal is accepted by both parties, or if
the Board determines that preservation of a structure proposed for demolition
is not feasible, the Board may henceforth reverse its Final Order and issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness.
            2.   If the Board and applicant cannot agree on a means of
preserving the structure at the initial meeting, then the Board shall continue
to schedule good faith meetings at least every forty-five (45) days after the
initial meeting.  If the applicant fails to meet with the Board in good faith,
at the time specified, then discussions may terminate.  Upon termination for
any reason, the Board shall inform the applicant in writing of the termination
of such good faith discussions and that the Final Order for denial of the
application shall stand.
            3.   If, after holding such good faith meeting(s) over the
continued discussion period specified by the Board, no alternative property use
is developed or no offer to preserve the structure or architecturally
significant features is made by the applicant, the City or a third party, then
the Design Review Board may also consider whether failure to issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness will create a substantial hardship to the
applicant and whether such Certificate may be issued without substantial
detriment to the public welfare and without substantial derogation from the
purposes of this Section.  In such event, the Board may grant the application,
with or without modifications, and the Secretary of the Board shall issue a
Certificate of Appropriateness for such proposed construction, reconstruction,
or alteration.
   (f)   Appeal of Design Review Board Decision.  An applicant who has received
an approval subject to modifications or has been denied a Certificate of
Appropriateness by the Design Review Board may appeal the decision to the City
Zoning Board of Appeals.
      (1)   Any such appeal shall be made within thirty (30) days of the date
of the Final Order or the date of termination of good faith discussions by the
Board.
      (2)   Grounds for the appeal shall be given by the applicant in the
papers submitted and the grounds shall be limited to procedural errors by the
Board, failure by the Board to consider the entire record presented to the
Board with respect to the application, an incomplete explanation for the
decision reach by the Board, or where there has been a clear misapplication of
either the design review guidelines of the Downtown Business District.
      (3)   When considering an appeal, the City Zoning Board of Appeals shall
refer to the written guidelines adopted by the Board and the entire record
before the Board.
      (4)   The City Zoning Board of Appeals may request additional information
from the Board and/or from the applicant.
      (5)   The City Zoning Board of Appeals may affirm, reverse, or modify the
Board’s decision.  If the City Zoning Board of Appeals affirms the decision,
the denial of the Certificate will stand.  If the City Zoning Board of Appeals
reverses or modifies the decision of the Board, it shall state the reasons for
the reversal or modification.

(Ord. 2006-11.  Passed 4-25-06.)
   1351.11  DESIGN REVIEW STANDARDS.
   (a)   Design Principles.  The properties in the Downtown Business District
define an urban space that represents the historic character of the City.  In
order to enhance the quality and compatibility of these structures, all
proposed rehabilitation, restoration, and new construction projects shall
incorporate common aesthetic principles that are represented in this urban
environment.  These principles include:
      (1)   Proportion.  The relationship of the dimensions of building details
such as windows or doors, or entire facades from one building to the next shall
create a desired harmony of buildings within and surrounding the proposed
development area.
      (2)   Scale.  The size of buildings and building elements with respect to
each other as well as the human form shall be consistent with the prevailing
scale of the buildings.
      (3)   Rhythm.  The repetition of design in building details, such as the
number and spacing of windows and doors, and backgrounds, such as walls, shall
maintain the architectural rhythm of the existing facades.
      (4)   Variety and Unity.  Projects shall blend both variety and unity in
building design through varying levels of distinction in combining building
elements in order to maintain a compatible built environment that is
characterized by unifying qualities of proportion, scale and rhythm.
   (b)   DRGs Generally Applicable to all Proposals in the District.  In the
Downtown Business District, each proposal shall meet the following Design
Review Guidelines (DRGs), however, where a building is or is proposed as an
Historic Resource, components may only be replaced with proof they are
irreparable:
      (1)   Compliment the height, width and general proportions of adjacent
buildings so that an overall harmonious appearance is created.
      (2)   Exterior walls over fifty (50) feet in length that are visible from
adjoining streets or properties shall be articulated to add architectural
interest and variety and avoid the effect of a single, long or massive wall
with no relation to human size.  Articulation shall be visually established by
using architectural features such as columns, ribs or pilasters, piers, and
fenestration pattern.  In addition, include at least two (2) of the following
within each successive articulation:
         A.   Change in wall plane, such as projections or recesses extending
at least 20 percent of the length of the facade;
         B.   Change in texture or masonry pattern;
         C.   Windows; or
         D.   An equivalent element that subdivides the wall into human scale
proportions.
      (3)   Preserve or restore original building facades to the extent
practicable, including the removal of any applied facades that have original
building details preserved beneath.  Include architectural features that are
appropriate and compatible with the design of existing buildings and
structures, including the patterns of windows and doors, roof pitch, cornice
lines, shutters, dormers, eaves and other decorative detail.  Preserve and/or
develop, whenever possible, the distinguishing architectural styles from the
turn-of-the-century reflected in many of the facade details, such as pressed
metal or corbelled cornices.  If major facade components are badly deteriorated
or missing (and replicas are not feasible), great care should be taken to
replace them with creative designs that reflect the proportions, scale, and
details of the original.
      (4)   Maintain or compliment existing colors, textures, and bonding
patterns of brick and other building materials found throughout the Downtown
Business District or typical to the structure’s historical architectural design
whenever possible.  Utilize color schemes appropriate to the architectural of
the structure and the area, limiting strong accent colors for special effects
only.  Existing masonry shall not be sandblasted and mortar joints should only
be re-pointed where there is evidence of moisture problems or when sufficient
mortar is missing to allow water to collect in the mortar joint.  If brick is
currently painted, it may be repainted.
      (5)   Maintain the design, scale and proportion of existing building
windows by preservation of the original proportions of window openings, the
widths of single and double module windows that reflect the architectural lines
of the upper part of the facade, the original arrangement or similar
configurations of glass panes, and the original materials used in such window
elements as sashes, frames, sills, jambs, and lintels.  Vinyl-clad wood windows
of the same style may be acceptable replacements for wood windows.  Wood may be
placed over glass panels on a storefront facade if the muntins are retained and
the wood is painted a comparable color.  Aluminum, triple-track storm windows
may be allowed if painted the same color as the actual window frame and the
crossbar aligns with the interior window sash.  Safety glass may be used. 
Window air conditioners shall be permitted.
      (6)   Awnings of the traditional, forty-five (45) degree style and
compatible color are permissible.  Metal awnings will not be approved unless
the replacement of existing metal awnings in the rear of a building, or if they
contribute to the historic integrity of the front of an Historic Resource.
      (7)   Entrance doors and hardware should maintain and contribute to the
established scale, materials and design of a building or the area.  Rear doors
may be allowed to be replaced with steel doors where the proposed doors
maintain architectural character with insets, windows, etc.
      (8)   Porch and step alterations or new construction should maintain and
contribute to the historic character of a building or the area.
      (9)   Modern roofing material will be permitted if the roof is not
substantially altered, where the proposed materials are superior to the
original products and methods used for roofing, and where the changes are
visible, the proposed changes meet the aesthetic purposes of the Design Review
Overlay District.
      (10)   Enhance individual building design through plant material accents.
   (c)   DRG’s Generally Applicable to Commercial Building Proposals in a B-
2 Business District.  Where the Downtown Business District overlays a B-
2 Zoning District, each proposal shall:
      (1)   Maintain the established storefront widths along established block
facades.  Fill in open spaces between buildings of existing block facades,
either through the development of a building, landscape features or a
combination of both, or public walkways to rear parking areas to preserve or
create a unified street wall.
      (2)   Maintain repetitive window modules along established block
facades.  When the wall of a commercial building faces a public right-of-way,
parking area, or is within 45 degrees of facing a public right-of-way, a
minimum of fifty (50) percent of such wall area, measured between two- and one-
half (2.5) feet and eight (8) feet above the average grade of the building
facade, shall incorporate display-type windows.  The bottom edge of such window
shall not be higher than three (3) feet above grade.  A maximum of twenty (20)
percent of such window may be opaque.
      (3)   The continuity along each block shall be enhanced through the use
of landscaping, street furniture, and brick paving.
   (d)   DRGs for Properties Identified as a Historic Resource in the District.
      (1)   Alterations or changes.  Any exterior construction or improvements
proposed to property containing an Historic Resource shall be based upon design
standards in the underlying Zoning District as well as standards developed by
the Design Review Board and implemented by City Council.  Until such time as
the design standards are developed by the Design Review Board, all applications
for a Certificate of Appropriateness shall conform to the U.S. Secretary of
Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and the Standards in the American
Planning Association  Planning and Advisory Service Report Number 379, titled
Appearance Codes for Small Communities by Peggy Glassford.  Copies of the
Standards are available in the Office of the Zoning Administrator and include
the following evaluative criteria:
         A.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use
for a property which requires minimal alteration of the building, structure, or
site and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended
purpose.
         B.   The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building,
structure, or site and its environment shall not be destroyed.  The removal or
alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural feature should
be avoided when possible.
         C.   All buildings, structures, and sites shall be recognized as
products of their own time.  Alterations that have no historical basis or which
seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.
         D.   Changes which may have taken place in the course of time may be
evidence of the history and development of a building, structure, or site and
its environment.  These changes may have acquired significance and shall be
recognized and respected.
         E.   Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled
craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated
with sensitivity.
         F.   Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than
replaced, wherever possible.  In the event replacement is necessary, the new
material should match the material being replaced in composition, design,
color, texture, and other visual qualities.  Repair or replacement of missing
architectural features, substantiated by historic, physical, or pictorial
evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different
elements from other buildings or structures.
         G.   The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the
gentlest means possible.  Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will
damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.
         H.   Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve
archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.
         I.   Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing
properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not
destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural materials, and such
design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material, and character of
the property, neighborhood or environment.
         J.   Whenever possible, new additions or alterations to structures
shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be
removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would
be unimpaired.
      (2)   Demolition applications.  When the application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness is for demolition of an identified Historic Resource or has the
potential for future designation as a Historic Resource, the Board shall
undertaken meaningful discussion with the applicant and expend every effort to
find a means of preserving the property.
   (e)   Design Review Standards for Properties Not Designated as Historic
Resources.  Upon the receipt of a request for a Certificate of Appropriateness
involving property which does not contain an identified Historic Resource, the
Board shall determine appropriateness by whether the proposed activity will
have an affect on the historic character and architectural integrity of the
Downtown Business District.  In addition, new construction in the Downtown
Business District shall be evocative of the general architectural styles,
historic character, and architectural integrity of the district.  Demolition
shall be allowed if a building lacks historic integrity.
(Ord. 2006-11.  Passed 4-25-06.)
   1351.12  MINIMUM MAINTENANCE REQUIREMENTS.
   The owner of a historic structure or any structure within the Downtown
Business District, if such structure is vacant and uninhabited, shall provide
sufficient maintenance and upkeep for such structure to ensure its perpetuation
and to prevent its destruction by deterioration.
(Ord. 2006-11.  Passed 4-25-06.)
   1351.13  GENERAL ORDINANCE PROVISIONS.

persons responsible for the structure or equipment in accordance with Section
1365.04(y).  The notice shall be in the form prescribed in Section
1365.04(z).
   (i)   Vacation of Condemned Structure.  When a structure or part thereof is

chapter and shall be designated and identified as a condemned structure and
shall be vacated, and it shall not thereafter be re- occupied without the

occupants must vacate the premises at the time set for correction of defects,
if there is failure of compliance.
         A.   When, in the opinion of the "Code Enforcement Department or
Safety Service Director", there is imminent danger of failure or collapse of a
building or structure that endangers life, or when any structure or part of a
structure has fallen and life is endangered by occupation of the structure, or
when there is actual or potential danger to the occupants or those in proximity
of any structure because of explosives, explosive fumes or vapors or the
presence of toxic fumes, gases or materials, or operation of defective or
dangerous equipment, the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service
Director" is hereby authorized and empowered to order and require the occupants
to vacate the premises immediately.
   (j)   Closing of Vacant Structures.
      (1)   If a structure is vacant and unsecured, or unfit for human
habitation and occupancy, and is not in danger of structural collapse, the
"Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director", is authorized to post
a placard of condemnation on the premises and order the structure closed up so
as not to be an attractive nuisance. Upon failure of the owner to close up the
premises within the time specified in the order, the "Code Enforcement
Department or Safety Service Director", shall cause the premises to be closed
through any available public agency or by contact or arrangement with private
persons, and the cost thereof shall be collected in accordance with subsection
(j)(3) hereof.
      (2)   In the event the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service
Director", determines that a vacant and unsecured structure, poses an immediate
danger to the safety or wellbeing of the public or any person, then the "Code
Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director" is authorized to immediately
cause said structure to be closed and secured, without prior notice to the
owner or other appropriate person. The expenses therefore shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the premises.
      (3)   In the event that the owner or other appropriate person fails to
pay the expenses for the work performed pursuant to subsection (j)(2) hereof,
within thirty days after being notified in writing, by regular mail, of the
amount thereof by the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director",
such expenses may be collected using on or more of the following methods
provided, however, that the expenses may only be collected once:
         A.   Such expenses may be certified by Council to the County Auditor
and placed upon the tax duplicate for collection as a special assessment and
thereupon shall be collected as other taxes and assessments; or
         B.   The Director of Law is authorized to bring suit and take other
necessary legal action to collect all such expenses.
      (4)   No structure which has been closed under this section, or which
otherwise has been closed or boarded-up by any other person, shall remain
closed or boarded-up for a period longer than six months. The repair shall
result in openings secured by conventional methods used in the design of the
building or by methods permitted for new construction of similar type. No owner
of a structure, or other person legally responsible for a structure, shall fail
to repair any doors, windows or other openings which are boarded up or
otherwise secured by any means other than conventional methods used in the
design of the building or permitted for new construction of a similar type, or
fail to cause the structure to be compliant with this Property Maintenance Code
after the expiration of said six-month period.
      (5)   All doors, windows and other openings shall be covered with a
minimum of one-half inch thick painted structural sheeting material or solid
nominal one-inch lumber, closely butted at the edges and maintained. Such
coverings may be installed to fit over the exterior casing or to fit tightly
inside the exterior casing coverings the sash area only. However,  there shall
not be any edges or cracks that will serve as handholds for tearing off of the
same. All coverings shall be anchored by nails or screws and shall not be
capable of being removed without tools. Any porch floor, railing, post or roof,
or any other attachment to the structure, in danger of falling or causing
injury by being decayed or having holes that could cause tripping or falling,
shall be repaired and maintained. All loose debris and discarded boards and
lumber shall be kept clear of the premises.
   (k)   Placarding.  Upon failure of the owner or person responsible to comply
with the notice provisions within the time given, the "Code Enforcement
Department or Safety Service Director" shall post on the premises or on
defective equipment, a placard bearing the word "Condemned" and a statement of
the penalties provided for occupying the premises, operating the equipment or
removing the placard.
   
   (l)   Prohibited Occupancy.  Any person who shall occupy a placarded premise
or shall operate placarded equipment, and any owner or any person responsible
for the premises, who shall let anyone occupy a placarded premise or operate
placarded equipment, shall be subject to the penalties provided in this Code.
   (m)   Authority to Disconnect Utility Service.  The "Code Enforcement
Department or Safety Service Director" shall have authority to authorize
disconnection of utility service to the building, structure or system regulated

without approval. The "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director"
shall notify the serving utility and, whenever, possible, the owner or owner's

occupant of the building, structure or service system shall be notified in
writing as soon as practical thereafter.
   (n)   Removal of Placard.  The "Code Enforcement Department or Safety
Service Director" shall remove the condemnation placard whenever the defect or
defects upon which the condemnation and placarding action were based have been
eliminated. Any person who defaces or removes a condemnation placard without
the approval of the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director",
shall be subject to the penalties provided in this Code.
   (o)   Order to Raze or Repair Structure.  The "Code Enforcement Department
or Safety Service Director" may order the owner of any premises upon which is
located any structure or part thereof, which in the judgment of the "Code
Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director" or Fire Chief or their
designee is so old, dilapidated or has become so out of repair as to be
dangerous, unsafe, unsanitary or otherwise unfit for human habitation,
occupancy or use, and so that it would be unreasonable to repair the same, to
raze and remove such structure or part thereof; or, if it can be made safe by
repairs, to repair and make safe and sanitary or to raze and remove at the
owner's option within sixty days of such order. In the event, the owner, within
such sixty-day period, elects to repair the subject premises, such repairs
shall commence within such sixty-day period and shall, in all cases, be
completed within four months of the original order given by the "Code
Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director".
      (1)   Whenever the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service
Director" determines that the cost of such repairs would exceed one hundred
percent (100%) of the current value of such structure, such repairs shall be
presumed unreasonable and it shall be presumed for the purposes of this chapter
that such structure is a public nuisance which may be ordered razed without
option on the part of the owner to repair.
      (2)   Whenever the owner of a property fails to comply with a demolition
order within the time prescribed, the "Code Enforcement Department, Safety
Service Director or Fire Chief or their designee shall cause the structure or
part thereof to be razed and removed, either through an available public agency
or by contract or arrangement with private persons. The expenses therefore call
be the responsibility of the owner of the premises.
      (3)   In the event that the owner or other appropriate person fails to
pay the expenses for the work performed pursuant to subsection (b) hereof,
within thirty days after being notified in writing, by regular U.S. mail, of
the amount thereof by the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service
Director", such expenses may be collected using one or more of the following
methods provided, however, that the expenses may only be collected once:
         A.   Such expenses may be certified by Council to the County Auditor
and placed upon the tax duplicate for collection as a special assessment and
thereupon shall be collected as other taxes and assessments; or
         B.   The Director of Law is authorized to bring suit and take other
necessary legal action to collect all such expenses.
   (p)   Fees.   The fees described in this Section are established in order to
defray the cost to the City government and community as a whole related to the
health, safety and economic impacts of structures which remain vacant for long
periods of time, including but not limited to administrative costs for
registering and processing the vacant building owner registration form and for
the costs incurred by the City in monitoring the vacant building site. The fees
are also structured in order to provide appropriate incentives for owners of
vacant buildings to care for them properly, seek to fill them, and in
appropriate cases demolish them. The annually increased fee amounts are
intended to absorb the costs incurred by the City for demolition and hazard
abatement of or repairs to vacant buildings, as well as the continued normal
administrative costs stated above.
      (1)   The owner of a vacant building shall pay a fee of two hundred
dollars ($200.00) for the first year the building remains vacant. For every
consecutive year that the building remains vacant, an annual fee will be
assessed at double the previous year's fee amount for a maximum annual fee
equaling the five-year fee of three thousand two hundred dollars ($3,200) to be
used for the fifth and for all consecutive, subsequent years of vacancy.
      (2)   The first annual fee shall be paid at the time the building is
registered. If the owner successfully restores the building to occupancy or
demolishes it in accordance with applicable law during the first year following
registration, the fee shall be refunded, less an administrative charge equal to
5% of the amount refunded. In each subsequent year, if the     registration is
renewed in timely fashion, there have been no violations associated with the
property in the previous year, and re-inspection reveals no significant
housing, building or fire code violations, one-half of the previous year's
registration fee shall be refunded to the owner, less an administrative charge
equal to 5% of the amount refunded.
      (3)   The fee shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of any building
permits unless the property is granted an exemption.
      (4)   All delinquent fees shall be paid by the owner prior to any
transfer of an ownership interest in the vacant building. A lien may be placed
on the property to collect delinquent fees.
      (5)   Absent a showing of good cause, if a building is not registered
within the time frame or the registration is not renewed within 30 days after
the expiration of one year from the date of the previous registration, a
penalty shall be paid in addition to the annual registration fee. The penalty
shall be equal to one-half of the current annual fee or one thousand dollars
($1,000), whichever is less.
   (q)   Exemptions.
      (1)   A building under active construction, reconstruction or renovation
and having a valid building permit(s) at the time of initial inspection shall
be exempt from registration until the expiration of the longest running,
currently active building permit.
      (2)   A building which has suffered fire damage or damage caused by
extreme weather conditions shall be exempt from the registration requirement
for a period of 90 days after the date of the fire or extreme weather event if
the property owner submits a request for exemption in writing to the Service-
Safety Director or his duly designated representative. This request shall
include the names and addresses of the owner or owners, and a statement of
intent to repair and reoccupy the building in an expedient manner, or the
intent to demolish the building. One extension of not more than 90 days'
duration may be granted for good cause shown.
      (3)   A building that is for sale and listed with a licensed State of
Ohio Realtor shall be exempted for a period of 12 months from the start of
vacancy, provided that the owner submits proof to the "Code Enforcement
Department or Safety Service Director".  of such listing and for sale status,
and the building and premises in maintained free of any Property Maintenance
Violations
      (4)   A building that has been granted an exemption pursuant to the
following: Any owner of a vacant building may voluntarily register the same and
request an exemption from the remaining provisions of this chapter by filing a
written application with the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service
Director", who shall timely consider same. In determining whether a request for
exemption should be granted, the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service
Director" shall consider the following:
         A.   The applicant's prior record as it pertains to City Zoning Code,
Building Code, or Property Maintenance Code violations; the amount of vacant
property the applicant currently has within the City;
         B.   The length of time that the building for which the exception is
sought has been vacant; the reason or reasons for the vacancy;
         C.   And the difficulty or expense involved in any necessary
remediation or demolition.
      (5)   No exemption from registration shall be granted unless the owner or
representative first completes a vacant building plan and addresses any and all
existing code violations. An owner who believes he or she is being denied an
exemption for arbitrary or capricious reasons may file an appeal of such denial
within ten days with the City Council, which may sustain, overturn or modify
the action of the "Code Enforcement Department or Safety Service Director",
   (r)   Appeals.  Any owner who is served a notice of vacant property
registration, may, within ten (10) calendar days of receipt of such notice,
