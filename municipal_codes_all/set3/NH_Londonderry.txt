manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. (Charter,
Section 3.8)

SECTION I PURPOSE
A. The Town of Londonderry owns and manages many recreational facilities,

Londonderry Charter.

All applications and recommendations of the Committee will be forwarded to the
Town Council for consideration.
B. Recognition by the Recreation Commission does not guarantee exclusivity to
times or locations of any facility.
C. Upon approval of an Sanctioned Group by the Town Council, that Group is
eligible to utilize town recreation facilities pursuant to the use and scheduling
policies and practices as promulgated by the Recreation Commission.
SECTION IV ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA
A. In order to be considered eligible for approval as an Sanctioned Recreation
Group, the following guidelines shall be met:

approved by the town council.

3 ZONING MAP AND ZONING DISTRICTS
3.1 Zoning Map and District Boundaries
A. The location and boundaries of the Londonderry zoning districts are shown on the “Zoning Map
of the Town of Londonderry, New Hampshire” dated June 9, 1994 or as most recently updated
and signed and certified by the Town Clerk, which is part of this Ordinance. Where any
uncertainty exists with respect to the boundary of any District as shown on the Zoning Map, the
following rules shall apply:
1. Where a boundary is indicated as a highway, street, railroad, watercourse or Town
boundary, it shall be construed to be the centerline thereof or such Town boundary.
2. Where a boundary is indicated as approximately parallel to a highway, street, railroad,
watercourse, or Town boundary, it shall be construed to be parallel to the centerline
thereof or such Town Boundary.
3. Where a boundary coincides within ten (10) feet or less with a lot line, the boundary shall
be construed to be the lot line.
4. If no natural boundary is given, the location of any boundary shall be determined by use of
coordinates identified by permanent bounds.
B. If a zoning district boundary line runs through any lot and the lot is of sufficient size and
configuration to permit conforming lots in each district, the lot may be subdivided along the
zoning district boundary line resulting in conforming lots. The subdivision shall be subject to
Planning Board approval in accordance with the Subdivision Regulations.
C. If a zoning district boundary line runs through any lot and the lot is not of sufficient size and
configuration to permit conforming lots in each district, the lot cannot be subdivided and the
entire lot is deemed to be in the more restricted district. For purposes of this section, the order
of most restrictive to least restrictive is as follows: AR-I, R-III, C-IV, POD, C-III, C-I, C-II, IND-I
and IND-II, AD.
D. Overlay Districts, where applicable, are superimposed upon the Base Districts, and the
provisions of the Overlay Districts shall be in addition to the provisions of the Base District.

4.2.1.5 Parking Requirements
A minimum of two parking spaces per dwelling unit shall be provided in the AR-I district.
4.2.2 Multi-Family Residential (R-III)
4.2.2.1 Objectives and Characteristics
The Multi-Family (R-III) district is designed to permit an increased residential density in areas where
municipal services make it appropriate and to promote flexibility in the design of residential projects
with various housing types, reduced lot sizes and modified dimensional requirements, while
maintaining a fixed maximum density. Flexible design can provide for the appropriate use of the land,
facilitate the economical and efficient provision of public services, promote open space conservation,
protect the natural and scenic attributes of the land and expand opportunities for the development
of affordable housing.
4.2.2.2 Uses
A. See Use Table Section 4.1.2
B. Single family and two family dwellings are allowed per the Use Table provided that at least
seventy five percent (75%) of such dwelling units shall be restricted housing for older persons
under the fair housing act, as amended, 42 USC 3601, et.seq., and RSA 354-A:15. Such
restrictions shall be secured by restrictive covenants or similar instrument, approved by the
Board, recorded in the registry of deeds.
C. No lot in the Residential-III (R-III) district may be used for the outside storage of more than one
unregistered motor vehicle (in accordance with RSA 236:92) or the outside storage of more
than one boat other than a rowboat, canoe or other boat less than twenty (20) feet in length.
4.2.2.3 Regulations and Design Criteria

development plan of the tract proposed for development (“development lot”), which
locates the proposed types of residential development, utilities, access roads and streets.
(“development plan”)
a. The development plan shall include general, conceptual site and architectural plans
sufficiently detailed to show the intended land uses, structures, improvements, and
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 37
other features necessary to demonstrate compliance with this Section and other
applicable provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.
b. The applicant may elect to develop the development lot in phases.
c. Final approval of development of any portion of the development lot shall require site
plan approval according to the Site Plan Regulations of the Planning Board.
d. Once development of any portion of the development lot begins, no portion of the
development lot may thereafter be developed or used except in conformity with the
approved development plan, or an amended development plan approved by the Board.
2. The development lot may, but need not, be divided into two or more smaller legal separate
lots of record (“internal legal lots”), which shall require subdivision approval by the
Planning Board.
3. The density, design and dimensional requirements of Section 4.2.2.3(B) shall be applied
to the development lot and not the internal legal lots.
4. The internal legal lots, if any, shall be subject to the density, design and dimensional
requirements of Section 4.2.2.3(C).
5. The applicant shall be permitted to allocate permitted density among the internal legal lots
in any manner so long as the sum total of development for all internal legal lots does not
exceed the permitted density for the development lot.
B. Density, Design and Dimensional Standard for Development Lot
1. Permitted density - the maximum permitted number of dwelling units (“permitted density”)
allowed in the development lot shall be as follows:
a. For dwellings serviced by municipal sewer, the maximum number of dwelling units
permitted on the development lot shall be determined by the following formula:
number of dwelling units = 0.80 (development lot area - unusable land area)/7000
square feet. “unusable land” is defined as wetlands, excessive slopes (greater than
25%) and land subject to existing utility and drainage easements.
b. For dwellings serviced by onsite septic systems, there shall be at least 14,000 square
feet per dwelling unit. In addition, to protect ground water quality and to promote
public health and safety, permitted density shall also be subject to such additional
density requirements as are required by “minimum lot size by soil type” in Table 2 of
Section 9.2.1, with the following modification: one or two bedroom units - lot size x
0.65. Three bedroom units = lot size x 0.85.
c. The maximum number of dwelling units per dwelling shall be sixteen (16).
i. The maximum number of dwelling units in a single building may be increased
from sixteen (16) to no more than twenty (20) if the applicant is granted a
conditional use permit from the Planning Board, in accordance with Section 6.3.5.
d. The average number of bedrooms per dwelling unit in a multifamily dwelling shall not
exceed two (2).
2. Screening, Landscaping and Glare - the development plan and the internal legal lots shall be
designed to screen parking lots from streets by building location, grading or screening and
to minimize glare on adjoining properties. Glare from any use of land, including site
illumination, shall not exceed 0.2 foot candles, measured at ground level, at or beyond the
perimeter of the development lot. Lighting fixtures shall be designed for downward casting
of light. Major topographic changes or removal of existing trees shall be avoided wherever
possible, and water, wetlands and other scenic views shall be preserved wherever possible.

3. Open space - no less than the area calculated below shall be retained as unoccupied space
free of all buildings, parking and pavement, including street access, drives and walks paved
with impervious materials, (but such unoccupied open space may include so-called nature
walk areas and the like and other recreational uses approved by the Planning Board.) Open
space shall be owned by undivided interests appurtenant to lot ownership. Such open space
shall either be maintained in its natural state (except for the walking paths or other uses
approved by the Planning Board) or shall have appropriate landscaping of grass,
shrubbery, trees, flowers, or suitable ground cover indigenous to the area.

walkway shall not, in the opinion of the Planning Board (after consultation with the fire
department) impair access to the buildings by emergency vehicles and equipment.
6. Dimensional requirements
a. Minimum structure setbacks from the perimeter of the development lot shall be as
follows: front - 40 feet; side - 35 feet; rear - 30 feet. If the development lot abuts more
than one existing and/or proposed external right-of-way, the building setback will be
forty (40') feet from each right-of-way.
b. Maximum building height shall not exceed (50') fifty feet (excluding non-occupied

4.4.2 Airport District
4.4.2.1 Objectives and characteristics
A portion of the Manchester Airport (“Airport”) is located in the Town of Londonderry. Development
of the airport benefits the Town and region and a harmonious relationship among the Town, the
airport and the city of Manchester is beneficial to the Town and the airport. Much of the development
at the airport is designed in accordance with federal aviation standards. The purpose of the airport
district is to provide standards for certain uses and structures associated with the airport for which
generally applicable commercial and industrial standards are not suitable.
4.4.2.2 Permitted uses:
See use Table Section 4.1.2 of this Zoning Ordinance
4.4.2.3 General standards
Within the airport district, the following dimensional, density and design standards shall apply:
A. Setbacks - no building shall be located on a lot nearer to the front, side or rear lot line than the
minimum setbacks set forth below:
1. Minimum setback distances for structures from property line
a. front zero (0) feet*
b. side zero (0) feet
c. rear zero (0) feet

F. Parking standards for longer term parking lots (airport district)
1. The design standards for parking within the airport district vary with the intended use of
the parking facility. The high turnover rate for vehicles in airport lots intended for hourly
parking requires adequate room for the maneuvering of multiple vehicles. In longer term
(more than one hour permissible) airport parking lots, the volume of simultaneous traffic
is significantly less, and the dimensional requirements are lower. All parking spaces shall
comply with the design standards of Table A and Figure 1 in Section 3.09 of the Site Plan
Regulations except for longer term airport parking areas which shall follow Table D in
Section 3.09 of the Site Plan Regulations, and its associate parking layout, unless otherwise
approved by the Planning Board.

4.5 Gateway Business District
4.5.1 Objectives and Characteristics
The Gateway Business District (GB) is intended to allow for the development of gateways to the Town
of Londonderry, centers of commerce, and employment centers for the Southern NH region.
It is the desire of the Town of Londonderry that all of these activities be developed in a manner that
both serves the business interests contained in the district, and in a manner that that conveys a
campus atmosphere to those arriving here. Traffic circulation and alternate modes of transportation
need to be provided for, as does parking for employees and visitors alike. A wide variety of industrial,
supporting commercial development, and open space & recreational amenities are desired, in
accordance with the various planning efforts undertaken by the Town in recent years (primarily the
2004 Master Plan which includes the 2003 Londonderry Business Park Design Charrette, and any
other planning efforts as completed and applicable). All of these activities are envisioned as being
developed in a manner that involves quality design of landscaping, a high level of quality in individual
building and site design which takes into account the context of the site in its natural environment,
and flexibility on the part of the Town so as to achieve the design suggested in those documents.

4.6 Overlay Districts
4.6.1 Conservation Overlay District (CO)
4.6.1.1 Objectives and Characteristics
Wetlands, ponds, and streams are significant natural resources of the Town because of their size or
functional values, such as flood storage, wildlife habitat, and the enhancement of water quality
and/or quantity. The preservation of these water resources promotes the general public health,
safety, welfare and convenience in our community. In particular the regulations of the Conservation
Overlay District (CO) are intended to:
A. Maintain and enhance the quality and quantity of surface waters and groundwater by
preserving the ability of wetlands to filter pollution, trap sediment, retain and absorb chemicals
and nutrients, and produce oxygen;
B. Minimize expense to the Town and the public in providing and maintaining essential services
and utilities, such as wastewater collection and treatment, drainage facilities, and public water
supply, which may arise because of the inappropriate use of land within the CO District;
C. Minimize impacts to existing land uses and lots (see Section 4.6.1.7);
D. Prevent the destruction of, or significant changes to, those wetland areas, related water bodies
and adjoining land which provide flood protection; protect persons and property against the
hazards of flood inundation by assuring the continuation of the natural flow patterns of streams
and other watercourses; and provide for nutrient attenuation and augmentation of stream flow
during dry periods;
E. Encourage those uses that can be appropriately and safely located within the CO District.
F. Protect native wildlife habitat and natural vegetation upon which a variety of upland and
aquatic species are dependent for purposes of breeding or sustenance.

market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
“Substantial Improvement” means any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or
improvements to a structure in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds fifty percent of the
market value of the structure. The market value of the structure shall equal: (1) the appraised value
prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement, or (2) in the case of damage, the value of the
structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, “substantial
improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other real
part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the
structure. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of actual
repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a
structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are
solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of a “historic structure”, provided
that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a “historic structure”
“Water Surface Elevation” means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies
in the floodplains
4.6.3.4 Permits
All proposed development in any special flood hazard areas shall require a permit. Development in
these areas and below the base flood level may result in increased premium rates for flood insurance,
and such development may increase risks to life and property.
4.6.3.5 Construction Requirements
The Building Inspector shall review all building permit applications for new construction or
substantial improvements to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe
from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in a special flood hazard area, all new construction
or substantial improvements shall:
A. Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent floatation, collapse, or lateral
movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the
effects of buoyancy,
B. Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage,
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 65
C. Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages,
D. Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment,
and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from
entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.
4.6.3.6 Water and Sewer Systems
Where new or replacement water and sewer systems (including on site systems) are proposed in a
special flood hazard area the applicant shall provide the Building Inspector with assurance that these
systems will be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood waters into the systems and
discharges from the systems into flood waters, and on-site waste disposal systems will be located to
avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during periods of flooding.
4.6.3.7 Certification
For all new or substantially improved structures located in Zones A, A1-30, AE, AO or AH, the
applicant shall furnish the following information to the Building Inspector:
A. The as-built elevation (in relation to NGVD) of the lowest floor (including basement) and
include whether or not such structures contain a basement
B. If the structure has been flood proofed, the as-built elevation (in relation to NGVD) to which the
structure was floodproofed.
C. Any certification of floodproofing.
The Building Inspector shall maintain a record of all structures for public inspection, and shall furnish
such information upon request.
4.6.3.8 Other Required Permits
The Building Inspector shall not grant a building permit until the applicant certifies that all necessary
permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments
of 1972, 33 U.S.C.1334.
4.6.3.9 Watercourses
A. In riverine situations, prior to the alteration or relocation of a watercourse the applicant for
such authorization shall notify the Wetlands Board of the New Hampshire Environmental
Services Department and submit copies of such notification to the Building Inspector, in
addition to the copies required by the RSA 482-A:3 Further, the applicant shall be required to
submit copies of said notification to those adjacent communities as determined by the Building
Inspector, including notice of all scheduled hearings before the Wetlands Board.
B. The applicant shall submit to the Building Inspector, certification provided by a registered
professional engineer, assuring that the flood carrying capacity of an altered or relocated
watercourse can and will be maintained.
C. Along watercourses with a designated Regulatory Floodway, no encroachments, including fill,
new construction, substantial improvements, and other development are allowed within the
floodway unless it has been demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that the proposed encroachment
would not result in an increase in flood levels within the community during the base flood
discharge.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 66
D. Along watercourses that have not had a Regulatory Floodway designated, no new construction,
substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within
zones A1-30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the cumulative
effect of the proposed development, when combined with all existing and anticipated
development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot
at any point within the community.
E. In Zone A, the Building Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway data
available from federal, state, or other sources as criteria for requiring that development meet
the floodway requirements of this section.
4.6.3.10 Special Flood Hazard Areas
A. In special flood hazard areas the Building Inspector shall determine the base flood elevation in
the following order of precedence according to the data available:
1. In zones Al-30, AH and AE, refer to the elevation data provided in the community's Flood
Insurance Study and accompanying FIRM or FHBM.
2. In unnumbered A zones, the Building Inspector shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize
any 100 year floor elevation data available from federal, state, or other source including
data submitted to the community (i.e.: subdivision, site approvals).
3. In zone AO the flood elevation is determined by adding the elevation of the highest adjacent
grade to the depth number specified on the FIRM or if no depth number is specified on the
FIRM at least 2 feet.
B. The Building Inspector's base flood elevation determination will be used as criteria for
requiring in zones A, A1-30, AE, AH, AO, that:
1. All new construction or substantial improvement of residential structures have the lowest
floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood elevation;
2. That all new construction or substantial improvements of non-residential structures have
the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the base flood level; or together
with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:
a. Be flood proofed so that below the base flood elevation the structure is watertight with
walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;
b. Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads
and the effects of buoyancy; and
c. Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and
methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for
meeting the provisions of this section;
3. All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within special flood hazard
areas shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the
manufactured home is at or above the base flood level; and be securely anchored to resist
floatation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not
limited to, use of over the top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in
addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces;
4. Recreational vehicles placed on site within zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall either
a. be on the site for fewer than one hundred and eighty (180) consecutive days,
b. be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 67
c. meet all standards of Section 60.3 (b) (1) of the National Flood Insurance Program
Regulations and the elevation and anchoring requirements for “manufactured homes”
in paragraph C (6) of Section 60.3.
5. For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the
lowest floor that are subject to flooding are permitted provided they meet the following
requirements:
a. the enclosed area is unfinished or flood resistant, usable solely for the parking of
vehicles, building access or storage;
b. the area is not basement;
c. shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater.
Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered
professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum
criteria: A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square
inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The
bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be
equipped with screens, louvers, or other coverings or devices provided that they
permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater.
6. Proposed structures to be located on slopes in special flood hazard areas, zones AH and AO
shall include adequate drainage paths to guide flood waters around and away from the
proposed structures.
4.6.3.11 Variances and Appeals
A. Any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Building Inspector made under this
ordinance may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment as set forth in RSA 676:5.
B. If the applicant, upon appeal, requests a variance as authorized by RSA 674:33, I(b), in
determining whether or not any variance will be contrary to the spirit of this Ordinance, the
Board of Adjustment shall consider the following:
1. That the variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, or extraordinary public expense
2. That if the requested variance is for activity within a designated regulatory floodway, no
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result.
3. That the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
C. The community shall maintain a record of all variance actions, including their justification for
their issuance, and report such variances issued in its annual or biennial report submitted to
FEMA's Federal Insurance Administrator.

Londonderry that lies within the boundaries of the approach zones as defined in paragraph
4.6.4.2(B) hereof and all of the land within a distance of 100,000 feet from the Airport
Reference Point is hereby declared subject to the restrictions of these regulations, in accordance
with the Grenier Air Force Base Airport Approach Plan adopted by the New Hampshire
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 69
Aeronautics Commission on February 25, 1957, which Airport Approach Plan is incorporated
herein by reference.
B. Height Limits
No structure or tree shall be erected, altered or allowed to grow within the areas referred to in
Section B hereof, to wit:
1. In the approach areas to the N/S runway which are 1500' wide at 1000' from the end of the

Point
C. Height Permitted
No provision of paragraph 4.6.4.3(B) shall limit the height of a structure or tree to less than 30'
above the ground upon which it is located.
D. Use Restrictions: Notwithstanding any other provisions of these regulations, no use may be
made of the land described in paragraph 4.6.4.3(A) hereof in such manner as to create electrical
interference with radio aid or communications between the airport and aircraft, make it
difficult for flyers to distinguish between airport lights and others, result in glare in the eyes of
the flyer using the airport, impair visibility in the vicinity of the airport by the creation and
discharge of smoke, steam, dust, or other obstructions to visibility or otherwise endanger the
landing, taking-off, or maneuvering of aircraft.
E. Non-conforming Uses: The regulations prescribed in 4.6.4.3(B) and 4.6.4.3(D) of these
regulations shall not be construed to require the removal, lowering or other change or
alteration of any structure or tree not conforming to the regulations as of the effective date
hereof, or otherwise interfere with the continuance of any non-conforming use. Nothing herein
contained shall require any change in the construction, alteration, or intended use of any
structure and the construction or alteration of which was begun prior to the effective date of
these regulations, and is diligently prosecuted and completed within two years thereof.
F. Variances: Any person desiring to erect any structure or increase the height of any structure,
or permit the growth of any tree, or use his property, not in accordance with these regulations
may apply for a variance therefrom. Such variance shall be allowed where a literal application
or enforcement of the regulations would result in practical difficulty or unnecessary hardship
and the relief granted would not be contrary to the public interest but do substantial justice and
be in accordance with the spirit of these regulations.
G. Permits
1. Future Uses - No material change shall be made in the use of land in violation of paragraphs
4.6.4.3(B) and 4.6.4.3(D) hereof and no structure or tree shall be erected, altered, planted,
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 70
or otherwise established in violation of paragraphs 4.6.4.3(B) and 4.6.4.3(D) hereof in any
of the areas of land described in paragraph 4.6.4.3(A) hereof, unless a permit therefore
shall have been applied for and granted. Each such application shall indicate the purpose
for which the permit is desired, with sufficient particularity to permit it to be determined
whether the resulting use, structure, or tree would conform to the regulations herein
prescribed. If such determination is in the affirmative, the permit applied for shall be
granted.
2. Existing Uses - Before any existing use, structure or tree may be replaced, substantially
altered or repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher or replanted, within any of the areas of
land described in paragraph 4.6.4.3(A) hereof, a permit must be secured authorizing such
replacement, change or repair if it is in violation of paragraphs 4.6.4.3(B) and 4.6.4.3(D)
hereof. No such permit shall be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of
an airport hazard or permit a non-conforming use, structure or tree to be made or become
higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation, than it was on the effective date of
these regulations or than it is when the application for a permit is made. Except as
indicated, all applications for a permit for replacement, change or repair of existing use,
structure, or tree shall be granted.
H. Hazard Marking and Lighting: Any permit or variance granted under paragraphs 4.6.4.3(F)
and 4.6.4.3(G) may, if such action is deemed advisable to effectuate the purposes of these
regulations and reasonable in the circumstances, be so conditioned as to require the owner of
the structure or tree in question to permit the present owner or lessor at his own expense, to
install, operate, and maintain thereon such markers and lights as may be necessary to indicate
to flyers the presence of an airport hazard.
4.6.5 Airport Approach Noise Overlay
4.6.5.1 Objectives:
The increasing aircraft activity that is occurring at the Manchester Boston Regional Airport has
reached the point in which it has become necessary to create noise overlay zoning for the entire area
of Town within the 65 Ldn contour in accordance with the 1991 Part 150 Noise Compatibility Plan
conducted by the Manchester Airport Authority.
4.6.5.2 Definition of Terms:
The following definitions shall apply only to this Noise Overlay Zoning Ordinance, and shall not be
affected by the provisions of any other Ordinance of the Town of Londonderry.
“Day-Night Sound Level” (Ldn): A cumulative aircraft noise index which estimates the exposure
to aircraft noise and relates the estimated exposure to an unexpected community response. The Day-
Night Sound Level noise metric assesses a 10 db penalty to all noise events occurring between 10:00
p.m. and 7:00 a.m.
“Ldn Contour”: A line linking together a series of points of equal cumulative noise exposure based
on the Ldn metric. Such contours are developed based on aircraft flight patterns, number of daily
aircraft operations by type of aircraft and time of day, noise characteristics of each aircraft, and
typical runway usage patterns.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 71
“Navigable Airspace”: The airspace above the minimum altitudes of flight prescribed by
regulations issued under-the Federal Aviation Act of 1958, Section 101(24) 49 United States Codes
1301, including the airspace needed to ensure safety in the takeoff and landing of aircraft.
4.6.5.3 Noise Compatibility Zones Established:
Noise compatibility zones for the area around Manchester-Boston Regional Airport are hereby
established based on the Ldn contours for aircraft noise developed for conditions forecast to exist in
1991 with noise abated operating conditions
A. The N-1 zone generally corresponds to the area between the 65 Ldn and 70 Ldn contours.
B. The N-2 zone generally corresponds to the area between the 70 Ldn and 75 Ldn contours.
C. The N-3 zone generally corresponds to the area within the 75 Ldn contour.
4.6.5.4 Noise Overlay Zone Boundaries:
The boundaries of the Noise Overlay Zones are shown in the Manchester-Boston Regional Airport
Noise Compatibility Plan. Because of the averaging inherent in making Ldn calculations and the
assumptions necessary in the forecasting procedure, the Ldn contour lines are not capable of being
precisely defined in the field. Therefore, the boundaries between the noise overlay zones, while
bearing a very close relationship to the Ldn contour lines, have been adjusted to facilitate
understanding and agreement as to the location of the boundaries.
4.6.5.5 Uses Prohibited:
Land uses prohibited in the noise overlay zones shall be as specified in the Table of Land Use
Compatibility Standards.
4.6.5.6 Soundproofing Required:
Soundproofing shall be required for certain land uses in each of the noise overlay zones as shown in
the Table 3-7, Table of Land Use Compatibility Standards. Where soundproofing is required, no
building permits shall be issued until the builder has demonstrated that the building design is capable
of achieving the Noise Level Reduction required in the Table of Land Use Compatibility Standards.
This requirement can be met in one of two ways as described in the following subsections.
A. Design Standards: If the building design incorporates the design standards described in
Section 4.6.5.7, the design shall be considered to have met the required soundproofing
standards.
B. Performance Standards: The builder may choose to use design features other than those
described in Section 4.6.5.7 as long as the final design is capable of achieving the Noise Level
Reduction required in Table 4-8. Such noise attenuation capability shall be certified on the
building plans by a registered architect, structural engineer, or acoustician.
4.6.5.7 Soundproofing Design Standards
A. Noise Level reduction of 25 Decibels (dB)
1. If wood frame construction is used, all exterior stud walls shall have interior and exterior
surfaces of an approved material at least as massive as half-inch thick gypsum wallboard,

NOTES
1. All residences in the N-1 Zone are marginally noise compatible and shall be soundproofed to achieve a 25 dB reduction
from outdoor noise levels (NLR). All residences in the N-2 Zone are marginally noise compatible and shall be soundproofed to
achieve a 30 dB NLR. Soundproofing will not eliminate outdoor noise problems. However, building location and site planning,
design and use of BERMS and barriers can help mitigate outdoor noise exposure particularly from ground level sources. Measures
that reduce noise at a site shall be used wherever practical in preference to measures which only protect interior spaces.
2. Measures to achieve NLR of 25 shall be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where
the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.
3. Measures to achieve NLR of 30 shall be incorporated into the design and construction of portions of these buildings where
the public is received, office areas, noise sensitive areas or where the normal noise level is low.

4.6.6 Performance Overlay District - Route 102 Corridor
4.6.6.1 Authority
The Section is enacted in pursuant to RSA 674:21, innovative land use controls, which provides the
statutory authority for the Town of Londonderry to provide intensity and use incentives, impact
zoning, performance standards, and the ability for the Planning Board to grant conditional use
permits. The Planning Board shall be solely responsible for the interpretation and administration of
this ordinance, including the granting of all conditional use permits relative thereto. Any decision
made by the Planning Board under this performance overlay district ordinance may be appealed
directly to superior court in the same manner provided by RSA 677:15.
4.6.6.2 Purpose and Intent - Route 102 Corridor
A. Because the Town of Londonderry has experienced an increase in development along the
Town's main traffic corridors and anticipates such growth will likely continue, (including the
widening of interstate 93 and the development of the Nashua-Hudson circumferential
highway), because said development will generate growth related impacts (increased traffic
congestion, infrastructure requirements, demand for public services, reduced aesthetics, etc.)
Utilizing the corridors, because traditional zoning techniques may not produce the type of
development envisioned by the community through the 1997 master plan, and in order to
implement the following objectives of the Town's 1997 master plan:
1. Guide the form of business development to occur in keeping with community objectives for
compatible, appropriate development;
2. Tune regulatory systems to encourage businesses or other high trip-generating uses to
more efficiently use the circulation system;
3. Regulating development to ensure that it can be supported by planned infrastructure,
taking into consideration that required infrastructure must be appropriate to the context
and must be supportive of environmental and community character concerns; and
4. Include consideration of impact upon natural and cultural resources in review of
development proposals
The Town hereby adopts this overlay district to guide the development of land through the
use of performance standards, incentives for quality development, and impact assessments
to ensure the desired development pattern along the major traffic corridors of
Londonderry.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 76
B. The purpose of the Route 102 Performance Overlay District is:
1. To minimize adverse traffic impacts on the corridors and surrounding local roadways;
2. To preserve the rural character of the district by providing for development that preserves
appropriate open space and builds upon the landscaping design, and visual character
standards of the Town's Site Plan Regulations;
3. To minimize negative impacts to the environment such as water quality, air quality,
prevention of noise pollution, light pollution, and to other important natural and cultural
resources.
4. To promote and attract high quality, diverse, and sustainable economic development to the
district by utilizing performance standards and flexibility in the district.
5. To protect the remaining aquifers within the Town of Londonderry.
6. To provide an appropriate mix of uses for the areas abutting the natural complex formed
by areas such as the Musquash Conservation Area, Kendall Pond area, Scobie Pond area,
the Litchfield State Forest, etc.
4.6.6.3 District Defined - Route 102 Corridor
A. The Route 102 Performance Overlay District shall be described as including the lots identified
on the “Performance Overlay Zone” Map and specifically as follows:

B. The term “overlay district” means a zoning district superimposed on one or more established
zoning districts to impose supplemental requirements, restrictions, and performance standards
on uses in the district.
4.6.6.4 Conflicts with Underlying Zoning Standards
Because of the unique nature of the performance based incentives and regulations in this overlay
district, the standards and requirements of this Section shall, unless otherwise stated in this section,
apply to all lots in the overlay district, regardless of the underlying zoning district, except:
A. Those zoned C-III at the time of passage of the POD by Town Council; and
B. Those lots with an underlying zone of AR-I and that have received a conditional use permit for
uses permitted in the AR-1 Zone
1. Such lots shall be subject to the standards of the AR-I District, (Section 9.2.1)
2. A buffer of fifty (50) feet shall be provided for any lot in a residential subdivision that abuts
land zoned for non-residential uses.
4.6.6.5 Uses Permitted
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 77
A. The Performance Overlay District allows for uses that are consistent with the purposes and
intent of the overlay district. Because not all uses permitted in the underlying zones are
consistent with the Performance Overlay, the uses permitted in the overlay district are limited
to those listed in subsection 4.6.6.5(C) below. The uses permitted in the underlying zoning
districts are not permitted, unless listed in subsection 4.6.6.5(C) below or considered a use
permitted by conditional use permit, see Section 4.6.6.6.
B. All uses permitted in the performance overlay district are subject to site plan review by the
Planning Board. Prior to Planning Board approval of a proposal, the applicant must
demonstrate, through the impact assessment requirements of Section 4.6.6.8, that the
proposal will meet all of the appropriate performance standards of Section 4.6.6.7, the Site
Plan Regulations, the subdivision regulations, as applicable, and shall be consistent with the
purpose and intent of the overlay district in Section 4.6.6.2.
C. The following uses are permitted within the performance overlay district:
1. Business center development: a tract of land, buildings or structures planned as a whole
and intended to include those uses allowed in this overlay district whether built at one time
as a unit or in two or more construction stages;
2. Professional offices including, but not limited to, dentists, doctors, lawyers, architects, real
estate, and such uses normally considered as general offices;
3. Restaurants, cafes, and similar establishments, with no drive-thru windows;
4. Retail stores or shops including clothing, appliance, hardware and department stores,
automotive accessory, drug and variety stores, grocery stores and supermarkets;
5. Computer services
6. Religious institutions/places of worship and related facilities;
7. Educational institutions;
8. Recreation areas (commercial and non-commercial);
9. Elderly housing & assisted living facilities, as outlined in Sections 10.3 and 10.4
4.6.6.6 Conditional Use Permits
All uses permitted by conditional use permit in the performance overlay district are subject to site
plan review by the Planning Board. Prior to Planning Board approval of a conditional use permit, the
applicant must demonstrate that it meets the general criteria for a Conditional Use Permit of Section
6.2, and the Specific Criteria of Section 6.3.X, Route 102 Performance Overlay District.
4.6.6.7 Performance Standards
A. Dimensional performance standards

Table 1 Footnotes:
(1) Lots with Frontage along both an arterial road and a local road shall be accessed from the local road whenever possible. The Planning Board
shall have the authority to allow access on an arterial road in such situations where access from the local road is deemed inappropriate or not
feasible, and the NHDOT has issued appropriate permits.
(2) Minimum frontage requirement must be satisfied from the road providing access to the lot.
(3) Subject to NHDES lot sizing criteria if DES minimum lot size is greater than 3 acres/1.5 acres.
(4) May be reduced to 2 times the building height if all parking is located to the side or rear of the principal structure.
(5) At no time shall the minimum front setback be less than 50 feet along an arterial road and 30 feet along a local Road.
(6) May be increased by an amount equal to the area of easement dedicated for future widening of the arterial road (See section 4.6.6.7(C) on
Incentive Bonuses)
(7) On lots with frontage on both an arterial and local road (double frontage), the front setback shall be measured from the property line
adjacent to the arterial road.
(8) No structure shall exceed three (3) stories of usable floor space
(9) As an incentive for use of steep roofs or other architectural elements (clock towers, cupolas, etc.) the Planning Board may, with
recommendation from the heritage Commission, allow for a height bonus not to exceed sixty (60) feet from grade. This additional height
beyond the maximum of forty five (45) feet is not used in the setback calculations.
B. Commercial Building Size Standards
1. Intent: because the intent of the performance overlay district is to preserve rural character
by providing for development that preserves appropriate open space and builds upon the
landscaping design, and visual character standards of the Town's Site Plan Regulations,
large scale commercial development is not consistent with the goal of the district. In order
to accomplish the goals of the district, the following performance standards are applied to
commercial buildings.
2. Multiple buildings are permitted on a single lot within the pod.
3. The size of any individual commercial building shall not exceed a building footprint of
12,500 square feet, but may be granted an incentive bonus to a building footprint not to
exceed 25,000 square feet if the all of the following criteria are met:
a. The proposed parking for the commercial use will be limited to the rear and side of the
structure.
b. The parking area for the building is interconnected with an adjoining lot, or provisions
are made to allow for connection of parking lots in the future.
c. The access for the building is shared with 1 or more other lots for access management
purposes.
C. Dimensional Incentive Bonus Standards
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 79
1. These incentive bonus standards are designed to reward projects that choose to voluntarily
develop their properties in a way that is most compatible with the stated goals and
objectives of this district and the master plan.
2. Reduction in minimum lot area and frontage: as an incentive to encourage the concept of
access management for traffic corridors through access on local roads and shared access
drives, the minimum lot area and frontage requirements shall be decreased as noted in
Table 3-8 where shared access or local road access is provided for a lot.
3. Widening easement deeds: those lots that voluntarily agree to provide easement deeds
over the portion of their land within 25 feet of the state right-of-way, thereby reserving this
easement area for future widening of the corridor or similar improvements within the
corridor, may be compensated for this action by being allowed an impervious surface
bonus, to develop their property to an extent greater than otherwise permitted in the
performance overlay district. The amount of extra impervious coverage shall be equal to
the actual computed area of the easement area provided for future improvements. The
provision of a widening easement may also qualify for credits to impact fees as outlined in
Section 1.2.
4. Reduction in minimum front setback: as an incentive to encourage the protection of
aesthetics in the performance overlay district, the minimum lot area and frontage
requirements shall be decreased as noted in footnote 4 of Table 3-8 of this Section where
parking is limited to the rear and/or side of the building.
D. Landscape Performance Standards
1. The landscape performance standards of the performance overlay district are intended to
supplement the requirements of the Site Plan Regulations, outlining areas where
landscaping are required in the district to promote the aesthetically pleasing type of
development desired by the community.
2. Specifics about landscaping materials, caliper sizes, and specifics of the design details shall
be as defined by Section 3.10 of the Site Plan Regulations. In the event that requirements of
this district and the Site Plan Regulations conflict, the more restrictive of the two
documents shall govern.
3. None of the landscape requirements contained in this ordinance or the Site Plan
Regulations shall be construed so as to require plantings where safe sight distance at
driveways or along public streets would be inhibited. The Planning Board may adjust
landscape requirements of this district when deemed necessary for reasons of public
safety.
4. Required Landscaping Areas
a. Open space: all areas disturbed by construction shall be covered with a minimum
thickness of 4 inches of suitable topsoil and be subsequently planted with grass seed,
sod, or other vegetative cover.
b. Street tree area
i. The street tree area shall be a 15 foot wide strip running parallel with the lot
frontage along any public right of way and shall be continuous along the entire
length of said right of way, except for those areas reserved for approved curb cuts.
(on lots where there is a widening easement provided, the street tree area shall
begin at the rear of the easement)
ii. The street tree area shall be planted with a minimum of 1 native shade tree (see
Site Plan Regulations for recommended native trees) for every 50 feet of right of
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 80
way frontage. The size of trees to be planted in this area shall be a minimum of 2
½ inch caliper at time of planting. Branching height of street trees shall not be less
than 7 feet above grade when planted. Street trees must not be closer than 25 feet
apart at time of planting.
iii. Incentive bonus: every healthy native tree with a caliper of 3 inches or greater,
which is preserved in the street tree area may be substituted for 1 required new
street tree planting.
c. Front Buffer Area
i. The front buffer area shall be a strip of variable width (minimum 20 feet wide)
between the street tree area and the closest point of a building or impervious
surface facing a public right of way. (on lots where there is a widening easement
provided, the street tree area may encroach and overlap the front buffer area)
ii. The front buffer area shall be planted with a minimum of 1 deciduous or evergreen
tree for every 30 feet of horizontal building facing a public right of way. Trees
planted in this area shall have a height equal to ½ the maximum proposed height
of a building (but not less than 12 feet from grade or greater than 30 feet from
grade) at time of planting.
iii. Incentive bonus: every healthy native tree with a caliper of 3 inches or greater,
which is preserved in the front buffer area may be substituted for 1 required new
front buffer tree planting. Every healthy native tree with a caliper of 4 inches or
greater, which is preserved in the front buffer area may be substituted for 2
required new front buffer tree plantings.
d. Side and Rear Buffer Areas
i. Required side and rear buffer areas shall begin at the inner limits of the front
buffer area and run parallel to the side and rear property lines. The minimum
width of these side and rear buffers shall equal to ½ the proposed maximum
building height, but not less than 10 feet wide. In the event the property abuts a
parcel zoned AR-I, the buffer shall be no less than 75 feet wide.
ii. The side and rear buffers shall be constructed to provide a dense 4 season visual
screen in accordance with Section 3.10 of the Site Plan Regulations.
iii. Perimeter parking lot landscaping and interior parking lot landscaping shall be in
accordance with Section 3.10 of the Site Plan Regulations.
iv. Signage landscaping
v. The signage landscaping area shall be a minimum 4 foot wide area surrounding

vii. Incentive bonus: healthy vegetation which is preserved in the location of signage
landscape area may be substituted for the required plantings.
e. Other screening: screening of storage areas, dumpster enclosures, loading docks,
receiving areas, above ground utility fixtures, and any other items deemed necessary
by the Planning Board, shall be in accordance with Section 3.10 of the Site Plan
Regulations.
E. Off-Street Parking
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 81
1. Intent: in order to provide safe and adequate parking facilities, yet maintain a high quality
aesthetic quality of development within the performance overlay district, performance
standards for parking have been developed.
2. The goals related to these performance standards are:
a. To ensure that appropriate parking areas are provided for future development within
the overlay district;
b. To promote the use of interconnected parking between adjacent businesses as a means
of access management along the corridor;
c. To encourage the provision of interior landscaping within parking lots as a means of
mitigating summer heat, snow storage areas, and improve the aesthetics of parking
areas.
3. General Performance Standards for Off-Street Parking.
a. The minimum number of parking spaces, dimensional requirements for parking stalls
and aisle widths shall be determined by the requirements of the underlying zoning
district (Section 3.09 of the Site Plan Regulations) except for parking lot setbacks
(also called green area setbacks as defined in Sections 4.4.1.3(H) and 4.3.2(B) which
are governed by the performance standards for landscaping, as outlined in Section
2.6.1.7(D).
b. Sales of automobiles or other items which may be for sale is not permitted within any
required parking spaces or their interconnecting drives and/or aisles.
c. Coordinated or joint parking design shall be provided wherever feasible in accordance
with Section 3.09 of the Site Plan Regulations. Abutting parcels shall be so designed as
to provide for mutually coordinated or joint parking access and circulation systems,
and shall include stub-outs and other design features as necessary to make it visually
obvious that the abutting properties may be tied in to create a unified system.
i. Development prior to abutting use. In the event that the site is developed prior to
an abutting property, it shall be designed to ensure that its parking, access and
circulation may be easily tied in to create a coordinated parking design at a later
date.
ii. Existing abutting uses. In the event that the site abuts an existing developed
property, it shall be so designed as to tie into the abutting parking, access and
circulation to create a coordinated system unless the Planning Board finds that
this would be impractical.
4. In parking lots where shared access and/or interconnected parking lots occur, the side and
rear landscape area requirements of 4.6.6.7(D) can be omitted.
F. Signage
1. General
a. The general standards of Section 7 shall apply to signs within the performance overlay

have been developed to protect the long-term environmental quality and vitality of
gateways to the Town of Londonderry and of sensitive natural resources in the vicinity
of the corridors.
b. In addition to the performance standards of this section, development within the
performance overlay district shall be subject to all applicable local, state, and federal
ordinances, regulations and laws. The standards listed in this Section shall not be
construed to imply relief from requirements of state or federal law.
2. General performance standards: all property within the performance overlay district shall
be subject to the standards outlined in Section 5.18.1 for vibration, noise, air pollution,
odors, glare & heat, harmful interference, and sewage/waste disposal performance
standards.

practices and the Londonderry Site Plan Regulations. Infiltration facilities shall be
designed to perform under all season conditions. Applicants are encouraged to meet
with the department of public works and engineering prior to developing a drainage
design to determine if infiltration is appropriate for a proposed site plan.
4. Performance Standards for Development of Steep Slopes
a. For purposes of this section, steep slope areas shall be defined as naturally existing,
contiguous areas of land of greater than ½ acre or more that have an average cross
slope gradient greater than 33% or 3h:1v.

4.6.6.8 Impact Assessment Requirements
A. The purpose of impact assessments within the performance overlay district is to provide the
Planning Board with sufficient information to conduct a detailed review of uses that have the
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 84
potential for significant impact within the overlay, and the Town as a whole. The impact review
process is intended to promote and protect the natural resources and aesthetic qualities of the
Town and to prevent or mitigate any adverse impact to the Town services, traffic patterns,
abutting properties, the economy of the Town, the character of the Town, or the public health,
safety, and welfare of Town residents.
B. Applicability and procedure

D. Review Standards for Impact Assessments
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 86
1. The Planning Board shall consider the standards included in Section 4.6.6.7 as well as the
other standards set forth in this ordinance and in the site plan and subdivision regulations
when reviewing development impacts assessments
4.6.6.9 Pre-Existing (Non-Conforming) Uses, Lots, and Structures
A. Notwithstanding other provisions of Section 4.6.6, the construction of additions and
expansions to pre-existing structures and uses shall be permitted within the pod, governed by
the standards of the underlying zoning district, provided that:
1. The use or structure lawfully existed prior to the adoption of the POD by the Town Council;
2. The proposed construction conforms to all other applicable ordinances and regulations of
the Town of Londonderry; and
3. The structure or use continues in its present use, and does not constitute a change of use.
B. Notwithstanding other provisions of Section 4.6.6, lots of less than 3 acres in size within the
POD shall be governed by the standards of the underlying zoning district, provided that:
1. The lot lawfully existed prior to the adoption of the POD by the Town Council; and
2. Any proposed construction conforms to all other applicable ordinances and regulations of
the Town of Londonderry.
4.6.7 Performance Overlay District - Route 28 Corridor
4.6.7.1 Authority
The Section is enacted in pursuant to RSA 674:21, innovative land use controls, which provides the
statutory authority for the Town of Londonderry to provide intensity and use incentives, impact
zoning, performance standards, and the ability for the Planning Board to grant conditional use
permits. The Planning Board shall be solely responsible for the interpretation and administration of
this ordinance, including the granting of all conditional use permits relative thereto. Any decision
made by the Planning Board under this performance overlay district ordinance may be appealed
directly to superior court in the same manner provided by RSA 677:15.
4.6.7.2 Purpose and Intent - Route 28 Corridor
A. Because the Town of Londonderry has experienced an increase in development along the
Town's main traffic corridors and anticipates such growth will likely continue, (including the
widening of Interstate 93, and industrial development south of the Manchester Airport),
because said development will generate growth related impacts (increased traffic congestion,
infrastructure requirements, demand for public services, reduced aesthetics, etc.) Utilizing the
corridors, because traditional zoning techniques may not produce the type of development
envisioned by the community through recent surveys and public outreach:
1. Guide the form of business development to occur in keeping with community objectives for
compatible, appropriate development;
2. Tune regulatory systems to encourage businesses to more efficiently use the circulation
system;
3. Regulating development to ensure that it can be supported by planned infrastructure,
taking into consideration that required infrastructure must be appropriate to the context
and must be supportive of environmental and community character concerns; and
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 87
4. Include consideration of impact upon natural and cultural resources in review of
development proposals
The Town hereby adopts this overlay district to guide the development of land through the
use of performance standards, incentives for quality development, and impact assessments
to ensure the desired development pattern along the major traffic corridors of
Londonderry.
B. The purpose of the Route 28 Performance Overlay District is:
1. To minimize adverse traffic impacts on the corridors and surrounding local roadways;
2. To promote and attract high quality, diverse, and sustainable economic development
within the district by utilizing performance standards and flexibility and providing for
development that preserves appropriate open space and builds upon the landscaping
design, and visual character standards of the Town's Site Plan Regulations;
3. To minimize negative impacts to the environment such as water quality, air quality,
prevention of noise pollution, light pollution, and to other important natural and cultural
resources.
4. To protect the remaining aquifers within the Town of Londonderry.
5. To provide an appropriate mix of uses for the areas abutting the natural complex formed
by areas such as the Musquash Conservation Area, Kendall Pond area, Scobie Pond area,
the Litchfield State Forest, etc.
4.6.7.3 District Defined – Route 28 Corridor
A. The performance overlay district shall be described as including the lots identified on the
“Performance Overlay Zone” Map and specifically as follows:
1. On Tax Map 15: 21, 21-1, 22, 22-1, 23, 23-1, 23-2, 25, 25-1, 26, 27, 28, 60-2, 60-2, 61, 61-
2, 61-4, 61-5, 61-7, 61-8, 63, 65-2, 66, 66-1, 67, 68, 69, 70-1, 70, 71, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128,

B. The term “overlay district” means a zoning district superimposed on one or more established
zoning districts to impose supplemental requirements, restrictions, and performance standards
on uses in the district.

(1) Lots with Frontage along both an arterial road and a local road shall be accessed from the local road whenever possible.
The Planning Board shall have the authority to allow access on an arterial road in such situations where access from the local road
is deemed inappropriate or not feasible, and the NHDOT has issued appropriate permits.
(2) Minimum frontage requirement must be satisfied from the road providing access to the lot.
(3) At no point shall the total usable floor area exceed 75,000 square feet.
(4) At no time shall the minimum front setback be less than 60 feet along an arterial road and 30 feet along a local Road.

develop their properties in a way that is most compatible with the stated goals and
objectives of this district and the master plan
2. Widening easement deeds: those lots that voluntarily agree to provide easement deeds
over the portion of their land within 25 feet of the state right-of-way, thereby reserving this
easement area for future widening of the corridor or similar improvements within the
corridor, may be compensated for this action by being allowed an impervious surface
bonus, to develop their property to an extent greater than otherwise permitted in the
performance overlay district. The amount of extra impervious coverage shall be equal to
the actual computed area of the easement area provided for future improvements. The
provision of a widening easement may also qualify for credits to impact fees as outlined in
Section 1.2.
C. Building setbacks for POD lots located on NH Route 28
1. Front setbacks for lots located along NH Route 28 shall be based on the following
performance standards:
a. Building footprint of 0 - 10,000 square feet: 60 feet

2. Side setbacks for lots located along Rt. 28 shall be one-half (½) the front setback.
3. Rear setbacks for lots located along Rt. 28 shall be one-third (1/3) the front setback, but
not less than 30 feet.
D. Landscape Performance Standards - landscape performance standards shall be the same as
Section 4.6.6.7(D), with the following exceptions:
1. Front Buffer Area
a. The front buffer area shall be a strip of variable width (minimum 40 feet wide)
between the street tree area and the closest point of a building or impervious surface
facing a public right of way. (on lots where there is a widening easement provided, the
street tree area may encroach and overlap the front buffer area)
b. The front buffer area shall be planted with a minimum of 2 trees for every 30 feet of
horizontal building facing a public right of way. Trees planted in this area shall have a
height equal to ½ the maximum proposed height of a building (but not less than 12
feet from grade or greater than 30 feet from grade) at time of planting.
c. Incentive bonus: every healthy native tree with a caliper of 4 inches or greater, which
is preserved in the front buffer area may be substituted for 1 required new front buffer

5 SUPPLEMENTARY REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS
5.1Residential Development Phasing
5.1.1 Authority
Pursuant to the provisions of NH RSA 674:21, the Town of Londonderry adopts the following phasing
standards for residential development, to be administered by the Planning Board in conjunction with
the Londonderry Subdivision Regulations.
5.1.2 Purpose
The purpose of this Section is as follows:
A. To guide efforts by the Town to monitor, evaluate, plan for and guide residential growth in
Londonderry that is consistent with the Town’s capacity for planned, orderly and sensible
expansion of its services to accommodate such development without establishing absolute
limits on the overall growth rate of the community;
B. To provide for the current and future housing need of existing residents and their families;
C. To phase in or control the implementation and development of tracts of land and future
subdivisions thereon, at a rate which will be compatible with the orderly and gradual expansion
of community services, including but not limited to education, fire protection, road
maintenance, waste disposal, police protection and recreation; and
D. To provide a mechanism to allow for phased development of residential projects to manage the
impact on municipal services.
5.1.3 Phasing of Development
A phasing plan shall be submitted for Planning Board approval for all residential developments of
more than fifteen (15) lots or dwelling units (unless exempted under Section 5.1.4), and at the
Applicant’s option may be submitted for smaller developments. Such plans shall comply with the
following phasing requirements:
A. For development proposed under the provisions of Section 5.3, Conservation Subdivisions:
twenty-five (25) dwelling units per year from the date of final approval;
B. For development located within the R-III district: three (3) multi-family buildings, the total
number of dwelling units not to exceed forty eight (48) per year from the date of final approval.
C. In the event that the Planning Board grants a conditional use permit to allow more than 16 units
per building in the R-III District, such developments shall be permitted two (2) multi-family
buildings, the total number of dwelling units not to exceed forty (40) permits per year from the
date of final approval.
D. For multi-family development meeting the definition of “workforce housing” as defined by RSA
674:58, and approved by the Planning Board per the procedures outlined in RSA 674:60: the
total number of dwelling units shall not exceed seventy-two (72) per year from the date of final
approval.
E. For single family development approved under the requirements of “Inclusionary Housing”:
twenty-five (25) dwelling units per year from the date of final approval.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 91
F. For other residential development proposed to be serviced with public water and public sewer,
and proposing no dwelling structures within 200 feet of a street other than one created by that
development: twenty (20) dwelling units per year from the date of final approval.
G. For all other residential development: fifteen (15) dwelling units per year from the date of final
approval.
5.1.4 Exemptions from Phasing
The Planning Board shall grant exemption to the phasing requirements of Section 5.1.3 under the
following condition:
The proposed project is for Elderly Housing in accordance with Section 5.6 and the owner of record
shall enter an agreement, to be filed in the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds, certifying that the
project will be utilized and restricted to 100% elderly occupants (age 55 and older).
5.2 Planned Unit Development
5.2.1 Authority
The Section is enacted in pursuant to RSA 674:21, innovative land use controls, which provides the
statutory authority for the Town of Londonderry to allow for the development of a Planned Unit
Development ordinance.
5.2.2 Purpose
A. A Planned Unit Development (PUD) allows a landowner to propose his/her own development
project largely independent from current land use regulations otherwise applicable to that
property. A PUD master plan is akin to a special zoning district designation for a particular tract
of land in terms of uses, dimensions, and other development standards. (Note: every reference
to a master plan in this PUD ordinance refers to the PUD Master Plan rather than the Town of
Londonderry Master Plan, except where the latter is specifically referred to as such.)
B. The purpose of this ordinance is to promote flexibility in large scale development by
considering project proposals based upon a comprehensive, integrated and detailed plan rather
than the specific constraints applicable to piecemeal lot-by-lot development under
conventional zoning. A PUD should improve the quality of new development by encouraging
aesthetically attractive features and promoting quality site and architectural design. The
Planning Board will use the 2004 Londonderry Master Plan and/or successor plans, 2009
Londonderry Small Area Master Plan and/or successor plans, 2003 Londonderry Design
Charrette and/or successor plans (if applicable) and any other long range planning document
as guidance in the land use development aspect of the PUD master planning process.
5.2.3 Process
The process for administering a Planned Unit Development is as follows:
A. Due to the complexity inherent in PUD's, prior to developing a detailed PUD proposal or
submitting an application applicants are strongly encouraged to:
1. Meet with the Community Development Department to discuss their ideas; and
2. Hold a conceptual discussion with the Planning Board.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 92
B. The applicant submits a formal PUD application (also known as the proposed PUD master plan)
as specified elsewhere in this section.
C. The Planning Board holds a public hearing on the PUD application and determines whether or
not it is complete, in accordance with this ordinance. The board must take final action on the
application within 65 days of a finding of completeness.
D. The Planning Board approves, denies, or approves with conditions the PUD application. An
applicant may appeal any such decision of the Planning Board in the same manner specified for
appeals for site plan determinations and subdivision determinations (RSA 677:15).
E. The Community Development Department maintains a record of all approved PUD master
plans. The PUD is demarcated on the Zoning Map of the Town (over the underlying zoning
district) and labeled based on the order in which the master plan was approved (as PUD-1, PUD-
2, etc.).
F. Subsequent to the PUD approval, the applicant submits a separate site plan application and/or
subdivision application for development of the tract in accordance with the master plan. In the
event of a conflict between the terms of the approved master plan and the terms of the site plan
regulations or subdivision regulations, the terms of the approved master plan shall control.
G. Any development on the subject property must be consistent with the approved master plan as
determined by the Planning Board. While it is the master plan, rather than the underlying
zoning district, that regulates development of the subject tract, there shall remain an underlying
zoning designation for the tract at all times.
H. In the event active and substantial development or building has not begun on the site by the
owner or the owner's successor-in-interest in accordance with the approved master plan within
four years after the date of approval, or in accordance with other specific terms of the approval,
then the master plan shall be deemed to have expired and the underlying zoning shall then
control development of the land. Landowners may apply to the Planning Board for extensions
of this time period for good cause shown.
I. Landowners may apply to amend all or a portion of an approved PUD following the same
process applicable to the establishment of a PUD. A landowner may extinguish a PUD by
notifying the Planning Board in writing that he/she does not intend to utilize the PUD.
5.2.4 PUD Master Plan
A. In devising the PUD master plan, subject to specific limitations, guidelines, and objectives stated
elsewhere in this ordinance, there is flexibility in the selection of land uses, density, setbacks,
buffers, building heights, lot sizes, lot dimensions, parking requirements, and most site design
and development standards contained in the Zoning Ordinance, Site Plan Regulations,
Subdivision Regulations.
B. The master plan is composed of all of the elements submitted by the applicant which describe
the project including:
1. A land use plan (drawing),
2. Land use list,
3. PUD application,
4. Narrative,
5. Architectural guidelines (if applicable),
6. Any other development guidelines
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 93
7. Any additions, deletions, modifications, and/or clarifications stipulated by the Planning
Board in its approval.
C. The land plan delineates one or more land use areas. An accompanying land use list gives a
designation for each land use area specifying approximate acreage, types of uses, density and
any other development standards peculiar to that area.
5.2.5 Basic Requirements
The following requirements apply:
A. Location. PUD's are permitted in any zoning district on one or more lots, or portions of lots, of
land provided they meet all other criteria outlined in this Section.
B. Tract size. The minimum area required for a PUD shall be one hundred (100) contiguous acres
of land. Where portions of the tract are separated by a road, road right-of-way, utility, waterway,
or another like element, the land shall be deemed contiguous unless the intervening feature is
of such a nature that the Planning Board determines that the land could not function effectively
as a PUD.
1. A PUD may include land which has been previously developed under the requirements of
the underlying zoning only when, as part of the PUD Master Plan, the previously developed
portion of land is substantially redeveloped in a manner which is consistent with the spirit
of the PUD ordinance and which proposes improvements to such items as the aesthetics,
architectural design, connectivity with the undeveloped part of the PUD and which creates
a unified concept and design for the entire parcel.
C. Ownership. The PUD shall either be under unified ownership or be a collection of lots under
separate ownership with a development agreement stipulating all owners are subject to the
requirements of any PUD Master Plan approval by the Planning Board at the time of application.
However, the tract may be subsequently subdivided consistent with the terms and conditions
of the approved master plan. Multiple parties may own, manage, and/or develop various
components of the PUD provided that the overall PUD remains integrated.
D. Water and Sewer. Only those tracts which contain buildings that will be serviced by water
(Manchester Water Works, Derry Municipal Water, or Pennichuck Water) and municipal sewer
systems (and determined to be reasonably consistent with the Town’s Sewer Facilities Master
Plan as determined by the Planning Board) are permitted to be included in a PUD.
5.2.6 Permitted Uses
A. The uses listed in the PUD column of the Table of Uses (Section 4.1) may be proposed for
inclusion in a PUD. However, no use is permitted in a PUD unless specifically approved by the
Planning Board as part of the PUD Master Plan.
1. Due to the unique characteristics of the Gateway Business District, Residential uses
otherwise permitted in a PUD shall not be permitted in a PUD Master Plan for any lot with
Gateway Business District as the underlying zoning district.
B. Any uses that are permitted in the underlying zoning district, either by right, special exception
or conditional use permit (at such time as this procedure may be established) shall be
considered permitted uses in a PUD.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 94
5.2.7 Standards of Development
The following standards shall apply to all PUD’s:
A. Off street parking and loading shall comply with Section 3.09 of the Site Plan Regulations for
each proposed use. However, the Planning Board may grant waivers for parking if the Board
finds that waivers will be compatible with the design and purposes of the PUD.
B. Except for structures not intended for human occupancy (chimney, water tower, etc.) height of
buildings shall not exceed 50 feet, or as specified by the Federal Aviation Administration as part
of their permitting process or by the limitations outlined in the Airport Approach Height
Overlay (Section 3.7.4).
C. In PUD’s where residential uses are proposed, the overall residential density of a PUD may not
exceed six (6) residential dwelling units (including single family homes) per gross acre of the
PUD tract. In determining appropriate density, in addition to other criteria here, the Planning
Board shall pay special attention to the amount of buildable land contained on the tract as
determined or reasonably estimated in the submission materials. Permitted non-residential
uses may be located in a flexible spatial environment, assuring compatibility with residential
uses and with the overall development design.
D. The PUD shall be in compliance with:
1. All standards contained within the Zoning Ordinance, Site Plan Regulations, and
Subdivision Regulations unless waived or modified as part of the master plan; and
2. All applicable local, state, and federal law relating to public health and safety, building
construction, and drainage (these standards may not be waived or modified).
E. All roads and structures shall be set back a minimum of fifty (50) feet from all exterior PUD tract
boundaries which abut residential uses except where transportation or use linkages are
desired. Landscaping and other screening devices shall be designed to provide a reasonable
buffer between the PUD and adjoining property except where compatible uses adjoin one
another.
F. Any proposed covenants, restrictions, and easements must be approved by the Planning Board.
A provision must be built into the documents providing for municipal enforcement of the
covenants, restrictions, and easements at the Town’s option and at the developer's expense
under appropriate circumstances.
G. In a PUD where ownership is subject to restrictions, covenants and other agreements, those
documents shall be recorded in the Rockingham County Registry of Deeds.
5.2.8 Criteria for Review of PUD Proposals
The following criteria shall guide the Planning Board in determining appropriate land uses, densities,
and other development standards for the PUD. It is emphasized that the determination of whether or
not a proposal meets the intent and objectives of this ordinance is made by the Planning Board in its
reasonable discretion.

circulation signage. Specific criteria for design, size, proposed sign types (wall, free
standing, etc.), materials, heights, colors, set-backs, projections and contextual issues shall
be established. Any other sign design information as required by the Town shall also be
provided.
20. Proposed time schedule for completion of the project, phasing schedule (if applicable
depending on scale and type of PUD), plans for bonding if applicable, and well thought out
plan to ensure that the amenities will be completed as proposed and in a timely manner.
21. Proposed covenants, restrictions and easements and how they will be monitored and
enforced, if applicable.

25. Any other information that the Planning Board or the Town Attorney may deem reasonably
necessary.
5.2.10 Interpretation/application of PUD master plan
The Planning Board shall review any site plan or subdivision application for its conformity with the
approved PUD master plan; however the PUD will have control over site review and subdivision
regulations. The Board may use its discretion in determining if particular items are consistent with
the intent of the plan.
A. Many items in the PUD Master Plan will be presented and construed to be in preliminary sketch
form subject to preparation of detailed, engineering analysis and some modification at the site
plan/subdivision application stage consistent with the master plan. These items include exact
lot locations and layouts, exact locations of roads aid paths, size and configuration of parking
lots, utility information, water and sewer/septic, drainage, landscaping, and architectural
renderings. (For example, the land plan may show numerous trees to be planted. The applicant
would be able to significantly modify the locations and types of planting at the site plan stage
provided the intent of the landscaping element as presented in the land plan is met.)
B. All development standards must ultimately be determinable for each land use area. Where
specific development standards are neither stated nor implied in the PUD master plan, the most
appropriate standards otherwise applicable (from the Zoning Ordinance, Site Plan Regulations,
and/or Subdivision Regulations) shall apply as determined by the Planning Board. (For
example, an area designated for a particular use in the PUD master plan does not specify front
setbacks. The front setbacks contained in the appropriate underlying zoning district would then
apply.)
5.2.11 Fees
The application fees for a PUD are as follows:
A. $20.00 per gross acre of the tract not to exceed $5,000
B. Legal notice and abutter notification fees shall be as determined in the latest version of the
Town’s Subdivision and Site Plan Regulations.
5.3 Conservation Subdivisions
5.3.1 Purposes
A Conservation Subdivision represents a form of residential development where, instead of
subdividing an entire tract of land into lots of conventional size and arrangement, a similar number
of lots can be arranged on the land in a more innovative fashion which better fits the topography and
natural attributes of the site. The remaining land in the tract that has not been built upon shall be set
aside for open space or integrated among the housing units and reserved for usable common open
space. This open space designation shall be held in a form of ownership that will prevent it from being
further subdivided or developed.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 98
The purpose for establishing this section is to promote a development pattern that creates areas of
useable and accessible open space, provides land for open space, prevents disruption of natural
topography and drainage systems, maintains the rural and open character of the undeveloped area
of the Town; protects historically significant buildings, resources, and/or landscapes; protects
valuable wildlife areas; allows for attractive site design; encourages a more environmentally practical
utility and street network; and assists the Town in the goals of protecting open space and providing
housing alternatives as outlined in the Master Plan.
5.3.2 Objectives
A. To provide a residential zoning district that permits flexibility of design in order to promote
environmentally sensitive and efficient uses of land.
B. To preserve in perpetuity unique or sensitive natural resources such as groundwater,
floodplains, wetlands, streams, steep slopes, woodlands, and wildlife habitat
C. To permit clustering of houses and structures on less environmentally sensitive soils, which will
reduce the amount of infrastructure, including paved surfaces and utility easements, necessary
for residential development.
D. To reduce soil erosion and sedimentation by minimizing land disturbance and removal of
vegetation in residential development.
E. To encourage interconnected greenways and corridors throughout the community.
F. To encourage contiguous green space with adjacent jurisdictions.
G. To encourage interaction in the community by clustering houses and orienting them closer to
the street, providing public gathering places and encouraging use of parks and community
facilities as focal points in the neighborhood.
H. To encourage street design that reduces traffic speeds and reliance on main arteries.
I. To encourage construction of convenient landscaped walking trails and bike paths both within
the subdivision and connected to neighboring communities, businesses, and facilities to reduce
reliance on automobiles.
J. To conserve scenic views and reduce perceived density by maximizing the number of houses
with direct access to and views of open space.
K. To protect prime agricultural land and preserve farming as an economic activity.
L. To preserve important historic and archaeological sites.
5.3.3 General Regulations
A. Applications of Regulations. This Conservation Subdivision option is available as a use by
right in the AR-I Zoning District. The Applicants shall comply with all other provisions of the
zoning ordinance and all other applicable regulations, except those that are incompatible with
the provisions contained herein.
1. Lots of greater than 20 acres in the AR-I Zone that are located closer than 100 feet to a
parcel already protected by the Town of Londonderry by easement or ownership for Open
Space purposes, and which require the construction of a new roadway to access newly
subdivided lots, shall be required to utilize the Conservation Subdivision requirements of
this section for any subdivision of the land for housing development.
B. Housing Density Determination. The maximum number of lots in the Conservation
Subdivision shall be determined by either of the following methods, at the discretion of the
applicant:
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 99
1. Calculation Method: the maximum number of lots is determined by dividing the area of the
tract of land by the minimum lot size specified in the underlying zoning.
2. Where public sewer is not available, the maximum density for a Conservation Subdivision
using the calculation method will be established by using Table 3-3 of Section 3.3 of this
ordinance, and computing a total soil carrying capacity of all allowed soils found in the
parcel proposed for subdivision. The soil carrying capacity of any soil is to be calculated by
dividing the given area of any soil type by the required area for that soil type found in Table
3-3. The resulting number shall be multiplied by 85 percent to obtain the maximum
number of dwelling lots permitted in the Conservation Subdivision.
3. Where public sewer is available, the maximum density will be established by using Table
3-2 of Section 3.3 of this ordinance, divided by the total area of the entire parcel to be
subdivided.
4. In using the Calculation Method for determining the maximum number of lots, the
following shall not be included in the total area of the parcel:
a. Slopes over 25% of at least 5000 square feet contiguous area;
b. The 100-year floodplain;
c. Drainage Easements; and
d. Wetlands that meet the definition of this ordinance.
5. Yield Plan Method: The maximum number of lots is based on a conventional subdivision
design plan, prepared by the applicant, in which the tract of land is subdivided in a manner
intended to yield the highest number of lots possible. The plan does not have to meet formal
requirements for a site design plan, but the design must be capable of being constructed
given site feature and all applicable regulations
C. Lot Area and Shape.
1. The minimum lot size (prior to subdivision) for a Conservation Subdivision is 20 acres in
common beneficial ownership. The minimum frontage for the development shall be a
contiguous 100 feet and of sufficient length to provide safe access for a right-of-way of at
least 50 feet.
2. Minimum Lot Size
a. For lots connected to public or community water and sewer: The minimum lot size in
a Conservation Subdivision shall be one half (½) acre in size.
b. For lots connected to public or community sewer, but utilizing an onsite well for water
service: The minimum lot size in a Conservation Subdivision shall be one half (½) acre
in size.
c. For lots connected to public or community water, but utilizing an onsite septic system:
The minimum lot size in a Conservation Subdivision shall be one half (½) of the total
calculated minimum lot size using Table 3-3 of Section 3.3 of this ordinance or ½ acre,
whichever is greater.
d. For lots serviced by an onsite well and an onsite septic system: The minimum lot size
in a Conservation Subdivision shall be the total calculated minimum lot size using
Table 3-3 of Section 3.3 of this ordinance or 1 acre, whichever is greater.
3. Frontage: Every building lot in the Conservation Subdivision shall have a minimum
frontage of fifty (50) feet along a street providing access exclusively to the Conservation
Subdivision and situated entirely within the Conservation Subdivision.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 100
D. Setbacks.
1. Setbacks from exterior property lines of the entire development parcel (the lot as it existed
prior to subdivision) shall be 25 feet.
2. Minimum Setback for Structures from Property Lines:
a. Front 30 feet
b. Side 15 feet
c. Back 15 feet
5.3.4 Density Bonus Criteria
All density bonuses are subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit from the Planning Board and
each bonus is computed on the base density as defined in Section 5.3.3(C) above. (For example, if a
Conservation Subdivision was approved for 100 units and had two density bonuses of 10% each, the
total authorized units would be 120, not 100 x 1.1 x 1.1 = 121.)
A. Where the proposed Conservation Subdivision plan shows 50% or more of the total parcel as
open space protected as such in perpetuity, the development may be awarded a density bonus
of 10%.
B. Public Access Bonus- Where the public is granted access to the open space or a small (5 spaces
or less) off-street gravel parking area for people to access open space is provided, the
development may be awarded a density bonus of 5%. The intent of the bonus is permit
pedestrian use, the Planning Board, may reasonably restrict the use of motorized vehicles.
C. Agricultural Lands and Use Bonus- Where the development protects agriculturally valuable
lands and provides for their use as such in perpetuity, the development may be awarded a
density bonus of up to 10%. The Planning Board shall, on a case-by-case basis, determine the
bonus percentage by considering the size of the project, the quality of the soils, and the number
of acres of farmland preserved. The open space portion preserved for agricultural use must be
at least three and one-half (3.5) contiguous acres and must be reasonably accessible. To receive
the maximum bonus it must either have been historically farmed, or contain prime, statewide
or locally significant agricultural soils, as shown on NRCS soil maps
D. Additional Protection Bonus - Where the development is able to protect unique
characteristics, including the following, it may be awarded a total density bonus under this
Section of up to 10%, in the sole discretion of the Planning Board. The development must
provide for the protection of these resources in perpetuity and trail corridor protection must
allow for reasonable public access:
1. Viewsheds, which are lands or corridors of land that contribute to the visual landscape of
the town, including items such as open fields containing stonewalls, mature forests, visible
water bodies and their buffers.
2. Historically significant buildings and landscapes identified by the Heritage/Historic
District Commission.
3. Valuable wildlife habitat and exemplary natural communities confirmed by the
Conservation Commission.
4. Linking open space parcels or trail corridors through the site with existing trails or open
space networks located off the subject parcel.
5. Including land identified as part of the Londonderry Open Space Plan.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 101
E. Bonus Multiplier for projects using Development Yield Method. The yield for residential
Conservation Subdivision development shall be determined by total bedrooms and shall not
exceed the following:
1. 4 bedroom units= (yield plan + bonuses) /1.00
2. 3 bedroom units= (yield plan + bonuses) / 0.85
3. 1 & 2 bedroom units= (yield plan + bonuses) /0.65
F. Density Bonus Cap: No Conservation Subdivision shall be granted bonuses totaling greater
than 20% when combined.
5.3.5 Open Space

Roads in Conservation Subdivisions shall be designed to the appropriate road design criteria found
in the Subdivision Regulations, as most recently amended.
5.4 Back Lot Development
5.4.1 Purpose
The purpose of Back Lot Development is to allow a landowner to develop areas of his/her property
without any road frontage in exchange for permanently prohibiting development of roadside areas
identified by the community as contributing to Londonderry’s character, such as land that is being
actively farmed. The purpose is also to protect open space, to maintain a viable contribution to the
community’s economic base through agricultural employment and gross regional product, and to
product roadside land which will preserve the rural historic character of the community. The
Planning Board is authorized to utilize a Conditional Use Permit in accordance with the provisions of
RSA 674:21, innovative zoning.
The Planning Board finds:
A. Back lot development is consistent with the Natural Resource Objective 4 of the 1988 Master
Plan “To purchase or otherwise protect selected open space areas for community needs.”
B. Back lot development is consistent with the Historic Preservation Objective 2 of the 1988
Master Plan “to encourage the use of easements and covenants to insure that the essential
qualities of specific buildings or sites remains intact.
C. Back lot development is consistent with the Agricultural Goal and Objective of the 1988 Master
Plan “To encourage the continued use of land in Town for farming” and “to encourage the
preservation of Londonderry’s agricultural atmosphere”.
D. Agriculture is an important component of Londonderry’s community character.
E. The retention of stonewalls and open space viewed from our roads enhances the community’s
rural and agrarian character.
F. The Londonderry Master Plan 1988, et seq., and the Orchard and Open Space Protection Plan,
1996, shall be used as a guide in determining which properties reflect this character.
5.4.2 General Requirements
A. The back lot development shall be subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit by the
Planning Board in accordance with Section 6 of this Ordinance generally, and Section 6.3.5
specifically, and shall be subject to approval by the Planning Board under the Londonderry
Subdivision Regulations. It is strongly recommended that the applicant schedule a discussion
with the Planning Board as early in the process as possible.
B. The applicant shall place a permanent agricultural preservation restriction or conservation
easement over a minimum of two (2) acres of roadside land (to be known as the FRONT LOT)
with at least 150' of frontage on a Class V or better street and contiguous to each back lost
created.
C. Setbacks shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from each property line
D. Minimum back lot area shall not be less than one half (l/2) an acre. In addition, the back lot,
together with the contiguous to acre restricted area assigned to it, shall satisfy the total soil
carrying capacity as computed using Minimum Lot Size by Soil Type requirements specified in
Section 3.3.
Zoning Ordinance, Town of Londonderry, NH – 12/9/2019 Page 106

applicant will notify the building inspector by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of
abandonment or discontinuation of operations.
B. Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner shall physically remove the small wind
energy system within 90 days from the date of abandonment or discontinuation of use. This
period may be extended at the request of the owner and at the discretion of the building
inspector. “Physically remove” shall include, but not be limited to:
1. Removal of the wind generator and tower and related above-grade structures.
2. Restoration of the location of the small wind energy system to its natural condition, except
that any landscaping, grading or below-grade foundation may remain in its same condition

or discontinued if the system is out-of-service for a continuous 12-month period. After the 12
months of inoperability, the building inspector may issue a Notice of Abandonment to the owner
of the small wind energy system. The owner shall have the right to respond to the Notice of
Abandonment within 30 days from Notice receipt date. After review of the information
provided by the owner, the building inspector shall determine if the small wind energy system
has been abandoned. If it is determined that the small wind energy system has not been
abandoned, the building inspector shall withdraw the Notice of Abandonment and notify the
owner of the withdrawal.
D. If the owner fails to respond to the Notice of Abandonment or if, after review by the building
inspector, it is determined that the small wind energy system has been abandoned or
discontinued, the owner of the small wind energy system shall remove the wind generator and
tower at the owner’s sole expense within 3 months of receipt of the Notice of Abandonment. If
the owner fails to physically remove the small wind energy system after the Notice of
Abandonment procedure, the building inspector may pursue legal action to have the small wind
energy system removed at the owner’s expense.

parking, cross access agreements over interconnected sites, and mixed-use development
wherever practical in accordance with the Master Plan.
C. Ensure that any parking facility is so designed to provide proper circulation, reduce hazards to
pedestrians, and protect the users of adjoining properties from nuisance caused by the noise,
fumes, and glare of headlights which may result from the operation of vehicles parking off the
street;
D. Reduce congestion in the streets and contribute to traffic safety.

building, wall or window, without any distinguishing border, panel or background, the area
shall be considered to be the smallest rectangle, triangle, or circle encompassing all the
letters and symbols.

the purpose of this section, the permitted background area is the total area between the
lintel bar and the parapet on a one (1) story building or between the lintel bar and the floor
level of the floor above on a multi-story building
C. Sign Height

grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be
construed to be the lower of the following: (1) The existing grades of the lot before
construction, or (2) The newly established grade of the lot after construction inclusive of
any filling, berming, mounding, or excavating solely for the purpose of locating the sign.

When an application for a demolition permit, or a building permit involving a demolition, or a site

the applicant that a sign identifying the building as proposed for demolition and the date, time,
and place of the public hearing on the proposed demolition is ready for posting in a visible
location on the building. Posting of the sign within 5 business days of receiving notification from

hearing that the demolition can proceed if the building is found not to be significant.
G. Hold a meeting between the Demolition Review Committee and the applicant (or applicant's
agent) within 10 business days of the public hearing to discuss alternatives to demolition if the
committee determines the building is significant and its loss potentially detrimental to the
community.
9.3.5 Demolition
A. If no alternatives to demolition have been identified and agreed to by the applicant, after the
meeting provided in Section 9.3.4(G), the applicant is free to proceed with demolition. Prior to
demolition, and if the applicant is in agreement, the Demolition Review committee shall

Page 32 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
7. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided on the same lot as the principal use they are intended
to serve. In no case shall an off-street loading space be counted as part of an area to satisfy the
off-street parking requirements.
8. No loading bay area abutting a residential zoning district shall be located within fifty (50) feet of
the residential boundary line. Loading bays shall not be located on sides of buildings facing a
public right-of-way except as specifically approved by the Planning Board. Where such request
is granted, the Board shall require an opaque wall, fence, natural terrain, vegetation or other
solution to provide screening as effectively as possible.
9. The area approved for loading or unloading shall not obstruct access to a property or right-ofway.
All loading spaces shall have direct access to a public right-of-way.

12. Loading bays shall not be located on sides of buildings facing a public right-of-way, except as
specifically approved by the Planning Board. Where such exception is granted, the Board shall
require an opaque wall, fence, natural terrain, vegetation or other solution to provide screening as
effectively as practical.
h. Coordinated or Joint Parking Design:
1. When feasible, abutting parcels may be so designed as to provide for mutually coordinated or
joint parking, access and circulation systems, and shall include stub-outs and other design
features as necessary to make it visually obvious that the abutting properties are tied together in a
unified traffic system.
2. In parking lots where shared access and/or interconnected parking lots occur, perimeter parking
lot shade tree requirements of Section 3.10.g of the Site Plan Regulations may be relieved by the
Planning Board where parking is located to the side or rear of the building.
3. Development prior to abutting use. In the event that the site is developed prior to an abutting
property, it shall be designed to ensure that its parking, access and circulation may be easily tied
in to create a coordinated parking design at a later date.
4. Existing abutting uses. In the event that the site abuts an existing developed property, it shall be
so designed as to tie into the abutting parking, access and circulation to create a coordinated
system unless the Planning Board finds that this would be impractical.
i. Flexibility in Off-Street Parking and Loading Standards:
1. Flexibility in Administration Required
Page 33 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
i. The Planning Board has flexibility in the administration of the requirements of Section
3.09 and TABLE B, and may allow more or less parking when the Applicant has
reasonably demonstrated that the need exists as measured by the following criteria.
ii. The parking calculation for flex-spaces in a development intended to provide
opportunities for a variety of uses over time should plan for the most intense possible use,
e.g. restaurant vs. specialty retail, or stipulate that future uses shall not cause the parking
requirement to exceed the available spaces.
2. Flexibility in the Number of Required Off-Street Parking Spaces
i. The Planning Board may be flexible in the administration of parking requirements set
forth in Section 3.09 of the Site Plan Regulations when it finds that at least one of the
following criteria is met, and such deviations are consistent with the purpose and intent of
the Zoning Ordinance and Site Plan Regulations:
a) The Applicant is able to demonstrate through studies of similar uses or similar
facilities that the actual parking demand for the property is significantly different
from the requirements of Section 3.09, and can document that there have been no
parking shortages at such studied sites.
b) The Applicant is requesting a permanent shared parking arrangement for a multitenant
site, a mixed-use development, or a shared parking agreement with an
adjacent property.
c) Alternate transportation modes are available to be implemented, and the
Applicant has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that the
business or business center and its employees will utilize such alternative modes
of transportation.
d) A residential development is irrevocably oriented toward the elderly or other
demographic group that, due to the driving characteristics of the group, requires
fewer or more parking stalls than the general populace.
ii. Whenever the Planning Board grants an alternative from the parking requirements listed
in Section 3.09, the Applicant shall note the alternate parking requirements approved by
the Planning Board on the Site Plan.
j. Alternative Parking Standards:
In order to encourage alternate modes of travel that will reduce dependence upon the singleoccupancy
automobile, the following guidelines and standards are offered:
1. Compact Auto Spaces: In parking lots containing one hundred (100) or more spaces serving a
nonresidential principal use, the Planning Board may permit the designation of compact
automobile spaces to a proportion of not greater than ten (10) percent of the total which may be
designed in accordance with Section 3.09.c.2.i.
2. Shared Parking: Where the Planning Board determines that a proposed development consisting
of two or more uses located on a single parcel will generate different hourly, daily and/or
seasonal parking demand due to the varied hours of operation of each use and frequencies of
customer and employee occupancy of available parking spaces, the Planning Board may approve
a site plan utilizing shared parking. The Applicant shall provide the parking space count and
Page 34 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
justification analysis. Approved shared parking requires the present construction of a lesser
number of spaces. The Planning Board may approve an alternate parking requirement in
accordance with the following:
i. The Applicant submits a shared parking computation to the Planning Board which shall
be based upon the following:
a. A complete and accurate description of the proposed uses, floor areas devoted to
such uses, the number of seats or rooms assigned to each use, and the days and
hours of operation of each use for each day of the week and for any seasonal
variations in operations.
b. A complete and accurate description of the number of employees and their
respective shifts, if applicable.
c. To calculate optimal parking requirements based on an estimated peak operating
time for mixed-use developments, commercial centers, and sites with multiple
users, start by computing the parking required for each use separately utilizing
the parking requirements in TABLE B. The computation should set
predetermined time periods over the course of 24 hours, for both weekdays and
weekends, (e.g. 11:00 p.m. to 6:00 a.m., 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., 9:00 a.m. to
6:00 p.m., and 6:00 p.m. to 11:00 p.m.) The first calculation assigns the
percentage of total users for each time period. The second calculation assigns the
parking requirement for each use to determine how many parking spaces are
required for each time period. The result of this exercise will show the highest
number of parking spaces anticipated at any one time period, which becomes the
parking requirement for the site.
ii. In all cases, at least two-thirds (2/3s) of the number of required parking spaces shall be
provided.
3. Future Parking: The Planning Board may require the submission of a future parking plan as part
of the site plan approval. If required, the Board shall allow a reduction in the number of parking
spaces actually constructed as long as an area is clearly shown as “reserved for future parking”
and a note on the plan indicates a prohibition on any structural improvement in that area. Each
plan will be reviewed on individual need. Future Parking Areas shall be designed for their
eventual construction (including all drainage ways and structures), and shall be required to be
constructed if deemed necessary by the Town of Londonderry if after initial occupancy of the
building it is determined that the future parking spaces are needed to accommodate the number
of vehicles parking at the site.
4. Transportation Mitigation Plans:
i. Transportation mitigation plans may be implemented in conjunction with any use at the
option of the Planning Board for properties with a required number of parking spaces
exceeding two-hundred fifty (250) spaces, which shall be classified as large scale parking
facilities.
ii. New construction of large scale parking facilities, or any change to existing uses that
requires additional parking on site for large scale parking facilities, may require the
Applicant to employ parking mitigation to reduce the number of surface parking spaces if
determined appropriate by the Planning Board.
iii. Qualifying parking mitigation shall include but not be limited to: structured parking,
parking shuttles, employee carpool plans, incentives for employees to use alternative
Page 35 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
transportation such as bicycles, telecommuting plans for employees, shared parking, and
other similar plans.
iv. The Planning Board shall have the discretion to require parking mitigation for large-scale
facilities as appropriate taking into consideration stormwater, surface water impairment,
the character of the neighborhood, traffic, pedestrian safety, landscaping, and circulation.
k. Parking Design and Construction Standards:
1. General
i. All parking spaces shall be so marked by use of painted lines or other permanent striping
materials.
ii. Curb and gutter shall be installed within off-street parking and loading areas in order to
manage storm drainage, channelize traffic, protect buildings and landscaping areas, and
separate pedestrian and vehicular circulation areas.
2. Paving Materials
i. Parking Structural Requirements: The structural section of parking lots shall be as
follows: 1" wearing course, 2" base course, 6" crushed gravel, 12" bank run gravel. The
Planning Board may require increased structural sections for parking areas of heavy load
use (i.e. large trucks)
ii. Proposed and existing driveways that are upgraded as part of a site plan development
shall be constructed to the structural section standards as follows: 1 ½" wearing course 2
½" base course 6" crushed gravel, 12" bank run gravel.
iii. All parking areas shall be surfaced with asphalt or other suitable durable material
approved by the Planning Board and graded and drained to dispose of all surface water
accumulation except as identified in alternative surfacing below.
iv. Design and choice of paving materials used in pedestrian areas shall consider such factors
as function, climate, characteristics of users, availability, cost maintenance, glare,
drainage, noise, appearance, and compatibility with surroundings.
v. Alternative Surfacing - The Planning Board may permit a complete or partial substitution
of an alternative surfacing for a paved surfacing on a parking lot, provided that the Board
finds that the alternative surfacing will not be detrimental to adjacent property and streets
by reason of the generation of dust, the disintegration of the surfacing, or the dispersal of
stormwater runoff; that the surfacing is appropriate to the intensity of vehicular
movements associated with the use; and that the surfacing will support an acceptable
degree of access to the property by Fire Department apparatus.
l. Bicycle Parking
Off-street bicycle parking may be required by the Planning Board whenever any new use is established
or any existing use is enlarged for which more than ten (10) automobile parking spaces are required. If
required by the Planning Board, the quantity of bicycle stalls will be determined as shown in TABLE C
of this section.
Page 36 of 100

BICYCLE PARKING
Auto Spaces Required Bicycle Stalls Required
10-50 10% of auto
51-100 5% of auto
100+ 3% of auto
1. Requirements are additive. Once a threshold is met the previously existing requirement shall be
maintained and additional stalls shall be provided at the new level until the next threshold is met.
2. A minimum of two (2) and a maximum of twenty (20) stalls shall be provided.
3. In calculating stall requirements, all decimals and fractions shall be rounded up to the nearest
whole number.
4. All bicycle parking stalls shall be located within one-hundred (100) feet of the primary use or as
close as the closest auto space.
5. A bicycle stall shall include a delineated and safe parking area, and an appropriate structure to
which bicycles can be locked.
6. Appropriate structure means a stand or other device constructed so as to enable the user to
secure by locking the frame and one wheel of each bicycle parked therein. Racks must be easily
usable with both U-locks and cable locks. Racks should support the bikes in a stable upright
position so that a bike, if bumped, will not fall or roll down. Racks that support a bike primarily
by a wheel, such as standard 'wire racks', are damaging to wheels, and thus are not acceptable.
7. Bicycle parking racks, shelters or lockers must be securely anchored to the ground or to a
structure.
8. Outdoor bicycle parking areas shall be surfaced with hard-surfacing material having a minimum
depth of two inches, such as pavers, asphalt or concrete, unless otherwise permitted by the
Planning Board.
9. Provision of additional amenities including but not limited to covered parking and shower
facilities is encouraged for lots over one-hundred (100) automobile spaces but not required.

3.10 LANDSCAPING DESIGN STANDARDS
a. The existing landscape of Londonderry is diverse, containing natural wooded environments, orchards
and open fields, as well as wetlands and streams. New development should be respectful and sensitive
to the dominant landscape character of Londonderry as a whole.
b. The purpose of landscaping design standards in Londonderry are to:
1. Preserve and enhance the character of Londonderry’s landscape
2. Enhance the goals of the Master Plan, the Zoning Ordinance, and the Orchard and Open Space
Preservation Plan, and provide attractive settings for new development.
3. Preserve and enhance local and regional open space resources such as, but not limited to, the
apple orchards and the Musquash Conservation Area.
4. Preserve the integrity of valuable historic resources, particularly stonewalls and dwellings and
structures listed in the Heritage Commission's Cultural Resource Survey.
5. Support and encourage the use of sustainable design principles and operating practices that
preserve and enhance wildlife habitats, water quality, and overall health of the natural
environment.
6. Encourage the use of indigenous plant material to provide natural habitat and food sources and to
maintain ecological diversity.
7. Maintain a quality image of the public spaces within Londonderry and high property values for
present and future development
c. General Requirements:
1. All required landscaping shall be located entirely within the lot, unless agreements have been
made with the Town for landscaping in the road right-of-way.
2. Native plants shall be used in appropriate locations, such that individual plants are selected for
their ability to thrive in or adapt to the particular soil and light conditions they are placed in.
(For a list of recommended native plants, see Appendix LS1: Notes on Native Trees and Shrubs
and Their Use in Landscaping)
3. Under no circumstances shall any plants be used that are recognized by the horticultural or
agricultural industries as invasive, whether they are native or exotic (non-native). (For a list of
known invasive plants, see Appendix LS2: Notes on Native Trees and Shrubs and Their Use in
Landscaping)
4. All plant material shall have a minimum winter hardiness for Zone 5B as determined by the
American Standards for Nursery Stock.
5. Minimum sizes for plant material, unless indicated elsewhere in these regulations or the Zoning
Ordinance, shall be as follows:
i. Deciduous shade trees: 2 ½ to 3 inch caliper,
ii. Deciduous ornamental trees: 1 ½ to 2 inch caliper, and
iii. Evergreen trees: 5 to 6 foot height.
6. Landscaping shall be laid out in informal drifts rather than formal rows and shall undulate with
site topography. Individual clusters of trees or islands of shrub beds are acceptable as long as the
tree clusters and/or shrub islands overlap. Linear solutions shall be avoided wherever possible,
unless existing landscaping is so arranged.
7. The applicant may request that the Planning Board determine that existing vegetation is suitably
located, sufficiently visually impervious, and vigorous enough to be substituted for landscaping
material required by these regulations. The applicant shall provide information to support the
substitution on the form of images of existing conditions and cross sections through critical
views.
8. Plant material located within 20 feet of any road or other paved area shall consist of species
Page 38 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
recognized by the nursery, horticultural and botanical industries as being tolerant of roadway
deicing salts.
9. Landscaping requirements for parking lots are provided in this section.
10. Landscaping shall be maintained in good condition, and any dead vegetation shall be replaced
within one year.
11. No person shall deface, alter the location, of, or remove any stonewall which was made for the
purpose of marking the boundary of, or borders, any road in the Town of Londonderry, except
upon written consent of the Planning Board with written comments from the Heritage
Commission.
i. The Heritage Commission will use the following guidelines for making recommendations
to the Planning Board for the reconstruction of stonewalls disturbed by construction
activity:
a. Reconstruction should be done in a fieldstone farm-style wall.
b. Use of existing boulders and fieldstone already in place is strongly recommended.
c. Walls should be drystacked with a rustic level topline.
d. The center of the wall should be filled with smaller native stone.
e. Stone should be used from the property and mixed as needed with native New
England fieldstone.
f. Walls should be no higher than 3 feet in height, and approximately 3-6 feet deep
g. The Heritage Commission recommends applicants refer to Chapter 8 of “The Granite
Kiss”, by Kevin Gardner, Susan Allport, and Guillermo Nunez (ISBN# 0881505463,
© 2003, Countryman Press)
h. The detail, below should be used as a general guideline for reconstruction of
stonewalls:
ii. The Applicant shall take photographs of existing stonewalls that are proposed to be
disturbed by development. These photographs will be made part of the project file, and
can be utilized by the Heritage Commission as they make recommendations on stonewall
disturbances.
12. Landscaping shall be designed so that it does not interfere with sight distances at driveways.
d. Preservation of Existing Vegetation
1. Buildings, parking, loading docks, access roads, and other site elements shall be sited to preserve
existing healthy mature vegetation and maintain natural topography to the maximum extent
feasible.
2. Healthy trees with a minimum 12 inch caliper, and existing wooded areas are recommended for
preservation, particularly those trees located within setback areas where buildings cannot be
constructed.
3. Construction activities and site alterations shall not disturb the root zone of the trees designated
for preservation. During construction, the applicant shall install and maintain tree protection
fencing, or other protective measures approved by the Planning Board, located 12 inches off the
Page 39 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
drip-line of the trees to be protected. All no-cut zones shall be appropriately monumented and
delineated on the site plan.
4. The applicant shall be responsible to replace any trees designated to remain, which have been
damaged, killed, or removed as a result of construction activities. The Planning Board requires
replacement in a manner that will ensure the new trees will have the best chance to thrive over
time. Horticultural standards shall be used to determine tree spacing. Whenever possible, two (2)
or more new trees may be required. The minimum size for replacement plant material shall be the
same as required for new trees. The Planning Board may find that additional plant material may
be necessary to augment the loss, if there are screening requirements associated with the location.
e. Screening
1. Screening shall be a year-round visually impermeable barrier that may be existing, constructed,
or a combination thereof.
i. Existing screens may consist of natural topographic landforms, rock outcrops, or
vegetation that is dense enough to be visually impermeable.
ii. Constructed screens may consist of built screens, such as walls or fences, topographic
screens, such as berms or landforms, vegetative screens consisting entirely of evergreen
material, or a combination thereof.
2. Screening is required to soften the visual impact of buildings, parking areas loading docks, trash
disposal areas, exterior storage, and other unsightly areas associated with or generated by a
particular development as viewed from a public right-of-way, residential zoning districts, and the
principal entrances of buildings on abutting lots.
3. The use of existing vegetation, topography, and natural features to comply with screening
requirements is encouraged.
4. Screening may be required, at the discretion of the Planning Board, along the entire front setback
or only a part of it. Screening may also be required to extend beyond the minimum setback areas
or further into the lot, particularly if the building is located beyond the minimum setback or if the
lot configuration is such that visibility into side or rear setbacks is open from the public right-ofway,
residences, and principal entrances on abutting lots.
5. A minimum of 50% of built screens which face the public right-of-way, residences, and principal
entrances on abutting lots shall be softened with landscaping.
6. Vegetative screens shall achieve a minimum of 75% vertical opacity to a height of 6 feet, yearround,
within one year of installation. Screening shall not be located so as to impede vehicular
or pedestrian traffic.
f. Maintenance
1. The owner of any lot shall be responsible for the maintenance of all landscaped open space,
natural screens, and constructed screens within the lot. Landscaping shall be maintained in good
condition such that planting shall be vigorous and in good health at all times and that the parcel
shall present a healthy, neat, and orderly appearance, free from refuse and debris. Any dead
vegetation that is part of the approved landscaping design shall be replaced within one year of
installation.
2. Landscaping shall be maintained so that it does not interfere with sight distances at driveways.
3. The Planning Board, at its discretion, may require a landscape maintenance and water
management plan. The maintenance plan shall include, but not be limited to the following:
i. Integrated Turf Management: mowing schedule, weed control, pest control, soil pH
management, fertilizer plan, aeration/dethatching schedule, repair/replacement plan.
ii. Shrub and Groundcover Management: mulch schedule, weed control, pruning where
needed for visibility, preventative pest/disease management, repair/replacement plan.
iii. Tree Management: mulch schedule, weed control, deadwood removal, pruning schedule,
particularly for trees located next to walkways or roadways, fertilizing schedule,
preventative pest/disease management, repair/replacement plan.
Page 40 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
iv. Water Systems Management: water source, system description, spring start-up, fall closeout,
system testing schedule, repair/replacement plan. The applicant may install a
permanent water supply system consisting of a sprinkler system and/or hose bibs placed at
appropriate locations and intervals. Wherever possible, irrigation water shall be derived
from sources other than the municipal water system, including reclaimed or “gray water,”
re-used water, detained stormwater, roof drainage, or water from on-site wells. “Gray
water” is water from sinks, showers, dishwashers, and washing machines. On-site cisterns
may be installed to store water for irrigation.
v. Rodent Control: design preventative measures, operational preventative measures,
monitoring, schedule, remediative action plan.
vi. Seasonal Maintenance: Spring clean-up plan, fall clean-up plan, disposal plans for leaves
and plant debris, winter plowing plan, winter deicing plan.
g. Mitigating the Impacts of Parking Lots:
1. A minimum percentage of the overall interior area of a parking lot (as measured by the exterior
perimeter) shall be dedicated to landscaped areas (to be included on the landscape plans) with
ground cover, shrubbery, and trees, as appropriate, as follows:
i. 10% on parking lots located in front of the principal building or on otherwise vacant lots.
ii. 8% on parking lots located on the side of the principal building, set back from the front
boundary line at least even with the front of the principal building.
iii. 5% on parking lots which are located at the rear of the principal building and largely
obscured from the road.
2. Landscaping within parking areas shall provide visual and climatic relief from broad expanses of
pavement and shall be designed to channel and define logical areas for pedestrian and vehicular
circulation.
3. Internal parking lot landscaping, as required by item 1, above, shall contain one deciduous shade
tree for every 15 parking spaces. Trees shall be distributed throughout the parking lot as evenly
as possible. Trees shall be set back at least 5 feet minimum from the face of the curb. Tree
placement and parking lot lighting shall not conflict. Interior parking lot landscaping may be
waived in truck parking areas provided they are screened and perimeter plantings, as described in
items 5-7 below, are provided.
4. All landscaped areas shall be protected from encroachment by vehicles by means of curbing,
landscaping timbers, curb stops, or other acceptable means.
5. Shade trees shall be provided around the perimeter of all parking areas at a minimum ratio of 1
tree per 20 feet of parking lot perimeter. In portions of parking areas where screening is
required, shade trees shall be provided along the perimeter at a minimum ration of 1 tree per 50
feet of parking lot perimeter in addition to the required screening. Trees may be clustered or
grouped, if desired, as long as clusters/groups are not more than 75 feet apart.
6. All off-street parking areas located at the front or side of principal buildings or on vacant lots
shall be screened from the public right-of-way with appropriate screening, as described in
Section 3.09e, to provide at least 50% vertical opacity on average up to a height of 3-1/2 feet
above grade, excluding sight distance areas at vehicular entrances and exits. If vegetation is used
a hedge should be planted which is reasonably expected to reach this opacity and height within 1
year. If non-vegetative materials are used, appropriate ground cover, shrubs, and trees shall be
planted (or retained) within the front area to soften the development.
7. Screening from Residences: All off-street parking areas shall be screened from abutting
residences or vacant lots in residential zoning districts (AR-I and R-III) located at the side or rear
of the property with a wall, fence, vegetation or other means which provides at least 75% vertical
opacity up to a height of six (6) feet above grade. If vegetation is used a hedge should be planted
which is reasonably expected to reach this opacity and height within one year (see Section
3.09e).

3.11 SOIL & WETLAND IDENTIFICATION: The applicant shall be required to identify existing soils in
accordance with Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) mapping for Rockingham County. All
wetlands impacting the project shall also be field delineated and certified by a Certified Wetland Scientist in
accordance with Section VIII of the Londonderry Zoning Ordinance. In addition, any vernal pools should
be noted in the wetland delineation.
3.12 BUILDING & GENERAL APPEARANCE DESIGN STANDARDS:
a. The applicant shall submit a rendering of the proposed building showing front, side and rear view
elevations. The building design should be consistent with the character of the Town of Londonderry
and sensitive to its natural and man-made surroundings. The design goals of this section are to promote
traditional New England style buildings for commercial development; and to encourage high quality
building design which improves the aesthetic character of the community. Applicants are encouraged
to review the Londonderry Heritage Commission’s “Look Book” for examples of preferred design
examples. Non-residential buildings are subject to the following design guidelines and standards. In
this section, “Standards” are mandatory; “Guidelines” are not mandatory, but are provided in order to
educate planners, design consultants, developers and Town staff about the design objectives. These
standards and guidelines are to be used in conjunction with the all other sections of these regulations
and Town ordinances. Any waiver from a standard in this section must be made in writing, and be
supported by justification in accordance with Section 7.04
b. SCALE AND PROPORTION OF NON-RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS
1. Guidelines
i. New buildings should not exceed the average height of existing buildings on abutting
property and the general area, however, greater distances between buildings may allow
for larger differences in height.
ii. The window and wall openings of new buildings should be in similar proportions to
existing structures when they are in close proximity to the site development.
2. Standard
i. Because of their mass and typical design characteristics, large scale retail establishments
of greater than 25,000 square feet shall be subject to Section 3.12h.
c. VERTICAL OR HORIZONTAL EMPHASIS GUIDELINES
1. Relate the vertical, horizontal, or non-directional facade characteristics to the predominant
directional expression of nearby buildings. This emphasis is created by the arrangement of the
structure’s door and window openings.
2. Door and window openings should be proportional to facade length and height.
i. All windows and doors should be of a traditional New England character.
ii. Large plate glass windows are discouraged unless they are broken with mullions or
muttons.
iii. Mirrored glass or colored metal panels are not acceptable windows.
iv. Doorways should be encased with trim.
3. Foundation walls should not be exposed to more than 3 feet in height from grade.
d. ROOF FORM
1. Guidelines:
i. Roof forms should be of various pitch variety, common to traditional New England
Architecture
ii. Gable, hip roofs, shed, gambrel, mansard style roofs are acceptable. All roofs should
have appropriate overhangs.
Page 42 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
iii. Flat roofs should not be completely eliminated from consideration, but should only
be built when the size of the building does not permit a pitched roof.
iv. Shingled roofs constructed of asphalt or wooden shingles are preferred. Standing
seam, copper, or metal roofs are acceptable under certain circumstances.
v. Avoid long unbroken expanses of roofs through the use of dormers, chimneys, and
changes in ridgeline.
vi. Multiple roof plane slopes are acceptable, but should be limited.
2. Standards:
i. Roofs shall be constructed of materials which are commonly found in New England.
ii. All rooftop mechanical/ventilation equipment must be placed in such a manner so
that it is not visibly apparent at the nearest street right-of-way. This may be
accomplished by using architectural treatment/camouflaging (walls, parapets, false
chimneys, etc.) or by other appropriate means.
e. ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES AND DETAILS GUIDELINES
1. Any features and details such as balconies, decks, covered porches, columns, dormers, turrets,
towers, skylights and arches should be in proportion with the building.
2. Accurate restoration of existing detail is encouraged, however use of historical details on
contemporary structures should be included only when appropriate to the overall design
f. MATERIALS AND COLORS
1. Guidelines:
i. Exteriors of new buildings should utilize materials appropriate for the character of
the building. Brick, clapboard, shingles, stone, or architectural concrete block are
preferred, and encouraged for wall surfaces.
ii. Subtle colors should be used on larger and very plain buildings, while smaller
buildings with elaborate detailing can use more colors. Colors should reflect
traditional New England colors with accenting trim work.
iii. Colors that are disharmonious with other colors used on the building or found on
adjacent structures should be avoided.
iv. Paint colors should relate to the natural material colors found on the building such as
brick, terra-cotta, stone or ceramic tile and existing elements such as signs or
awnings.
v. Contrasting colors, which accent architectural details and entrances, are encouraged.
2. Standards:
i. All exterior surfaces visible to the public shall be covered with a siding material and
long term maintenance characteristics of all materials should be considered during
the selection process.
ii. Neon tubing shall not be used as a feature, trim, or accent area for buildings.
iii. The rear and side elevations shall incorporate the materials, design details and theme
when exposed to public view.
g. SIGNAGE: Signs should be visible and legible through the use of appropriate details and proper
locations. Allowable sign areas and locations are explained in Section 3.11 of the Londonderry Zoning
Ordinance. The following design guidelines will give examples and methods of adding interest and
quality to a building project while enhancing the overall project.
1. Scale and proportion: Every sign should be an integral, subordinate element within the overall
building and site design. The scale and proportion of the signage shall not overpower the
building or obscure the building’s architectural features.
2. Materials: Sign materials should harmonize with the building’s design. A simple and direct
message, with upper and lowercase lettering is most effective. A limited number of colors
should be used with light colored lettering placed on a matte, dark background which reduces
Page 43 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
reflected glare.
3. Illumination: Illumination of signs should be from an indirect light source to reduce glare and
ensure attention is focused on the sign. The light should be contained within the sign frame
and not spill over onto other portions of the building or site. Internally illuminated signage
should provide opaque backgrounds with translucent lettering.
4. Coordination: All signage within a building complex should be coordinated by using similar
materials, lettering, styles, colors, and overall sign sizes to ensure sign continuity and a
uniform appearance throughout the development.
5. Logos and Graphics: Company logos should be incorporated into the overall sign and not
become the sign itself.
h. DESIGN GUIDELINES AND STANDARDS FOR LARGE RETAIL ESTABLISHMENTS
1. The following standards and guidelines are intended to be used as design aid by developers
proposing large retail developments and as an evaluation tool by the Town staff and the
Planning Board in their review processes. These standards and guidelines apply to all projects
for retail establishments of more than 25,000 square feet.
2. FACADES AND EXTERIOR WALLS
i. Guidelines:
a. Facades should be articulated to reduce the massive scale and the uniform,
impersonal appearances of large retail buildings and provide visual interest that
will be consistent with the community’s identity character, and scale. The
intent is to encourage a more human scale that Londonderry residents will be
able to identify with their community.
b. Avoid expanses of wall using jogs, pilasters, architectural detailing, changes in
surface materials, colors, textures, and rooflines.
c. Uninterrupted facades should not exceed 50% of the building wall.
ii. Standards:
a. Facades greater than 100 feet in length, measured horizontally, shall
incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of a least 3% of
the length of the facade and extending at least 20% of the length of the facade.
No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed 100 horizontal feet.
b. Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display
windows, entry areas, awnings, or other such features along no less than 60%
of their horizontal length.
3. DETAIL FEATURES
i. Guideline: Buildings should have architectural features and patterns that provide
visual interests, at the scale of the pedestrian, reduce massive aesthetic effects, and
recognize local character. The elements in the following standard should be integral
parts of the building fabric, and not superficially applied trim or graphics, or paint.
ii. Standard: Building facades must include a repeating pattern that shall include no less
than three of the elements listed below. At least one of these elements shall repeat
horizontally. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet,
either horizontally or vertically.
a. Color Change
b. Texture Change
c. Material Module Change
d. Expression of architectural or structural bay through a change in plane no less
than 12 inches in width, such as an offset, reveal, or projecting rib.
Page 44 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
4. ROOFS:
i. Guideline: Variations in roof lines should be used to add interest to, and reduce the
massive scale of large buildings. Roof features should compliment the character of
adjoining neighborhoods.
ii. Standard: Roofs shall have no less than 2 of the following features:
a. Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as HVAC units
from public view. The average height of such parapets shall not exceed 15% of
the height of the supporting wall and such parapets shall not at any point
exceed one-third of the height of the supporting wall. Such parapets shall
feature three-dimensional cornice treatment.
b. Overhanging eaves, extending no less than 3 feet past the supporting walls.
c. Sloping roofs that do not exceed the average height of the supporting walls,
with an average slope greater than or equal to 1 foot of vertical rise for every 1
foot of horizontal run, and less than or equal to 1 foot of vertical rise for every
1 foot of horizontal run.
d. Three or more roof slope planes.
5. MATERIALS AND COLORS
i. Guideline: Exterior building materials and colors comprise a significant part of the
visual impact of a building. Therefore, they should be aesthetically pleasing and
compatible with materials and colors used in adjoining neighborhoods.
ii. Standards:
a. Predominant exterior building materials shall be high quality materials. These
include, without limitation: Brick, wood, granite sandstone, other native stone,
tinted/textured concrete masonry units.
b. Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. The
use of high intensity colors, metallic colors, black or fluorescent colors is
prohibited.
c. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary
colors, but neon tubing shall not be an acceptable feature for building trim or
accent areas.
d. Predominant exterior building materials shall not include the following:
smooth faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels, pre-fabricated steel
panels.
6. ENTRYWAYS
i. Guideline: Entryway design elements and variations should give orientation and
aesthetically pleasing character to the building. The standards identify desirable
entryway design features.
ii. Standard: Each principal building on a site shall have clearly defined, highly visible
customer entrances featuring no less than three of the following:
a. canopies or porticos
b. overhangs
c. recesses/projections
d. arcades
e. raised corniced parapets over the door
f. peaked roof forms
g. arches
h. outdoor patios
i. display windows
j. architectural details such as tile work and moldings which are integrated into
Page 45 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
the building structure and design
k. integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places
for sitting
7. BACK AND SIDE FACADES
i. Guideline: All facades of a building which are visible from adjoining properties
and/or public streets should contribute to the pleasing scale features of the building
and encourage community integration by featuring characteristics similar to the front
facade.
ii. Standard: All building facades, which are visible from adjoining properties and/or
public streets, shall comply with the requirements of Section 3.12h, item 2, above.
3.13 OUTDOOR LIGHTING DESIGN STANDARDS:
a. The following words and terms related to outdoor lighting are defined as follows:
1. Disability Glare- The eye’s Line-of-Sight contact with a direct light source, which causes a
partial blindness
2. Footcandle- A unit of measure for illuminance. A unit of illuminance on a surface that is
everywhere one foot from a uniform point source of light of one candle and equal to one
lumen per square foot
3. Full cut off type fixture - A luminaire or light fixture that; by design of the housing, does not
allow any light dispersion or direct glare to shine above 90 degree, horizontal plane from the
base of the fixture. Full cut-off fixtures must be installed in a horizontal position as designed,
or the purpose of the design is defeated, and disability glare will result.
4. Horizontal Illuminance- The measurement of brightness from a light source, usually measured
in footcandles or lumens, which is taken through a light meter’s sensor at a horizontal
position.
5. Light Trespass- Light from an artificial light source that is intruding into an area where it is
not wanted or does not belong.
6. Uplighting- Any light source that distributes illumination above a 90 degree horizontal plane.
7. Uniformity Ratio (U. Ratio) - Describes the average level of illumination in relation to the
lowest level of illumination for a given area. Example: U. Ratio =4:1 for the given area, the
lowest level of illumination (1) should be no less than 25% or “4 times less” than the average
(4 ) level of illumination.
b. Purpose: It is the goal of this section to provide further guidance to developers in implementing the
lighting sections of the Londonderry Zoning Ordinance. Further, it is also the goal of this section to
establish minimum requirements for lighting for all non-residential projects (non-residential projects
include multi-family proposals). Recognizing that inappropriate and poorly designed or installed
outdoor lighting causes unsafe and unpleasant conditions, limits residents ability to enjoy the
nighttime sky, and results in unnecessary use of electric power. Conversely, it is also recognized that
some outdoor lighting is appropriate in areas such as civic, commercial and industrial centers. To
ensure appropriate lighting while minimizing its undesirable side effects, the following regulations
are established.
c. General Requirements
1. That all exterior lights and illuminated signs shall be designed, located, installed and directed
Page 46 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
in such a manner as to prevent objectionable light, and glare across, the property lines and
disability glare at any location on or off the property. The “maintained horizontal illuminance
recommendation” set by the illuminating Engineers Society of North America (IES) shall be
observed. (See appendix LIGHT 1)
2. All parking area lighting shall be full cut-off type fixtures.
3. Uplighting is not permitted. Externally lit signs, display, building and aesthetic lighting must
be shielded to prevent direct glare and/or light trespass over property lines in excess of 0.2
footcandles, except at driveway intersections with streets or at interconnections with adjacent
parking lots. The lighting must also be, as much as physically possible, contained to the target
area. Internally lit signs are acceptable provided that they meet the requirements of the
Londonderry Zoning Ordinance.
4. All building lighting for security or aesthetics will be full cut-off or a shielded type, not
allowing any upward distribution of light. Flood lighting is discouraged, and if used, must be
shielded to prevent:
i. Disability glare for drivers or pedestrians,
ii. Light trespass beyond the property line, and
iii. Light above a 90 degree, horizontal plane. Unshielded wallpack type fixtures are not
acceptable.
5. Adjacent to residential property, no direct light source will be visible at the property line at
ground level or above.
6. All non-essential lighting will be required to be turned off after business hours, leaving only
the necessary lighting for security. (“Non-essential” can apply to: display, aesthetic, parking
and sign lighting).
7. When outdoor lighting installation or replacement is part of a development proposal for which
site plan approval is required under these regulations, the Planning Board shall review and
approve the lighting installation as part of its site plan approval.
8. Lighting of Gas Station/Convenience Store Aprons and Canopies: All of the above standards
shall apply, as well as the standards in Appendix LIGHT 2.
9. When an outdoor lighting installation is being modified, extended, expanded or added to, the
entire outdoor lighting installation shall be subject to the requirements of this section
10. Expansion, additions, or replacements to outdoor lighting installations shall be designed to
avoid harsh contrast in color and or lighting levels
11. Electrical service to outdoor lighting fixtures shall be underground.
12. Proposed lighting installations that are not covered in this section may be approved if the
Planning Board finds that they are designed to minimize glare, do not direct light beyond the
boundaries in excess of 0.2 footcandles of the area being illuminated or onto adjacent
properties or streets, and do not result in excessive lighting levels. The U-Ratio for any site
may not be greater than 4:1.
13. For the purposes of these regulations, the mounting height of a lighting fixture shall be defined
as the vertical distance from the grade elevation of the surface being illuminated to the bottom
of the lighting fixture (i.e luminaire).
14. Temporary (3 months) Holiday lighting during the months of November, December and
January shall be exempt for the provisions of this section, provided that such lighting does not
create dangerous glare or adjacent streets or properties.
15. The Planning Board may modify the requirements of this section if it determines that in so
doing, it will not jeopardize the intent of these regulations.
3.14 TRAFFIC IMPACT ANALYSIS
a. SUBMITTALS: Most projects must provide a report meeting the requirements outlined for a “short”
traffic impact analysis. If the application is for a proposed use with verified minimal traffic generation
in an Industrial Zone, a site plan amendment or change of use, then a minor analysis may be provided.
Page 47 of 100
Revised 1-10-2018
If any of the following conditions apply, then a “full” traffic impact analysis must be completed:
1. Trip generation exceeding 1,000 average daily trips or 100 peak hour trips. Peak hour is
defined as any of the following:
i. AM peak hour (7-9 AM);
ii. PM peak hour (4-6 PM);
iii. Saturday midday peak hour (11AM-1PM); and
iv. Peak hour generator for certain land uses (e.g., school, movie theater) if it falls outside
the three previously listed periods. Analysis of Saturday midday peak only applies to
retail uses.

b. REQUIRED FOR MINOR ANALYSIS
1. The Applicant shall provide a Traffic Letter after confirming with Staff that the project would
not be subject to a “Short Analysis”.
2. Trip Generation: The Traffic Letter shall include a trip generation analysis based upon the ITE
Trip Generation Handbook - latest edition. Where the applicant feels the ITE trip generation
is not representative of the proposed development, justification must be provided for
alternative trip generation methodology. If counts are performed to determine trip generation
rates, the applicant must conduct two separate counts and provide full details of the count
locations, including the size of the facility, percent occupancy, location, adjacent road
Average Daily Traffic (ADT), time, and date of count.
c. REQUIRED FOR “SHORT” ANALYSIS: The primary objective of the “Short” analysis is to justify
that a “Full” analysis is not required.At a minimum, the “Short” analysis must include the following:
1. Description of Site: A brief narrative of the character of the site and adjacent properties,
including land uses and other pertinent facts.
2. Description of Roadways: A brief narrative of the study area roadway facilities, including the

available sight distance at each study intersection with Town of Londonderry standards shall
be included.
4. Trip Generation: In all cases, the analysis shall include trip generation based upon the ITE
Trip Generation Handbook - latest edition. Where the applicant feels the ITE trip generation
is not representative of the proposed development, justification must be provided for
alternative trip generation methodology. If counts are performed to determine trip generation
rates, the applicant must conduct two separate counts and provide full details of the count
locations, including the size of the facility, percent occupancy, location, adjacent road
Average Daily Traffic (ADT), time, and date of count.
5. Trip Distribution: At the “Short” analysis level, trip distribution shall be described in a report
that demonstrates knowledge of area-wide land uses, roadway facilities, and predominant
traffic flows by time of day. The analysis shall contain a percentage distribution of trips (by
direction) to the adjacent roadway facilities and any relevant assumptions. All assumptions
made shall be outlined, with justification, in the report. It is recommended that the Applicant
consult with Staff prior to commencing a study to determine the scope of the trip distribution
analysis.
6. The report shall be stamped by a professional engineer.

contained in the “Full” analysis.
3. Existing Traffic Counts: In no case shall existing traffic counts used in the analysis be more
than two years old (from date of count to date of analysis submittal). If a significant change
(e.g., new roadway or development) has occurred within the last two years, the Planning
Department and/or Department of Public Works can, at their discretion, require that new
counts be conducted. Traffic counts shall include information on date, time, day of week, and
name of the firm or individual who performed the counts. Traffic counts shall be seasonally
adjusted to average and peak conditions.
4. Design Year Traffic Projection:
i. Design Year: The design year for traffic projections shall be 10 years from the current
year.
ii. The applicant shall obtain a list from the Town of Londonderry containing all proposed
developments permitted to date within the study area. The traffic generated by these
projects shall be added to the no-build and build analyses. Additionally, the
background growth rate should be determined based upon information obtained from
the NH Department of Transportation or the Southern New Hampshire Regional
Planning Commission. The calculated background growth rate should be completely
documented and included in the study for review.
iii. Trip Generation: Traffic projection for trip generation growth is described in the
“Short” analysis section.
iv. Trip Distribution: The applicant shall provide justification for the assumed trip
distribution. The trip distribution methodology should be representative of the type of
development. Data may be obtained from employee zip code analysis, studies of
similar sites, analysis of ADT on adjacent roadways, US Census journey to work and
home-based work/non-work trips, or other sources. Graphic presentation shall be
provided showing 1) peak hour trips added by the development, and 2) study area peak
hour traffic volumes under each of the following scenarios:

b. Existing conditions with proposed development;
c. No build for design year, and;
d. Build for design year.
5. Peak Hour Capacity Analysis: Capacity analysis is to be performed at all study intersections
(including driveways) using the most current Highway Capacity Manual Level of Service
methodology for signalized and unsignalized intersections. Each of the four scenarios listed
above must be analyzed at a minimum. A gap acceptance analysis should be provided in the
case of adjustment to the default critical gap in the capacity analysis.
6. Safety Analysis: Accident data for the roadways and intersections included in the study area
shall be obtained from the Londonderry Police Department. Accident history for the three
most recent years available shall be summarized and compared to the Statewide or national
rates established for the corresponding facility type (e.g., rural two-lane highway, urban
arterial, etc.).
i. The minimum all season sight distance shall be three-hundred sixty-five (365) feet in
all directions meeting the requirements for roadway intersections and Exhibit D3 of the
Londonderry Subdivision Regulations.
7. Trucks: The location of loading docks and/or delivery drop-off areas shall be given in the
analysis. The estimated frequency of trucks by time of day shall be provided when the number
of daily truck trips exceeds 30 percent of the ADT on any roadway in the study area.
8. Parking: There should be a defined correlation between estimated trip generation and parking
space requirements. The proposal shall contain a comparison of daily and peak hour trip
generation estimates to the number of proposed parking spaces on site. Consider the impact of
shared parking arrangements using the methodology outlined in Section 3.09j.2.i of the Site

Revised 1-10-2018
Plan Regulations.
9. Narrative: Discussion of the following shall be provided:
i. Travel safety characteristics of any streets substantially impacted by allowing the
“build” alternative, considering such things as sight distance limitations, width
limitations, horizontal or vertical alignment deficiencies, and surface conditions;
ii. Streetside safety of any streets substantially impacted, considering such things as the
amount and type of development along such streets, presence of sidewalks, vehicle
speeds, and any outstanding limitations in sight distance or road configuration;
iii. Impact on pedestrian safety and convenience;
iv. Noise impacts on residential premises.
10. Mitigation: Any mitigating measures proposed shall be described in detail and included in the
analysis. It is imperative that the applicants identify improvements to intersections even if
they don’t fund them fully. Transportation Demand Management (TDM), non-vehicular
transportation and mass transit should be strongly considered as mitigating strategies.
e. STANDARDS
1. If not more severely limited under other provisions of other laws or regulations, the absolute
increase in calculated intersection delay, under “build” conditions, shall be no more than 10-
20 seconds.
2. Average daily traffic volumes shall not be increased by more than one-third above the “nobuild”
level on any street.
f. PROCEDURE
1. Applicants shall contact the Planning Department early in the project design regarding the
scoping of any traffic studies, including consideration of the study area boundary, the
definition of “alternative” where involved, and the type of mitigation, if any, which are likely
to prove appropriate.

businesses. The purpose of these regulations and the zoning provisions is to:
1. facilitate the provision of wireless communication services to the residents and businesses of the
town;
2. minimize adverse visual impacts of wireless communications facilities through design and siting
standards;
3. encourage the location of facilities in non-residential areas;
4. avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural standards and
setback requirements; and,
5. discourage proliferation of antenna support structures through sharing requirements.
b. Process. In addition to the information required for site plans elsewhere in these regulations,
development applications for wireless communications facilities shall include the following
information:
1. A report from a NH licensed professional engineer which:
i. specifies the facility's height and design including a cross section and elevation,
ii. documents the height above grade for all potential mounting positions for co-located
antennas and the minimum separation distances between antennas;
iii. describes the antenna support structure's capacity, including the number and type of
antennas that it can accommodate;
iv. documents what steps the applicant will take to avoid interference with established public
safety telecommunications;
v. includes an engineer's stamp and registration number.
2. For all antenna support structures (towers), a letter of intent committing the owner and his or her
successors in interest to allow the shared use of the tower if an additional user agrees in writing
to meet reasonable terms and conditions for shared use.
3. The following items shall be submitted as part of any application (at the Planning Board's option
they may be submitted as part of precedent conditions on any approval, prior to issuance of a
building permit).

structure locations within a 20 mile radius of the proposed antenna support structure.
ii. A written description of why less visually intrusive alternatives for the proposed facility
were not proposed.
c. Design. The following design standards apply:
1. The lowest six (6) feet of the facility shall be visually screened by trees, large shrubs, solid
walls, fences and/or other structures.
2. The height and mass of the facility shall not exceed that which is essential for its intended
use.
3. The color of the proposed facility will be of a light tone or color (except where otherwise
required by the FAA) so as to minimize the visual impact.
4. There shall be a security fence around the base of the support structure base or the lot where
the support structure is located.
5. The proposed facility will not unreasonably impair the view of or from any public park,
natural scenic vista, historic building or district, or significant view corridor.
6. All reasonable efforts shall be made to camouflage or disguise the tower to look like trees or
other appropriate alternative designs that blend in to the particular environment. Those
towers that are not of an alternative design shall be of a monopole design.
d. Process for antennas mounted on existing structures. The placement of antennas on existing support
structures may be approved administratively - by the Administrative Review Committee - provided
the proposal meets all applicable Town requirements, as follows:
1. Site and building plans shall be submitted and approved as specified herein.
2. A report prepared by a professional engineer indicating the existing structure's suitability to
accept the antenna, and the proposed method of affixing the antenna to the structure shall be
submitted along with complete details of all fixtures and couplings, and the precise point of
attachment shall be indicated.
3. In cases where insignificant additional support structures are needed, such as the erection of
a small structure on an existing rooftop which will not be visible from the road, these
applications may be approved administratively, at the reasonable discretion of the staff.

of any site plan improvements, the applicant shall notify the DPW in writing of the time he/she
proposes to commence construction of such improvements and shall pay to the Town the escrow for
the inspection fee required by the DPW. The DPW will arrange for inspection by the Town’s agent
to assure that all standards, specifications and requirements are met during the construction of the
required improvements and utilities. The applicant shall request to schedule a preconstruction
meeting with the DPW which is mandatory prior to the start of construction.
c. PROPER INSTALLATION OF IMPROVEMENTS: If the Town or the Town’s agent finds, upon
inspection of the improvements performed before the expiration of any security, that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with approved plans and
specifications of any conditions of approval of the Planning Board, the status shall be reported to the
DPW. The DPW shall then notify the Applicant, and if necessary, the bonding company or escrow
agent and take all necessary steps to preserve the Town’s rights under the bond or agreement. No
plan shall be certified (signed by the Planning Board for final approval) by the Planning Board, nor
shall a Certificate of Occupancy by issued by the Building Department, as long as the applicant is in
default on a previously approved subdivision or site plan.
d. FAILURE TO COMPLETE IMPROVEMENTS OR ABANDON PROJECT:
1. When a performance bond has been posted and required off-site improvements have not been
installed or completed in accordance within the terms of said performance, the Planning Board
may declare the project in default and direct the DPW to use the bond to complete all
outstanding required improvements.
2. When an applicant fails to complete all required on-site improvements as shown on approved site
plans, the Planning Board shall proceed with the Site Plan Revocation process as outlined in
Section 7.09d.
6.03 AS-BUILTS
a. The applicant shall submit to the Town Engineer detailed "as-built " plans (electronic as-built file in
a form as described in Section 2.05n, mylar reproducible and one paper print) of the site plan. The
applicant's engineer shall certify to the Town Engineer that the layout of the line and grade of all
public improvements is in accordance with improvement plans of the site plan.
b. When a revision to the approved plan is proposed, the applicant shall submit a print of the approved
plan indicating the proposed revision to the Town Engineer. The revision shall be reviewed by the
Town Engineer and if necessary the Board. All approved revisions shall be shown on the “as-built”
plan required at the completion of the project.
6.04 MAINTENANCE OF OFF-SITE IMPROVEMENTS
a. The applicant shall be required to maintain all off-site improvements until the acceptance of said
improvements by the Town.
b. The applicant may request reductions in performance surety prior to final acceptance. However, a
minimum 10% retainage on each item shall remain until the final inspection and acceptance of the
project by the Department of Public Works. Upon recommendation from the Department of Public
Works and acceptance of the project by the Town Council, 2% retainage of the total performance
surety, but not less than $7,500, will remain in place in order to assure the satisfactory condition of
Page 64 of 100

the required improvements for a period of one year after the date of acceptance by the Town. The
financial guarantee shall be in accordance with section 6.01b.
c. The Town Council will not release, nor reduce, an assurance until the Public Works Director has
submitted a letter stating that all required improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication
to the local government, and are free and clear of any and all liens and encumbrances. Upon such
approval and recommendation, the Town Council shall accept the improvements for dedication.

SECTION 7 ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT
7.01 AMENDMENTS: For the purpose of providing for the public health, safety and general welfare the Board
may amend, change, alter, add or rescind the provisions imposed by these regulations. Notification, public
hearings, publications and certification of all proposed amendments shall be accomplished by the Board in
accordance with NH RSA § 675:6 and 675:7.
7.02 SAVING PROVISION: These regulations replace and supersede the former regulations of the Board.
Adoption of these regulations is not intended to invalidate any approval or requirement of approval under
the former regulations and shall not be considered applicable to any application which has been formally
accepted by the planning board pursuant to RSA 676:4, I(b) prior to the first legal notice of a proposed
adoption of regulations.
7.03 INTERPRETATION, CONFLICT and SEPARABILITY: The provisions herein shall be considered the
minimum requirements for the protection of public health, safety and welfare. These regulations are not
intended to interfere with the application of other laws or regulations or privately imposed restrictions.
Where these regulations may differ from other applicable laws or regulations, whichever provisions are
more restrictive or impose higher standards shall govern. If any part of these regulations is determined to
be invalid, that determination will be construed applicable to that part only and the remainder of these
regulations will be construed to continue in full force.
7.04 WAIVERS: In a case when the strict application of these regulations would:

owner of the affected property; or
b. An alternative site planning and building design approach meets the design objectives as stated in the
regulations, equally well or better than would compliance with the regulations; and
c. In either of the foregoing circumstances, the waiver may be granted without substantial detriment to
the public good;
the Board may waive specific plan requirements where the Board has determined that such a waiver will not
affect the purpose and intent of these regulations. The applicant shall submit in writing a “request for
waiver” to the Board citing the specific regulation and the reason the regulation cannot be met. Any waiver
granted shall be shown on the Site Plan. In the case of proposals having lands designated as “special flood
hazard areas," these waiver provisions shall not apply to the requirements for such areas as cited in Section
1.05 of these Regulations.

cases where extenuating circumstances prevent the meeting of precedent conditions within 120 days,
the applicant may request an extension, to be filed (in writing and with justification) with the Board
no later than 14 days prior to the expiration date of the conditions. The Planning Board shall then
vote on whether or not to grant such extensions.
c. (deleted)

site plan regulations and zoning ordinances adopted by the Town of Londonderry, except those
regulations and ordinances which expressly protect public health standards, such as water quality
and sewage treatment requirements, for a period of Five (5) years after the date of certification of
the site plan by the Planning Board; provided, however, that once substantial completion of the
improvements as shown on the plans have occurred in compliance with the approved plans, or
the terms of said approval or unless otherwise stipulated by the planning board, the rights of the
owner or the owner's successor in interest shall vest and no subsequent changes in site plan
regulations or zoning ordinances shall operate to affect such improvements; and further provided

LONDONDERRY PLANNING BOARD
PROCEDURES FOR SUBDIVISION APPLICATIONS
All information provided and submitted with an application shall conform to the Londonderry Subdivision
Regulations.
To conform with the new State legislation in 1998-1999, RSA 676:4, the Town of Londonderry Planning Board will
henceforth use the following application procedure as follows:
1. Pre-application Reviews
a. An Applicant may make a written letter request for discussion of CONCEPTUAL DESIGN
INFORMATION, signed by the owner of the property, with 2 (two) copies of conceptual
information (no surveying or engineering required) to be scheduled for discussion of the proposal
in conceptual form only with the members of the Planning Board at a regular public meeting. No
abutters need to be notified, and all discussion shall be non-binding.
b. An Applicant may submit a completed Subdivision Design Review Request Form with required
fees and completed Subdivision Application Checklist marked DESIGN REVIEW, signed by the
owner of the property, with 12 (twelve) copies of the design plan with engineering detail at a level
addressing the requirements of the regulations and the completed checklist. The Design Review
Committee (DRC) and the Planning Board’s review engineering consultant shall conduct a review
and forward comments to the Applicant for incorporation into design. Abutters and the general
public shall be notified that the Town is conducting DESIGN REVIEW of the project and plans
for the project are available for review by the general public at the Planning Department.
An Applicant may make a written letter request for a public meeting with the Planning Board with
notification of abutters. All discussion and comment by Board members shall be non-binding.
It is strongly recommended to the Applicant to submit the project for DESIGN REVIEW. This will help identify
concerns of the Board and DRC, identify necessary studies, problems and deficiencies, and could minimize potential
revisions to the project based on review by DRC and the Board prior to a vote on formal acceptance. In addition,
this may aid the Applicant in obtaining the proper and required permit approvals from other regulatory agencies
necessary for Formal Application.
2. Formal Application, Acceptance and Review
a. An Applicant shall submit a Subdivision Formal Application Request Form with required fees and
the completed Subdivision Application Checklist marked FORMAL APPLICATION, signed by
the owner of the property, with 12 (twelve) sets of paper blueprints and 3 copies of all required
accompanying data, studies, and approved permits. DRC and the Planning Board’s review
engineering consultant shall conduct a review of the application, all provided information and the
completed checklist. The Planning Director shall schedule the Applicant for a public meeting with

In an effort to provide the required information necessary for a Formal Application submittal to the Planning Board
for acceptance and formal review, the attached Subdivision Application Checklist marked FORMAL
APPLICATION will be required for each Formal Application to the Board. The intent is to provide a format to the
Applicant as to the information necessary for proper review of the proposed project by the Board, the Board’s review
engineering consultant, and DRC to verify compliance with the Town’s Zoning, Health and Subdivision regulations,
and other applicable State and Federal Regulations. This should streamline the review process.
It is the Applicant’s responsibility to provide clear and complete plans and all supporting and required
information for review to allow the Board to render an informed decision on the proposed project. An
application will not be accepted if the required items as outlined in the checklist are missing from the
submittal.

CHAPTER IX – SEWER USE ORDINANCE
SECTION 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1 Purpose and Policy
This Ordinance sets forth uniform requirements for users of the Londonderry Municipal Sewer
System which transports wastewater to the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) in
Manchester and Derry and enables the Town to comply with all applicable State and federal laws,
including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 403). The Town is also subject to the provisions
of the Intermunicipal Agreement with the City of Manchester, dated May 24, 1979, (as amended) and
the Intermunicipal Agreement with the Town of Derry, dated July 10, 1981 (as amended).
Recognizing that significant opportunities exist to reduce or prevent pollution at its source through
cost effective practices, and that such practices can offer savings through reduced purchases of
materials and resources, a decreased need for pollution control technologies, and lower liability
costs, as well as assisting to protect the environment, the Town establishes the following objectives
of this Ordinance:
A. To promote, consistent with the policy of the federal government:
1. The prevention or reduction of pollutants at the source whenever feasible;
2. Recycling in an environmentally-safe manner when pollution cannot be prevented;
3. Treatment in an environmentally-safe manner of pollution that cannot be prevented or
recycled; and
4. Disposal or other release into the environment in an environmentallysafe
manner only as a last resort.
B. To encourage the development of these efforts, the Town may:
Set Town-wide pollution prevention goals;
1. Organize an assessment program task force;
2. Review data and inspect sites;
3. Develop pollution prevention options;
4. Conduct a feasibility analysis of selected options; and
5. Promote implementation of pollution prevention techniques.
C. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTWs that will interfere with its
operation;
D. To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the POTWs that will pass through the POTWs,
inadequately treated, into receiving waters, or otherwise be incompatible with the POTWs;
E. To protect both POTW personnel who may be affected by wastewater and sludge in the
course of their employment and the general public;
F. To promote reuse of sludge from the POTWs;
G. To enable the Town to comply with its Intermunicipal Agreements with the City of
Manchester and the Town of Derry for the treatment of the Town's wastewater.

SECTION 2 GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS (Cont’d.)
2.2 Building Sewers and Connections (Cont’d.)
H. During construction of a new sanitary sewer, the Town may construct the service connections
for existing buildings to the curb or the property line or the edge of a right-of-way.
Construction of the building sewer, including connection to the structures served, shall be the
responsibility of the owner of the improved property to be connected; and such owner shall
indemnify and save harmless the Town, its officers, and agents from all loss or damage that
may result, directly or indirectly, due to the construction of a building sewer on his premises
or its connection to the service connection. The owner shall thereafter be obligated to pay all
costs and expenses of operation, repair and maintenance, and of reconstruction, if needed of
the building sewer and service connection.
I. Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below
the basement floor. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity
flow to the public sewer, wastewater conveyed by such building drain shall be lifted by an
approved means and discharged to the building sewer at the owner's expense.
J. No person(s) shall make connection of roof downspouts, interior or exterior foundation
drains, area-way drains, or other sources of surface run-off or groundwater to a building
sewer or building drain that in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary
sewer.
K. No person shall obstruct the free flow of air through any drain or soil pipe.
L. The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the requirements
of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the Town, or
the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WEF Manual of
Practice No. FD-5. All such connections shall be made gas-tight and watertight and verified
by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be
approved by the Department of Public Works before installation.
M. When any street lateral is to serve a school, hospital, or similar institutional or public housing,
or is to serve a complex of industrial or commercial buildings, or which in the opinion of the
Department of Public Works, will receive sanitary sewage or industrial wastes of such volume
or character that frequent maintenance of said building sewer and street lateral is anticipated,
then such street lateral shall be connected to the public sewer through a manhole. The
Department of Public Works shall determine if and where this type of connection to the public
sewer is required. Connections to existing manholes shall be made as directed by the
Department of Public Works. If required, a new manhole shall be installed in the public sewer
at the expense of the owner.

SECTION 2 GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS (Cont’d.)
2.2 Building Sewers and Connections (Cont’d.)
N. The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the Department of Public Works
when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. Such
notice shall be provided not less than 48 hours in advance of the time any connection is to be
made to any public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of
the Department of Public Works or its representative. This requirement shall also apply to
repairs or alterations to building connections, drains or pipes thereto.
O. Suitable provisions shall be made at the point of connection for testing, which responsibility
shall rest with the holder of the sewer connection permit.
P. The owner shall be responsible for satisfying all other notification requirements, including
DIGSAFE. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the
Department of Public Works or its representative. No building sewer or repair thereto shall
be covered until it has been inspected and approved by the Department of Public Works. If
any part of a building sewer is covered before so being inspected and approved, it shall be
uncovered for inspection at the cost and expense of the owner of the building to be connected
to a sewer. This requirement shall also apply to repairs or alterations to building
connections, drains or pipes thereto. Filling of trenches before an inspection is not permitted
and will result in non-acceptance by the Town.
Q. The Department of Public Works shall maintain a record of all connections made to public
sewers and drains under this Ordinance and all repairs and alterations made to building
connections or drains connected to or discharging into public sewers and drains of the Town
or intended to so discharge. All persons concerned shall assist the Department of Public
Works in securing the data needed for such records.
R. All excavations for building sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades
and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other
public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory
to the Town at the expense of the owner.
S. Proposed new discharges from residential or commercial sources involving loadings
exceeding 50 population equivalents (5,000 gpd), any new industrial waste, or any significant
alteration in either flow or waste characteristics of industrial wastes that are being discharged
into the POTW must be approved by DES. Such approvals shall be obtained in accordance
with Section 6.5 of the Regulations.

2.2 Building Sewers and Connections (Cont’d.)
T. If any Person shall fail or refuse, upon receipt of a notice of the Town, in writing, to remedy
any unsatisfactory condition with respect to a Building Sewer, within forty-five (45) days of
receipt of such notice, the Town of Londonderry may remedy any unsatisfactory condition
with respect to a Building Sewer and may collect from the Owner the costs and expenses
thereof by such legal proceedings as may be provided by law. The Town shall have full
authority to enter on the Owner's property to do whatever is necessary to remedy the
unsatisfactory condition.
Section 2.3 New Sewers or Sewer Extensions
A. New sanitary sewers and all extensions to sanitary sewers owned and maintained by the
Town shall be properly designed in accordance with the DES Administrate Rules Env-Wq
700 Standards of Design for Sewerage and Wastewater Treatment Facilities and in strict
conformance with all requirements of the DES. Plans and specifications shall be submitted
to, and approval obtained from, the Department of Public Works and the Town and the DES
before construction may proceed. The design of sewers shall anticipate and allow for flows
from all possible future extensions or developments within the immediate drainage area,
being compatible with the Wastewater Facilities Plan adopted by the Town, and as duly
amended.
B. When a property owner, builder, or developer proposes to construct sanitary sewers or
extensions to sanitary sewers in an area proposed for subdivision, the plans, specifications,
and method of installation shall be subject to the approval of the Department of Public
Works. Said property owner, builder or developer shall pay for the entire installation,
including appropriate share of the cost of treatment plant, intercepting or trunk sewers,
pumping stations, force mains and all other Town expenses incidental thereto based on
volume and plant capacity, as determined by the Town. Each building sewer shall be
installed and inspected pursuant to Section 2.2 and all application and inspection fees shall
be paid by the applicant. Design and installation of sewers shall be as specified in and in
conformance with paragraphs 3 through 6 of ASTM Specification C-12. Plugged service
wye fittings shall be provided along sewer extensions in locations approved by the
Department of Public Works to accommodate future connections from existing unimproved
lots. The installation of the sewer shall be subject to periodic inspection by the Department
of Public Works, and the expense for this inspection shall be paid for by the owner, builder,
or developer as provided in this local law. The Department of Public Works’ decisions shall
be final in matters of quality and methods of construction. The sewer, as constructed, must
pass an infiltration test approved by the Town before any building sewer is connected thereto.
Plans, specifications, and other required information shall be submitted 45 days in advance
of anticipated project start date. The Town shall be notified at least 30 days in advance of the
start of construction operations so that such inspection procedures as may be necessary or
required may be established. No sanitary sewers will be accepted by the Town until such

local law. Components and materials of POTW installations not covered in this Ordinance
such as pumping stations, lift stations, or force mains shall be designed in accordance with
paragraph 2.3(A) and shall be clearly shown and detailed on the plans and specifications
submitted for approval. When requested, the owner, builder, or developer of the proposed
installation shall submit to the Town all design calculations and other pertinent data to
supplement a review of the plans and specifications. Costs associated with the engineer’s
review of the plans and specifications, and any DES design review fees shall be paid by the
property owner, builder or developer.
Section 2.4 Variances
A. The Department of Public Works, with the approval of the Town Manager, may allow
reasonable variances from the provisions of Sections 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 of this Ordinance, which
will not result in a violation of State or federal law, provided:
1. The owner pays a variance fee of $100.00;
2. The variance allowed is the least variance reasonable;
3. The variance will not cause undue harm or inconvenience to the Town, the POTW, or
the owner's neighbors; and
4. The variance is justified by substantial reason.
B. The owner shall apply for the variance in writing to the Department of Public Works. The
application shall identify the name and address of the owner, the property in question, the
specific variance sought by the owner and a substantial reason justifying the variance. The
variance fee shall be paid with the application or the variance shall be deemed to have been
denied. The variance as issued shall identify any changes, limitations or restrictions on the
variance as applied for.
Section 2.5 Prohibited Discharge Standards

of connection to the sanitary sewer or other available monitoring location, or
otherwise causing corrosive structural damage or hazard to the POTW equipment, or
personnel, or with alkalinity in such quantities that the pH of the influent to the
POTW is caused to exceed 8.0 (NOTE: If the lower pH values of the untreated
wastewater range between 5.0 and 6.0, the Town may permit a pH range of 5.0 to
11.5 without the requirement for pretreatment, provided the Town determines that the
potential for adverse impact to the POTW is reasonably absent.);
3. Solid or viscous substances including water or wastes containing fats, wax, grease, or
oils, whether emulsified or not, or containing substances that may solidify or become
viscous at temperatures between thirty-two (32) and one hundred fifty (150) degrees
F (0-65 degrees C), in amounts that will cause obstruction of the flow in the POTW
resulting in interference;
4. Pollutants, including oxygen-demanding pollutants (BOD, COD, etc.), or chlorine
demand requirements released in a discharge at a flow rate and/or pollutant
concentration that, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants, will cause
interference with the POTW;
5. Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150ºF (65ºC), or which will inhibit
biological activity in the treatment plant resulting in interference, but in no case

foaming in the POTW;
7. Wastewater causing a reading on an explosion hazard meter at the point of discharge
into the POTW, or at any point in the POTW, of more than 10 percent (10%) of the
Lower Explosive Limit of the meter;
8. Garbage that has not been properly shredded to such a degree that all particles will be
transported freely under the flow conditions normally prevailing in public sewers
(garbage grinders may be connected to sanitary sewers from homes, hotels,
institutions, restaurants, hospitals, catering establishments, or similar places where
garbage originates from the preparation of food in kitchens for the purpose of
consumption on the premises or when served by caterers);
9. Any quantities of flow, concentrations, or both that constitute a "slug" as defined in
Section 1.4 of this Ordinance;
10. Waters or wastes that, by interaction with other water or wastes in the POTW, release
dangerous or noxious gases, form suspended solids that affect the operation of the
collection system, or create a condition deleterious to structures and treatment
processes; or
11. Any materials that exert or cause unusual concentrations of inert suspended solids
(such as, but not limited to, Fullers earth, lime, slurries, and lime residues) or of
dissolved solids (such as, but not limited to, sodium chloride and sodium sulfate).
2.6 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards
The categorical pretreatment standards are found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471
and are hereby incorporated into the Ordinance.
A. Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the
concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the Department of Public Works may impose
equivalent concentration or mass limitations in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).
B. When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater
not regulated by the same standard, the Department of Public Works shall impose an
alternate limit using the combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).
Town of Londonderry Rev. 1 – October 6, 1997
Title IV – Health, Safety & Welfare Ordinance 2007-02 – Rev. 2 –May 21, 2007
Title IV, Chapter IX, Page 29 of 50
CHAPTER IX – SEWER USE ORDINANCE
SECTION 2 GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS (Cont’d.)
2.6 Federal Categorical Pretreatment Standards (Cont’d.)
C. A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove,
pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating
to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when
developing the categorical pretreatment standard.
D. A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40
CFR 403.15.
The Town provides timely notification to appropriate industrial users of applicable categorical
pretreatment standards. Upon promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a
particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent than limitations imposed
under this Ordinance for sources in that subcategory, shall, on the compliance date of the categorical
pretreatment standards, immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this Ordinance.
Compliance with categorical pretreatment standards shall be achieved within three (3) years of the
date such standards are effective, unless a shorter compliance schedule is specified in the standards.
An industrial user subject to categorical pretreatment standards shall not discharge wastewater
directly or indirectly to the POTW subsequent to the compliance date of such standards unless an
amendment to its IDP has been issued by the Town.
2.7 Town's Right of Revision
The discharge standards and requirements set forth in Sections 2.5, 2.6, and the Regulations are
established for the purpose of preventing discharges to the POTWs that would harm the sewers,
wastewater treatment process, or equipment; would have an adverse effect on the receiving stream;
or would otherwise endanger lives, limb, public property, or constitute a nuisance.
To meet these objectives, the Department of Public Works may, from time to time, review and set
more stringent standards or requirements than those established in Sections 2.5, 2.6, and the
Regulations if, in the Department of Public Works opinion, such more stringent standards or
requirements are necessary. At a minimum, this review will be performed at least once every five
years. In forming this opinion, the Department of Public Works may give consideration to such
factors as the quantity of waste in relation to flows and velocities in the sewers, materials of
construction of the sewers, the wastewater treatment process employed, capacity of the wastewater
treatment facility, degree of treatability at the wastewater treatment facility, pollution prevention
activities, and other pertinent factors. The limitations or restrictions on materials or characteristics of
waste or wastewaters discharged to the sanitary sewer shall not be exceeded without the approval of
the Department of Public Works.

Title IV, Chapter IX, Page 30 of 50
CHAPTER IX – SEWER USE ORDINANCE
SECTION 2 GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS (Cont’d.)
2.7 Town's Right of Revision (Cont’d.)
The Department of Public Works shall allow affected industrial users reasonable time to comply
with any changes to the local limits. The conditions and schedule for compliance shall accompany
the written notification of amended local limits.
2.8 Dilution
No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way attempt to dilute a discharge, as a
partial or complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge
limitation unless expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. The
Department of Public Works may impose mass limitations on users who are using dilution to meet
applicable pretreatment standards or requirements, or in other cases when the imposition of mass
limitations is appropriate.
2.9 Mass-Based Limitations
Users implementing process changes may request that compliance be determined based on mass
limitations in lieu of concentration limitations. Such mass-based limitations will be calculated from
the permitted concentration-based limitations and flows, and shall be equivalent to or less than the
mass discharge in effect at the time of the request. The intent of a mass-based limit is to encourage
and allow pollution prevention and/or water conservation measures that might cause a facility to
increase pollutant concentrations in its discharge even though the total mass of the pollutant
discharged does not increase, and may in fact decrease. Decisions on granting requests for massbased
compliance limitations will be based on user-specific information and current operating
conditions of the POTW, and will be at the discretion of the Department of Public Works.
Implementation of mass-based limitations may not contravene any requirements of federal or State
laws and/or regulations implemented thereunder. For categorical Pretreatment Standards that are
expressed only in terms of pollutant concentrations, the Town may establish equivalent mass limits
only if the User meets all the conditions in 40 CFR 403.6 (c) (5).

SECTION 4 POWERS AND AUTHORITIES OF INSPECTORS
4.1 Compliance Monitoring
The Town shall investigate instances of noncompliance with the industrial pretreatment standards
and requirements.
The Town shall, as necessary, sample and analyze the wastewater discharges of contributing users
and conduct surveillance and inspection activities to identify, independently of information supplied
by such users, occasional and continuing noncompliance with industrial pretreatment standards.
Each industrial user will be billed directly for costs incurred for analysis of its wastewater.
4.2 Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling
All industrial users discharging to the POTW shall allow unrestricted access by Town representatives
for the POTW that treats the wastewater, and State and EPA personnel (“Inspector(s)”) for the
purpose of determining whether the user is complying with all requirements of this Ordinance and
Town Regulations, and any IDP or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the Inspector(s) ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination and
copying, and the performance of any additional duties.
A. If a user has security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with its security guards so
that, upon presentation of suitable identification, the Inspector(s) will be permitted to enter
without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities.
B. The Inspector(s) shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation of,
such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.
C. The Inspector(s) may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The
facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and
proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least annually to ensure accuracy.
Certification of equipment calibration shall be provided to the Town annually.
D. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be
inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal
request of the Inspector(s) and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall
be borne by the user.
E. Unreasonable delays in allowing the Inspector(s) access to the user's premises shall be a
violation of this Ordinance.

SECTION 4 POWERS AND AUTHORITIES OF INSPECTORS (Cont’d.)
4.2 Right of Entry: Inspection and Sampling (Cont’d.)
F. The Inspector(s) is authorized to obtain information concerning industrial processes that have
a bearing on the kind or source of discharge to the public sewer. The industrial user may
request that the information in question not be disclosed to the public in accordance with
Section 5 of this Ordinance. The information in question shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this Ordinance, the NPDES
permit, or the pretreatment program. The burden of proof that information should be held
confidential rests with the user. However, information regarding wastewater discharge by
the user (flow, constituents, concentrations, and characteristics) shall be available to the
public without restriction.
G. While performing the necessary work on private properties referred to in this Section, the
Inspector(s) shall observe all safety rules applicable to the premises established by the user.
The user shall be held harmless for injury or death to the Inspector(s), and the Town shall
indemnify the user against loss or damage to its property by Town employees and against
liability claims and demands for personal injury or property damage asserted against the user
and growing out of the monitoring activities, except as such may be caused by negligence or
failure of the user to maintain safe conditions.
H. The Inspector(s) shall be permitted to enter all private properties through which the Town
holds a duly negotiated easement for the purposes of, but not limited to, inspection,
observation, measurement, sampling, repair, and maintenance of any portion of the POTW
lying within said easement. All entry and subsequent work, if any, on said easement, shall be
done in full accordance with the terms of the duly negotiated easement pertaining to the
private property involved.
4.3 Search Warrants
If the Department of Public Works has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or
any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of
this Ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and
sampling program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this Ordinance or any permit or
order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community,
then the Department of Public Works may seek issuance of a search warrant from a court of proper

SECTION 5 CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION/PUBLIC PARTICIPATION
5.1 Confidential Information
Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, IDP Applications, IDPs, and
monitoring programs, and from the Department of Public Works inspection and sampling activities,
shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Department of Public Works, that the release of such
information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as
trade secrets under applicable State law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a
report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report that might disclose
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be
made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES
program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person providing
the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as defined by 40
CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public
without restriction.
5.2 Public Participation
The Town shall comply with the public participation requirements of 40 CFR Part 25 in the
enforcement of industrial pretreatment standards and requirements.

SECTION 6 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
6.1 Notification of Violation
When the Department of Public Works determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Ordinance and the Town's Regulations, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the Department of Public Works will serve a written
Notice of Violation to the user. Within the time period specified in the violation notice, an
explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to
include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Department of Public Works.
Submittal of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or
subsequent to receipt of the Notice of Violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of
the Department of Public Works to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without initially issuing a Notice of Violation.
6.2 Compliance Schedule Development
The Department of Public Works may require any user that has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to develop a compliance schedule. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section shall
meet the requirements set out in Section 6.2 of the Regulations.
6.3 Pollution Prevention Plan Development
The Department of Public Works may require any user that has violated or continues to violate any
provision of this Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to develop a pollution prevention plan in accordance with Section 3.4 of these
Regulations. The pollution prevention plan must specifically address violation(s) for which this
action was undertaken. The pollution prevention plan shall be developed using good engineering
judgment and shall be submitted to the Department of Public Works no later than sixty (60) days
after the user was notified of this requirement.
6.4 Publication of Users in Significant Noncompliance
The Department of Public Works will publish annually, in a newspaper(s) of general circulation that
provides meaningful public notice within the jurisdiction(s) served by the POTW, a list of the users
that, during the previous twelve (12) months, were in significant noncompliance, as defined in
Section 1.4, with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.
6.5 Show Cause Orders
The Department of Public Works may order a user that has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this Ordinance and the Town's Regulations, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or any
other pretreatment standard or requirement, to appear before the Department of Public Works and
Town of Londonderry Rev. 1 – October 6, 1997

show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the
user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for
such action, and a request that the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not
be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail
(return receipt requested) at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on
any authorized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or
prerequisite for, executing any other action against the user.
6.6 Cease and Desist Orders
When the Department of Public Works determines that a user has violated, or continues to violate,
any provision of this Ordinance and the Town's Regulations, an IDP or order issued hereunder, or
any other pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur,
the Department of Public Works may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all
such violations and directing the user to:
A. Immediately comply with all requirements; and
B. Implement such appropriate remedial or preventive action as may be needed to properly
address a continuing or threatened violation, including halting operations and/or terminating
the discharge.
Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.
6.7 Consent Orders
The Department of Public Works is hereby empowered to enter into Consent Orders, assurances of
voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user
responsible for noncompliance. Such orders shall include specific action to be taken by the user to
correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Orders may also contain
such other requirements as might be reasonably necessary and appropriate to address the
noncompliance, including the installation of pretreatment systems, additional self-monitoring, and
management practices. Such orders shall have the same force and effect as administrative orders
issued pursuant to Sections 6.5 and 6.6 of this Ordinance and shall be judicially enforceable.
6.8 Industrial Discharge Permit Termination

CHAPTER IX – SEWER USE ORDINANCE
SECTION 6 ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES
6.10 Emergency Suspensions
The Department of Public Works may immediately suspend a user's discharge, subsequent to
informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to terminate an actual or
threatened discharge that reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial
endangerment to the health or welfare of POTW personnel or the public. The Department of Public
Works may also immediately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that
threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or that presents, or may present, an
endangerment to the environment.
A. Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately terminate or eliminate its
wastewater discharge. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply with the
suspension order, the Department of Public Works may implement such steps as deemed
necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent or minimize
damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The
Department of Public Works may allow the user to recommence its discharge when the user
has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Department of Public Works that the period of
endangerment has passed, unless the termination proceedings in Section 6.8 or 6.9 of this
Ordinance are initiated against the user.
B. A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any discharge presenting imminent
endangerment shall submit a detailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful
contribution and the measures implemented to prevent any future occurrence, to the
Department of Public Works prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under
Sections 6.5,6.8 or 6.9 of this Ordinance.
Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency suspension
under this section.
6.11 Recovery of Expenses
Any person or industrial user violating any of the provisions of this Ordinance shall be liable to the
Town for any expense, loss, or damage occasioned the Town or the POTWs by reason of such
violation. If the Department of Public Works or Town shall have caused the disconnection of a drain
from a public sewer, the Town may collect the expenses associated with completing the
disconnection from any person or user responsible for, or willfully concerned in, or who profited by
such violation. The Town may thereafter refuse to permit the restoration of the former connection or
of any new connection to the property concerned in the violation until the claim of the Town for the
cost of completing such disconnection shall have been paid in full plus interest and the reasonable
cost of any legal expenses incurred by the Town in connection therewith.

Ordinance, an IDP, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the
Town may petition the Rockingham County Superior Court through the Town's Attorney for the
issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate, that restrains or compels the
specific performance of the IDP, order, or other requirement imposed by this Ordinance or by Town
Regulations on activities of the user. The Town may also seek such other action as is appropriate for
legal and/or equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to conduct environmental
remediation. A petition for injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for,
implementing any other action against a user.

of the violation.
B. The Town may recover reasonable attorneys' fees, court costs, and other expenses associated
with enforcement activities, including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any
actual damages incurred by the Town. The Town shall petition the Court to impose, assess,
and recover such sums.
C. In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall consider all relevant
circumstances, including, but not limited to, the extent of harm caused by the violation, the
magnitude and duration of the violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's
violation, corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any other
factor as justice requires.
D. Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, implementing
any other action against a user.
7.3 Criminal Prosecution
Any person or industrial user who willfully or negligently violates any provision of this Ordinance or
any orders or permits issued hereunder shall, upon conviction, be guilty of a violation, punishable by
a fine not to exceed $10,000 for each violation. Every separate provision violated shall constitute a
separate violation. Every day that a violation occurs shall be deemed a separate violation. Ref. RSA

CHAPTER IX – SEWER USE ORDINANCE
SECTION 9 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS
9.1 Upset
A. For the purposes of this section, “upset” means an exceptional incident in which there is
unintentional and temporary noncompliance with pretreatment standards due to factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include noncompliance to the
extent caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities, inadequate
treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless or improper operation.
B. An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action brought for noncompliance with
pretreatment standards if the requirements of paragraph (C), below, are met.
C. A user who intends to establish the affirmative defense of upset shall demonstrate, through
properly signed, contemporaneous operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:
1. An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s) of the upset;
2. At the time being of the upset, the facility was operated in a prudent and workmanlike
manner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance
procedures; and
3. The user has submitted the following information to the Department of Public Works
within twenty-four (24) hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is
provided orally, a written submission must be provided within five (5) days):
a. A description of the discharge and cause of noncompliance;
b. The period of noncompliance, including exact dates and times or, if not
corrected, the amount of time the noncompliance is expected to continue; and
c. Action being implemented and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent
recurrence of the noncompliance.
D. In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall
have the burden of proof.
E. Users will have the opportunity for a judicial determination on any claim of upset only in an
enforcement action brought for noncompliance with pretreatment standards.
F. Users shall control all discharges to the extent necessary to maintain compliance with
pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the
facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided. This requirement
applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the
treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

CHAPTER IX – SEWER USE ORDINANCE
SECTION 9 AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS (Cont’d.
9.2 Prohibited Discharge Standards
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for
noncompliance with the general prohibitions in Section 2.5(A) of this Ordinance or the specific
prohibitions in Sections 2.5(B) of this Ordinance if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason
to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would cause
pass through or interference and that either:
A. A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compliance with each
limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or
B. No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or constituents
from the user's prior discharge when the POTW was regularly in compliance with its NPDES
permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use or
disposal requirements.
9.3 Bypass
A. For the purposes of this section,
1. “Bypass” means the intentional diversion of waste streams from any portion of a
user's treatment facility.
2. “Severe property damage” means substantial physical damage to property, damage to
the treatment facilities that causes them to become inoperable, or substantial and
permanent loss of natural resources that can reasonably be expected to occur in the
absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused
by delays in production.
B. A user may allow any bypass to occur that does not cause pretreatment standards or
requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient
operation. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of paragraphs (C) and (D) of this
section.
C. 1. If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the
Department of Public Works and to the POTW providing treatment, at least ten (10)
days before the date of the bypass, if possible.
2. A user shall submit oral notice to the Department of Public Works of an
unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment standards within twentyfour
(24) hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. A written submission
shall also be provided within five (5) days of the time the user becomes aware of the
bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its

cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass
has not been corrected, the amount of time it is expected to continue; and steps
implemented or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass.
The Department of Public Works may waive the written report on a case-by-case
basis if the oral report has been received within twenty-four (24) hours.
D. 1. Bypass is prohibited, and the Department of Public Works may initiate enforcement
action against a user for a bypass, unless:
a. Bypass was required to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property
damage;
b. There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary
treatment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during
normal periods of equipment downtime. This condition is not satisfied if
adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of
reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a bypass that occurred during
normal periods of equipment downtime or preventive maintenance; and
c. The user submitted notices as required under paragraph (C) of this section.
2. The Department of Public Works may approve an anticipated bypass, subsequent to
considering its adverse effects, if the Department of Public Works determines that it
will meet the three conditions listed in paragraph (D)(1) of this section.

ORDINANCE
INTRODUCTION
Pursuant to enabling authority in New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated 149-I:6; RSA
Chapter 147, or revisions thereto, the following is a set of Regulations for the use of public and
private sewers, private wastewater disposal, the installation and connection of building sewers,
and the discharge of waters and wastes into the public sewer system, in the Town of
Londonderry, County of Rockingham, State of New Hampshire.
SECTION 1 GENERAL PROVISIONS
1.1 Purpose and Policy
These Regulations set forth uniform requirements for users of the Londonderry Municipal Sewer
System which transports wastewater to the Publicly Owned Treatment Works (POTW) in
Manchester and Derry and enables the Town to comply with all applicable State and federal
laws, including the Clean Water Act (33 United States Code § 1251 et seq.) and the General
Pretreatment Regulations (40 Code of Federal Regulations Part 403). The Town is also subject
to the provisions of the Intermunicipal Agreement with the City of Manchester, dated May 24,
1979, (as amended) and the Intermunicipal Agreement with the Town of Derry, dated July 10,
1981 (as amended). Recognizing that significant opportunities exist to reduce or prevent
pollution at its source through cost effective practices, and that such practices can offer savings
through reduced purchases of materials and resources, a decreased need for pollution control
technologies, and lower liability costs, as well as assisting to protect the environment, the Town
establishes the following objectives of these Regulations:
A. To promote, consistent with the policy of the federal government:
· The prevention or reduction of pollutants at the source whenever feasible;
· Recycling in an environmentally-safe manner when pollution cannot be
prevented;
· Treatment in an environmentally-safe manner of pollution that cannot be
prevented or recycled; and
· Disposal or other release into the environment in an environmentally-safe manner
only as a last resort.
To encourage the development of these efforts, the Town may:
· Set Town-wide pollution prevention goals;
· Organize an assessment program task force;
· Review data and inspect sites;
· Develop pollution prevention options;
· Conduct a feasibility analysis of selected options; and
· Promote implementation of pollution prevention techniques.

SECTION 2 GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS
2.1 Local Discharge Restrictions
All users discharging industrial process wastes into public or private sewers connected to the
POTW shall comply with applicable federal requirements and State standards for pretreatment of
wastes as they may be amended from time to time in addition to the requirements of these
Regulations.
Local numerical discharge limitations established by the Town as set forth herein (referred to as
"local limits"), and all State pretreatment standards and categorical pretreatment standards shall
apply, whichever is most stringent.
If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the POTW that exceed
the standards or restrictions established in Sections 2.5, and 2.6, of the Ordinance, which in the
judgment of the Department of Public Works may have a deleterious effect upon the POTW,
processes, equipment, or receiving waters, or that otherwise create a hazard to worker safety or
health, or constitute a public nuisance, the Department of Public Works may:
· Reject or prevent any discharge to the POTW after notice has been served to the
discharger and the discharger has had reasonable opportunity to respond;
· Require pretreatment prior to discharge to the POTW (see Section 3 of these
Regulations);
· Require control (e.g., equalization) over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or
· Require payment to cover additional cost of handling and treating the wastes.
If the Department of Public Works allows the pretreatment or equalization of waste flows, the
design and installation of the systems and equipment shall be subject to the review and approval
of the Department of Public Works and the State (see Section 3).

zinc present in the municipal water supply. Best Management Practices will be
required limiting the addition of zinc to wastewater discharges as an alternative to
enforcement of a numerical value.
All mass loading limitations for metals represent total metals, regardless of the valance
state, or the physical or chemical form of the metal. To administer these allowable
loadings through IDPs, the Department of Public Works may impose concentration-based
limitations, or mass limitations in accordance with Section 2.7 of the Ordinance. For
industrial users, the values written into IDPs for the above pollutants shall apply at the end
of the industrial wastestream and prior to dilution with non-industrial wastewaters.
Unless specifically identified in an IDP, an industrial user is not allowed to discharge the
locally limited pollutants at concentrations significantly greater than background

B. Screening Levels. Screening levels are numerical values above which actions are initiated
to evaluate, prevent or reduce adverse impacts on the POTW, the environment, and/or
human health and safety. The Town monitors industrial sources of conservative
pollutant-bearing discharges in comparison to established screening levels, and
authorization to discharge at greater concentrations may be granted subject to the
administrative procedures for managing mass loading limitations. Screening level values
for conservative pollutants will be maintained by the Town, independent of these
Regulations, to provide regulatory flexibility.
Screening levels for non-conservative pollutants are concentration-based values that, if
exceeded, represent a potential to compromise worker safety, create flammability or
chemical reactivity conditions in the collection system, or result in operational issues
such as excessive organic/solids loadings. Screening levels for non-conservative
pollutants are developed as needed using the methodology of the Town. The data in the
following table are representative of non-conservative pollutants and the concentrations
above which they shall not be discharged to the POTW without approval of the

If any of the screening levels are exceeded, repeat analysis may be required by the
Department of Public Works to verify compliance or noncompliance with that screening
level. If noncompliance is indicated, then the industrial user may be required, at the
discretion of the Department of Public Works, to conduct an appropriate engineering
evaluation at the industrial user’s expense to determine the potential impact of the
discharge of this pollutant to the POTW or alternatively, to develop a pollution
prevention plan specifically addressing the pollutant that exceeds the screening level.
This study or plan shall be approved by the Department of Public Works. Should the
evaluation indicate the impact to be unsatisfactory, the industrial user shall reduce the
pollutant concentration to a satisfactory level. If the evaluation supports development of
an alternate site-specific limitation, then the screening level may, at the discretion of the
Department of Public Works, be adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user
and administered as a permit limitation for the specific discharge. If an industrial user
proposes to discharge at concentrations greater than the concentration-based screening
level, then the industrial user may be required to conduct the evaluations described in the
previous paragraph. Should the evaluations support an alternate site-specific limitation,
then the screening level may, at the discretion of the Department of Public Works, be
adjusted as a special agreement for the industrial user and administered as a permit
limitation for the specific discharge.
C. Best Management Practices. The Town may develop Best Management Practices (BMPs)
to implement Section 2.5 or the Ordinance and this Section of the Regulations. Such
BMPs shall be considered local limits and Pretreatment Standards for the purposes of

arrangement between the Town and any industrial user whereby an industrial waste of
unusual strength or character may be accepted by the Town for treatment provided that
said agreements do not contravene any requirements of existing federal or State laws,
and/or regulations promulgated thereunder, are compatible with any user charge system
in effect, and do not waive applicable federal categorical pretreatment standards. Special
agreement requests shall require submittal of a pollution prevention plan that specifically
addresses the discharge for which a special agreement is requested. For pollutants with
numerical local limits, the Town has allocated a percentage of its allowable industrial
loadings for such special agreements. Requests for special agreements that exceed this
allocation will not be approved.
SECTION 3 PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER
3.1 Pretreatment Facilities
Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with these Regulations and
shall achieve compliance with all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, prohibitions,
and requirements set out in Sections 2.5 and 2.6 of the Ordinance as well as these Regulations
within the time limitations specified by EPA, the State, or the Department of Public Works,
whichever is more stringent. All facilities required to achieve and maintain compliance shall be
provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed plans describing such
facilities and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Department of Public Works for
review, and shall be acceptable to the Department of Public Works and the DES before such
facilities are constructed. The review of such plans and operating procedures shall in no way
relieve the user from the responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the Town under the provisions of the Ordinance and these Regulations.
Plans and specifications for a proposed pretreatment facility shall be the result of the design of a
professional engineer licensed by the State of New Hampshire.
3.2 Additional Pretreatment Measures
A. Whenever deemed necessary to protect the POTW and determine the user's compliance
with the requirements of the Ordinance and these Regulations, the Department of Public
Works may require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate
that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate and/or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sanitary sewage waste streams from industrial
waste streams, and such other conditions as may be necessary.

interception units shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Department of Public
Works and shall be so located to be easily accessible for cleaning and inspection by the
owner and the Town. Such interceptors shall be inspected, cleaned, and repaired
regularly, as needed, by the user at their expense. The owner shall be responsible for the
proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured materials and shall
maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which shall be subject to periodic
review by the Department of Public Works. Any removal and hauling of the collected
materials shall be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms.
D. Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may be required to install and
maintain an approved combustible gas detection meter and alarm.
E. Where pretreatment or flow equalizing facilities are provided or required for any waters
or wastes, these devices shall be maintained continuously to ensure satisfactory and
effective operation by the owner at his expense.
F. The owner of any building serviced by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes may, at
the discretion of the Department of Public Works, be required to install a suitable control
manhole or approved equivalent structure together with such necessary meters and other
appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling and measurement of
the wastes. Such manhole shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in
accordance with plans approved by the Town. The manhole shall be installed at the
owner’s expense and shall be maintained by the owner so as to be safe and accessible at all
times. The owner shall perform such monitoring as the Town may reasonably require
including installation, use and maintenance of monitoring equipment, maintaining records
and reporting the results of such monitoring to the Town. Such records shall be made
available to the Town, upon its request.

3.3 Accidental Discharge/Slug Control Plans
At least once, and as required by changing conditions, the Department of Public Works shall
evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental discharge/slug control plan
or other action to control Slug Discharges. The Department of Public Works may require any
user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan. Alternatively, the Department
of Public Works may develop such a plan for any user. Review and approval of such plans and
operating procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his
facility as necessary to meet the requirements of these Regulations. An accidental discharge/slug
control plan shall address, at a minimum, the following:
A. Description of discharge practices, including non-routine batch discharges;
B. Description of stored chemicals;
C. Procedures for immediately notifying the Department of Public Works of any accidental
or slug discharge, as required by Section 6.6 of these Regulations; and
D. Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or slug discharge. Such
procedures include, but are not limited to, inspection and maintenance of storage areas,
handling and transfer of materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site
runoff, worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures for
containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and/or measures and equipment
for emergency response.
3.4 Pollution Prevention Plans
In accordance with the provisions of Section 2.1 of these Regulations and Section 6.3 of the
Ordinance, the Department of Public Works may require any person discharging wastes into the
POTW to develop and implement, at that person’s own expense, a pollution prevention plan.
The Department of Public Works may require users to submit as part of the pollution prevention
plan information that demonstrates adherence to the following elements:
A. Management Support. For changes to be effective, the visible support of top
management is required. Management's support should be explicitly stated and include
designation of a pollution prevention coordinator, goals, and time frames for reductions
in volume and toxicity of waste streams, and procedures for employee training and
involvement.
B. Process Characterization. A detailed process waste diagram shall be developed that
identifies and characterizes the input of raw materials, the outflow of products, and the
generation of wastes.

each process. This may include establishing and maintaining waste accounting systems
to track sources, the rates and dates of generation, and the presence of hazardous
constituents.
D. Analysis of Waste Management Economics. Waste management economic returns shall
be determined based on the consideration of:
1. Reduced raw material purchases;
2. Avoidance of waste treatment, monitoring and disposal costs;
3. Reductions in operations and maintenance expenses;
4. Elimination of permitting fees and compliance costs; and
5. Reduced liabilities for employee/public exposure to hazardous chemicals and
cleanup of waste disposal sites.
E. Development of Pollution Prevention Alternatives. Current and past pollution prevention
activities should be assessed, including estimates of the reduction in the amount and
toxicity of waste achieved by the identified actions. Opportunities for pollution
prevention must then be assessed for identified processes where raw materials become or
generate wastes. Technical information on pollution prevention should be solicited and
exchanged, both from inside the organization and out.
F. Evaluation and Implementation. Technically and economically feasible pollution
prevention opportunities shall be identified and an implementation timetable with interim
and final milestones shall be developed. The recommendations that are implemented
shall be periodically reviewed for effectiveness.
The review and approval of such pollution prevention plans by the Town shall in no way relieve
the user from the responsibilities of modifying facilities as necessary to produce a discharge
acceptable to the Town in accordance with the provisions of the Ordinance and these

CHAPTER X - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN
SECTION I PURPOSE
The purpose of this Emergency Management Plan (“Plan”) is to make each organization
and department aware of its responsibility in all-hazard emergency operations. This plan,
upon being implemented by the community government, will provide the basis for
coordinating protective actions prior to, during and after any type of disaster. It was
prepared to conform to guidelines established by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
and the New Hampshire Emergency Management Agency and is in concert with the state
of New Hampshire Emergency Management Plan. The Chairman of the Town Council,
hereafter known as the “Chairman” shall inform the public of the existence of said Plan.
SECTION II AUTHORITIES
Authority for this Plan and Annexes is contained in U.S. Public Laws 81-920 and 93-288,
as amended, the State of New Hampshire Revised Statutes Annotated, as amended, and
applicable local ordinances. By local charter, the Chairman is responsible for all
emergency operations in the community and has the authority to appoint an Emergency
Management Director, delegating said person with the power to establish a Emergency
Management organization to carry out the various phases of the emergency plan.
Operations under this plan will commence on orders of the Emergency Management
Director, or his/her designee, in the event of an imminent or existing emergency situation.
SECTION III SITUATION
A. The Town of Londonderry is in Rockingham County situated in the southeastern part of
New Hampshire. It is primarily a residential community with a population of
approximately 23,243 people in 42.2 square miles. Due to the availability of land,
Londonderry has grown rapidly in recent years. There is some light industry and an
increasing number of small-to-medium-sized shopping centers have been and are being
constructed. A five-person Town Council, one of whose members serves as Chairman,
governs Londonderry. The Council employs a Town Manager who has certain authority
by Town Charter.
B. The Town Council has appointed an Emergency Management Director to
coordinate planning, preparation, mitigation and response efforts to emergencies
in the town. The Town has full-time Police, Fire and Public Works Departments
and is served by three water and two sewer systems. The community has one
centrally located Police facility and three area fire stations. Londonderry enjoys a
mutual aid compact with twenty-two neighboring towns and cities and is a
member of the Southern New Hampshire Regional Planning Commission, the
Border Area Fire Mutual Aid Association, and the Southeastern New Hampshire
Hazardous Materials Mutual Aid District.

SECTION VIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Communications
A. Purpose - The purpose of this Annex will be the assignment of responsibilities
and establishment of procedures to expand the routine communications system
into an emergency command and control network
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are contained in Section II -
Authorities. In addition, the communications systems are licensed by and
conform to regulations of the Federal Communications Commission.
C. Situation
1. The Fire, Police and Public Works departments currently maintain radio
networks for conducting day-to-day operations. These departments have
base stations and mobiles for dispatching field forces and interfacing with
other systems, both regional mutual aid and state agencies.
2. These local networks, by necessity, must form the basis for an emergency
communications system. In addition, telephones will be utilized as long as
those systems are in operation. If needed and available, amateur radio and
citizen's band networks may be used to augment the existing
communications capability.
3. Major emergencies probably will generate an extra-ordinary demand on
all communications systems so priority usage must be given to state and
local direction and control networks and the Emergency Broadcast System
(EBS). Residential telephone usage must be severely curtailed to prevent
system breakdown and line-load control, the prioritized shutdown of
telephone service, must be established in order that emergency services
may use the system for as long as possible.
4. An atmospheric nuclear explosion will create a power surge, called
Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP), which would probably disable unprotected
communications systems through a wide area. Since it cannot be
determined in advance which systems may remain in operation, expedient
alternatives may have to be developed at the time of crisis. None of the
communications networks in Londonderry are protected against EMP.
D. Organization - The Emergency Communications Committee will consist of:
Police Chief
Fire Chief
Public Works Director
Chief Dispatchers of each Department
Emergency Management Director

Department and its methods of coordination with other departments and agencies in time
of emergency.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in II - Authorities.
C. Situation - The fire suppression functions include fire safety, fire surveillance and
reporting procedures and fire fighting for all types of fires.

by a full-time chief and is as well-equipped to, perform its assigned
functions as any community of comparable size. It is a member of the
border Area Fire Mutual Aid System. The Fire Station does have
emergency power.
2. The Fire Department is the largest single source of manpower in the
community, but, in a major emergency, it would probably need additional
personnel and equipment to perform all of its assigned tasks. Due to the
nature and size of the emergency, mutual aid assistance may be
unavailable or severely limited, so expedient measures may have to be
developed at the time of crisis.
3. The Fire Department is usually the first responder to a hazardous material
incident and has written procedures for these incidents. The department
conducts on-going training programs in hazardous materials. The senior
fire officer present assumes on-scene command.
4. In the event of an actual nuclear attack, major firestorms can be expected
in the immediate ground zero area for a radius of five to ten miles. Fire
fighting activity in these areas will, of necessity, be confined to the outer
perimeter of the ground zero area to contain damage within the area and
prevent the spread of fire to otherwise undamaged areas.
5. The Fire Department maintains Standard Operating Procedures (SOPS) for
fire suppression and regularly trains its personnel in those procedures and
coordination with other emergency services is standard procedure.
D. Organization - Delegation of authority within the department is through
the normal chain of command:
Chief
Deputy Chief
Captain

SECTION XIV FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Evacuation
A. Purpose - The purpose of this Annex is to establish procedures for the
orderly movement of people from endangered or stricken area; to facilities in
areas generally unaffected by the disaster or potentially safer from an impending
emergency situation.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Part II -
Authorities.
C. Situation
1. An organized evacuation of potentially endangered
populations is one protective action and should be recommended only
when other protective actions appear to be inadequate. An evacuation
may be recommended when all or any part of the community is affected
and may involve all or any portion of the population.
2. Areas in Londonderry that might require an evacuation to
be recommended would include:
a. Designated flood plains and areas subjected to riverine
flooding due to ice jams
b. Areas around a potentially explosive hazardous materials
accident
c. Areas downwind of a hazardous chemical materials
accident
d. Areas in and around hazardous materials waste disposal
dumps
e. Areas determined by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency (FEMA) to be potential targets of an enemy attack
f. Areas subjected to outages of power, water or home heating
materials
g. Structures, which are or could, become unsound due to
fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes and other major natural or
technological phenomena
h. Areas around or near crashed aircraft
3. By state law, RSA 107, the Governor of New Hampshire
may only recommend evacuation as being in the best interest of the safety
and welfare of the citizens. On-scene commanders and local officials may
recommend evacuation in local emergency situations. Any evacuation,
unless specifically recommended and assisted by federal, state or local
TOWN OF LONDONDERRY Adopted 4/15/02
Title IV - Public Health, Safety, Welfare Revised 4/26/02

government officials, does not bind that government to be liable for
damages incurred. It is assumed that the officials at all levels of
government have fully assessed the risks involved before recommending
an evacuation.
4. Although most adults in Londonderry own or have use of a
private vehicle and would evacuate using that vehicle, the Town assisted
by state government will provide school busses and available commercial
vehicles to transport those who do not own or have use of a vehicle or who
cannot ride with friends, relatives or neighbors. When faced with a
potential life-threatening situation, people will generally follow three
options.

time of emergency and on a case-by-case basis.
8. Prisoners being held by the Police Department who could
not be released would be transferred for incarceration.
9. During a period of increasing international tension, the
Presidential option of relocating people from potential target areas to

SECTION XV FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Resource Management
A. Purpose - The purpose of this Annex is to provide guidelines for the most
effective use of resources during and after an emergency situation through
regulation and/or conservation, through pre-crisis identification of local resources
and through augmentation from outside sources.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Section
II - Authorities
C. Situation -
1. The Town of Londonderry will require such resources as are necessary to
maintain essential industries and services, to support key personnel
working within these facilities and to provide the citizens, both affected
and unaffected by the emergency, with at least austere levels of essential
survival resources such as food, water, housing, medical care, fire and
police protection, etc.
a. Distribution patterns will be altered as much
as possible to provide these essential resources.
b. If possible, the stockpiling of as much
essential materials as possible will begin during pre-crisis periods
on instructions of the State Emergency Management Agency.
c. The nature of the emergency might be such
that the community would have to survive for an extended period
of time on those resources available until outside assistance can be
obtained. Therefore, rationing may become a necessity.
Eventually, outside assistance will become available from federal,
state or regional sources.
2. Generally, people will cooperate with official regulations
restricting the use of essential resources during an emergency. State Law,
RSA 107, provides that private property may be commandeered or
appropriated for the common good. Owners will be reimbursed as soon as
practical following the end of the emergency situation.
3. Control of both inter- and intrastate transport of resources
must be placed with Federal and State government agencies.
4. Should the emergency situation warrant an evacuation of
the major portion of the population, those resources deemed in excess to
the needs of Londonderry would be transferred to the hosting community.
D. Organization - The Emergency Resource Management Committee shall
consist of the following:
Chairman, Town Council
Manager
Emergency Management Director
Health Officer
Public Works Director

SECTION XVI FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Health And Medical
A. Purpose - The purpose of this Annex is to establish guidelines for providing
health and medical care to casualties and survivors of a major disaster situation.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Section II -
Authorities.
C. Situation
1. The Town of Londonderry has two (2) health clinics which would require
emergency planning. However, people must rely on facilities in
Manchester or Derry to provide most advanced medical services. There
are physicians, registered nurses and licensed practical nurses residing in
the community who could be used to augment the medical capability in
addition to volunteers with first-aid training.
2. A major emergency affecting the community and the surrounding area
could result in a high rate of casualties and fatalities. A temporary morgue
will be established at the Junior High School. There are no
mortuaries/cold storage facilities available for temporary storage of
corpses.
3. There is a full-time health officer who is available at all times. Guidance
in health matters in an emergency is available from the State Division of
Public Health.
4. Since no judgment can be made as to the health and medical capabilities
which would survive a major emergency, certain expedient medical
decisions will be made following an assessment of the capabilities
remaining. Should the emergency require that a major evacuation be
recommended, service for health facilities would be reduced for the period
of time necessary to discontinue service, move to a host area and
reestablish limited service. Health facilities located in the host areas
would have to be expanded to allow for increased demand. Those patients
whose needs can reasonably be deferred would be evaluated and
discharged.
5. Because of the fluctuation in numbers and types of patients, certain
decisions can only be made at the time of the emergency. Any privatelyowned
and operated health facilities will remain under the control of their
regular management.

1. The Health Officer will:
a. Coordinate all health and medical functions
b. Assess the medical capabilities on-hand and
report these to the Manager
c. Establish medical Procedures for evacuees
at the shelter(s)
d. Establish procedures for evacuating

c. Report any excess medical capacity, which may be
available
3. The Emergency Management Director will:
a. Assist the Health Officer in coordinating medical functions
b. Coordinate with health facilities on the release of names of
casualties
F. Concept of Operations
1. The community has a responsibility to provide Medical
treatment for casualties caused by a disaster situation and to provide
procedures for the handling of fatalities. Hospitals, which have a mass
casualty plan, will invoke it in concert with this plan.
2. In the post-disaster period, potential threats to human
health such as contaminated water, could be possible and, therefore, the
public must be alerted to them and the procedures necessary for
safeguarding health.
3. Because of the vagaries of natural and man-made disasters,
many decisions will have to be made at the time of the incident based on
an expedient capability assessment and the availability of medical
TOWN OF LONDONDERRY Adopted 4/15/02

41
resources. These decisions must be made on the best advice and
recommendations available to the Health Officer and Manager. Federal
and state officials will assist in the decision-making process.

SECTION XVII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Shelter and Feeding
A. Purpose - The purpose of this Annex is to provide guidelines for
sheltering and feeding evacuees and assigning responsibilities for it.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Section
II - Authorities
C. Situation
1. The recommendation to evacuate people at risk during an
emergency situation automatically requires that shelter spaces be made
available and feeding operations for evacuees begin. Generally, schools
and churches provide the best shelter facilities since they combine the
shelter spaces with the capability for mass feeding. Other potential
shelters would include community centers, armories, town halls and
service clubs.
2. There are five (5) schools and ten (10) churches in the
town, which, if unaffected by the emergency situation, could provide
shelter space for its evacuees or a like number from an affected
community nearby. If these buildings were affected, evacuees must be
sheltered in another community.
3. Based on National Shelter Survey (NSS) data, there are two
(2) buildings identified as providing shelter spaces for protection against
radioactive fallout. However, there are other buildings that could be
expediently up-graded to provide fallout protection. In the case of an
attack without warning, the population would be advised to seek shelter in
the best available facility. Most private homes have basements in which
residents could seek shelter from radioactive fallout.
4. A percentage of homeowners would voluntarily provide
shelter and feeding to evacuees. However, human nature precludes
identification prior to an emergency.
5. Food supplies for shelterees will be provided from local
stocks, Red Cross supplies and/or by the shelterees themselves.
6. The Emergency Broadcast System (EBS) will be the
primary means of advising people to seek shelter.
D. Organization - The shelter organization will consist of:

SECTION XVIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Emergency Public Information
A. Purpose - The purpose of this Annex is to establish guidelines for the
analysis, preparation and dissemination of timely and factual information and
instructions to the public by responsible officials.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Section
II, Authorities, and the State of New Hampshire Emergency Broadcast System
Plan.
C. Situation
1. The citizens of Londonderry will require and respond to
timely and factual information and instructions during all phases of an
emergency situation precrisis, crisis and post crisis released by official
sources. Detailed and factual information and instructions that are well
presented can reduce the incidence of panic among the threatened
population.
2. Because of the complexities in the different types of
disaster, most emergency information and instruction to the public must be
prepared and released at the time of occurrence. To avoid confusing and
misleading statements, there should be a single media contact person. Also
a method of handling rumors should be established to avoid
misinformation being spread.
3. The Governor and the State Emergency Management
Agency will provide the lead in issuing emergency information and
instructions through the Emergency Broadcast System (EBS). However,
authorized local officials can activate the local EBS for those emergencies
that are local in scope.
4. Four (4) radio stations, (WDER, WKBR, WFEA and
WGIR), two (2) daily newspapers, (the Union Leader and the Nashua
Telegraph), and two (2) weeklies, (The Derry News and the Nashua
Telegraph), serve the community. Television stations WMUR and
WNDS, and Adelphia Cable System provide TV coverage. Most families
have access to local area electronic and print media.
5. Because of the possible impact on Londonderry, local
officials also need to be informed of events happening outside the
community.
D. Organization - The Emergency Public Information organization shall consist of
the Manager and the Emergency Management Director with input from all
emergency response services.

CHAPTER X - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN (Cont’d
SECTION XVIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Emergency Public Information
E. Responsibilities:
1. The Manager and/or Chairman will
a. Act as the primary contact person for the media unless
he/she designates someone else to disseminate emergency information and instructions to
the public
b. Authorize the activation of the local area EBS
2. The Emergency Management Director will
a. Gather and analyze all public information and instructions
b. Prepare news releases for the Manager
c. Arrange regular media briefings by the Manager
d. Establish an emergency media center, if necessary
e. Establish a rumor control system
3. All department heads and on-scene commanders will
a. Refer media questions to the EOC And/or the Media Center
as much as possible
F. Concept of Operations
1. In order that the public is informed of the emergency situation as
soon as possible, the Manager must receive an assessment of the situation
and the recommended protective actions. This information should be
prepared for release to the public through the local media in a timely
manner. Subsequent informational and instructional bulletins should be
issued as the situation warrants.
2. The establishment of a rumor control center or phone number is
most important so that misinformation can be dispelled as soon as possible
before it can spread and possibly cause panic among the general public.
The phone number(s) must be well publicized and manned by
knowledgeable people. Rumor control will be established at Town Office,
Phone Number 432-1120.
3. The media must be made aware of the single-source concept for
news and information and know that they will be given the whole story.
Most media people will follow this concept as it relieves them of getting a
fragmented news item. The local media should be contacted as soon as
possible to relay numbers and/or locations where the media contact person
would be available.

SECTION XIX FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Recovery
A. Purpose -The purpose of this Annex is to provide guidelines in order that the
community and its citizens can recover from the effects of a disaster as rapidly as
possible through its own initiative and with State and/or Federal assistance.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Section
II - Authorites.
C. Situation
1. The length of the recovery period will vary depending on
the type and magnitude of the disaster and the community may have to
begin recovery operations without assistance for an indefinite period until
State and/or Federal assistance becomes available. Help from State and/or
Federal sources would become available when and if the community's
capability to perform the necessary recovery operations is exceeded.
However, in spite of the completeness of recovery operations,
Londonderry could not expect to return to predisaster normality either
physically, economically or mentally.
2. Manpower, equipment and supplies are the tools necessary
to accomplish the recovery operations and an indeterminate number of
people and amounts of equipment and supplies would probably survive
any type of disaster. The citizens would probably agree to help each other
voluntarily. If unaffected by the disaster, this community would assist, to
the best of its capabilities, affected communities to recover.
3. Priority in recovery operations must be given to providing
the survivors with shelter, food, water, medical treatment, clothing and
sanitation facilities. Restoration of communications capabilities must also
be accorded a high priority. Contaminated areas must be secured from
entry until the State Division of Public Health deems these areas safe.
Instructions on the use or non-use of contaminated foods and/or water will
be disseminated.
4. Damage assessment, economic impact and human needs
reports should be completed as soon as possible so that the Federal
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) may adjudge the criteria for
Federal disaster assistance. The State Emergency Management Agency
would help the community to apply for various federal disaster assistance
programs as proscribed in the State Emergency Management Plan.
D. Organization - Under the general direction of the Manager, all
departments with their manpower and equipment would be involved in recovery
operations along with volunteer manpower and equipment from local sources.

SECTION XIX FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Recovery (Cont’d)
E. Responsibilities
1. The Town Manager will:
a. Assume overall direction and control of recovery
operations
b. Request State and/or Federal assistance needed after an
assessment of the community’s remaining capabilities.
c. Request volunteer manpower and equipment from local
sources
2. The Emergency Management Director will
d. Compile the documentation necessary to apply for federal
assistance
e. Act as liaison with State Emergency Management for state
assistance.
f. Coordinate recovery operations of all departments
g. Coordinate the restoration of utility services
h. Determine when radiation levels have decreased enough to
begin recovery operations following a radiological accident or
incident
3. The Building Inspector will:
a. Assist in compiling damage estimates of affected public
and private buildings
b. Determine the structural safety of damaged buildings
4. The Town Clerk will:
a. Provide for restoration of records
b. Assist in compiling damage estimates
5. The Finance Director will:
a. Compile and submit the disaster operations cost figures for
possible reimbursement
6. The School Superintendent will:
a. Provide for the restoration of school facilities
b. Continue shelter operations responsibilities
F. Concept of Operations
1. Once the emergency situation has ceased or abated
sufficiently and the damaged area has been deemed safe to enter, recovery
operations must begin based on priorities determined by the Manager
under the direction of the Town Council. Rescue and treatment of the
injured, clearing of essential streets and roads and restoring
communications capabilities and public utilities are the highest priority
operations. The Manager must assess the community's capability to
perform these functions and request local and/or state assistance where
TOWN OF LONDONDERRY Adopted 4/15/02
Title IV - Public Health, Safety, Welfare Revised 4/26/02
52
deficiencies exist. Human needs, such as food, clothing and housing, have
to be determined so that assistance can be obtained in these areas.
CHAPTER X - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN (Cont’d
SECTION XIX FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Recovery (Cont’d)
F. Concept of Operations (Cont’d)
2. Private companies, such as real estate appraisers, can and
probably would provide technical assistance in recovery operations and
damage assessment. The Independent Insurance Agents of NH maintain a
disaster response plan to assist affected communities in damage
assessment and affected citizens in claims settlements and can be
contacted through State Emergency Management.
3. As soon as the preliminary damage assessment and human
needs assessment reports are completed, this information must be
transmitted to the State Emergency Management Agency for compilation
with reports from other communities. The Governor's recommendation to
the President or to selected Federal Agencies for assistance is based on the
information received in these reports. FEMA, in turn, makes its
recommendations to the President who will then make the decision on the
type of disaster declaration to be issued.
4. The type, or types, of federal assistance that would be
available are dependent upon the type of declaration received. The
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and the State Disaster
Office will provide the lead in dispensing available federal assistance.
The community's responsibilities and procedures in disaster assistance
operations are defined in the State Emergency Management Plan.

SECTION XX FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES -Mitigation
A. Purpose - The Purpose of this Annex is to recognize that there are
potential dangers to the lives and property of the citizens of Londonderry and that
there are programs available to prevent or lessen the effects of these dangers.
B. Authorities - The authorities for this Annex are those as stated in Section
II, Authorities and applicable local zoning ordinances.
C. Situation
1. The Comprehensive Hazard Analysis shows that the community could be
subjected to the damaging effects of several hazards. Various programs are available to
prevent or lessen these effects through mitigation. In order that these mitigation
programs be effective, certain regulations and/or ordinances must be enacted by the
community and must be accomplished during a precrisis period.
2. The citizens would be receptive to initiating mitigation programs when the
potential benefits are properly explained. Private companies, which might
present potential hazards to the community, would cooperate with officials
to plan for mitigating these hazards. The State Emergency Management
Agency would be available to explain these programs and to assist in the
plans preparation.
3. The community currently is participating in the regular phase of the
National Flood Insurance Program and has enacted regulations against
building in flood plains without flood-proofing etc.

4. The Building Inspector will
a. Define building codes that will compliment the mitigation
programs
5. The Town Attorney will
a. Provide legal assistance in the preparation of the regulations and/or
ordinances necessary to accomplish the mitigation function
F. Concept of Operations
1. The Manager, the Town Council, and the community should consider for
enactment mitigation programs such as:
a. A Comprehensive Emergency Management Plan
b. A Flood Plain Management Plan
c. Site-specific Emergency Plans for hazardous materials, highhazard
dams, etc.
d. A Tie-down ordinance for mobile homes
e. Industrial zoning regulations
2. By recognizing that it is generally less expensive to mitigate the damaging effects
of a disaster than it is to recover from them, the citizens can provide themselves with a
greater measure of safety and security. Also, the community should realize that many
Federal Disaster Assistance Programs now require that state and/or local funding in the
amount of 25% be used to match the federal funding of 75%. In this manner, the Federal
Government is encouraging communities to enact mitigation programs to cut down the
cost of disaster recovery.

CHAPTER X - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN (Cont’d
SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan
A. INTRODUCTION - General
The ability of Federal State and Local Government agencies to respond to, and respond
decisively to, terrorist attacks against our citizens when they happen domestically, was
codified in Presidential Decision Directive 39 (PDD-39). This directive built upon
previous directives for combating terrorism and further defined the strategic and planning
functions that provided for interagency coordination. The responsibility for the
management of this domestic threat was given to the FBI as the Lead Federal Agency
(LFA) for the operational response to a Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) incident.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA) is responsible for preparing for
or responding to the consequences of a WMD incident, with participation by the U.S.
Public Health Service (health/medical), the EPA (HazMat and environmental), and the
DOE (radiological), as necessary.
These federal decisions recognize that WMD incidents are multi-disciplinary, multijurisdictional
events that require a broad interagency planning and response approach as
well as a cooperative partnership between federal, state, and local governments.
The South Eastern New Hampshire Hazardous Materials Mutual Aid District
(SENHHMMAD) recognizes the potential for these types of events. The purpose of this
plan is to define the supporting role that the SENHHMMAD communities provide in
WMD situations. This plan defines the scope of responsibility that the SENHHMMAD
HazMat team has in responding to WMD events where the local community and the local
plan have been overwhelmed due to the size or consequence of the event.
B. Differences Between WMD and Other Incidents
1. WMD incidents may involve mass casualties and damage to buildings or
other types of property. However, there are several factors surrounding
WMD incidents that are unlike any other type of incident that must be
considered when planning a response. Emergency responders’ ability to
identify aspects of the incident (e.g., signs and symptoms exhibited by
victims), report them accurately, and protect themselves, will be essential
to maximize the use of critical local resources that may occur at the local
level. Some of the recognition factors that first responders should use to
detect the possible occurrence of WMD incidents would be the following:
a. The situation may not be recognized as a WMD event until there
are multiple casualties. Some chemical and biological agents may
not be detectable by methods used for detection of explosives,
radiological material, and firearms. Most chemical/biological
agents can be carried in containers that look like ordinary items.

Title IV - Public Health, Safety, Welfare Revised 4/26/02
61
SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan
B. Differences Between WMD and Other Incidents (Cont’d)
1. There may be multiple events. (E.g. one event in an attempt to influence
another events’ outcome).
2. Responders are placed at a higher risk of becoming casualties, because
biological and chemical agents are not always readily identifiable.
3. Responders may become contaminated before recognizing the agent
involved. Emergency responders may, in addition, be targets for
secondary releases or explosions.
4. Contamination of critical facilities and large geographic areas may result.
Victims may carry an agent unknowingly to public transportation
facilities, businesses, residences, doctors’ offices, walk-in medical clinics,
or emergency rooms. They do this because they do not realize that they are
contaminated.
5. The scope of the incident may expand geometrically and may affect the
mutual aid system. Airborne agents flow with the air current, and if
disseminated via ventilation systems, may carry the agents far from the
initial source.
6. There will be a stronger public reaction in WMD incidents than with any
other types of incidents. The thought of exposure to a chemical or
biological agent or radiation evokes terror in most people. The fear of the
unknown also heightens the public response.
7. Time is working against the responding elements. The incident can
expand geometrically and very quickly. In addition, the effects of some
chemicals and biological agents worsen over time. There is a potential for
the re-suspension of the agent to an airborne state of contamination. Thus,
time is of the essence in on-scene activity. This should be tempered with
the realization that the incident is a crime scene.
8. Local support facilities such as fire stations, police stations, public
drinking water disinfecting facilities, and utility stations, and
communication facilities may be at risk as targets.
C. Crisis and Consequence Management
1. Crisis management addresses the causes of a terrorism incident. The
identity, motivation, and capability of the terrorists and the weapons they
employ. Crisis management is a law enforcement function.
SENHHMMAD recognizes that the law enforcement role is to measure, to
identify, acquire, and plan the use of resources needed to anticipate,
prevent and or to resolve a threat of act of terrorism.
CHAPTER X - EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT PLAN (Cont’d
TOWN OF LONDONDERRY Adopted 4/15/02
Title IV - Public Health, Safety, Welfare Revised 4/26/02
62
SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan
C. Crisis and Consequence Management (Cont’d)
1. In a terrorist incident, a crisis management response may include
traditional law enforcement missions; such as intelligence, surveillance,
tactical operations, behavioral assessment, negations, forensics, and
investigations. Other functions such as technical support missions, agent
identification, search, render safe procedures, transfer and disposal and
limited decontamination.
2. The FBI is designated as the lead agency for crisis management. In this
role, the FBI traditionally employs a “top-down” command approach. This
system manages a crisis from an FBI command post which brings in the
necessary assets to respond and resolve the threat or incident. These
activities primarily coordinate the law enforcement actions responding to
the cause of the incident with state and local agencies providing support.
3. During a crisis situation, the FBI Special Agent in Charge (SAC) of the
local Field Division will establish a command post to manage the threat
based upon a graduated and flexible response.
a. This command post structure generally consists of three functional
groups: Command, Operations, and Support. It is designed to
accommodate participation from other agencies as appropriate.
b. When the threat or incident exceeds the capabilities of the local
FBI Field Division, the SAC can request additional resources from
the regional FBI Divisions, FBIHQ, and the Critical Incident
Response Group (CIRG) located in Quantico Virginia, to augment
existing crisis management capabilities.
4. In a terrorist threat of incident, the traditional FBI command post is
expanded into a Joint Operations Center (JOC) incorporating a fourth
functional entity, the Consequence Management Group. The
Consequence Management Group consists of representatives from federal,
state, and local consequence management organizations. These groups
address the pre-release and post-release consequence operations. This
expansion of the command post into a JOC allows the FBI to manage
crisis and consequence operations concurrently.
5. Consequence management addresses how the incident affects or
potentially might affect public health, safety, and the environment.
Consequence management includes measures to protect public health,
safety, and the environment, to restore essential government services, and
to provide emergency relief to governments, businesses, and individuals
affected by the consequences of terrorism.

SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan
C. Crisis and Consequence Management (Cont’d)
6. Consequence management (Cont’d)
In an actual or potential terrorist incident, a consequence
management response will be managed by FEMA using structures and
resources provided by the Federal Response Plan. These efforts will
include support missions as described in other federal operations plans,
such as predictive modeling, protective action recommendations, and mass
decontamination.
7. State and local governments will most likely be the first to respond to the
consequences of terrorism; the federal government will provide assistance,
as required. State and local agencies may have authorities that overlap
federal jurisdictions.
8. Unlike crisis management, the Federal government does not have primary
responsibility for consequence management but supports state and local
governments. FEMA, using the Federal Response Plan, directs and
coordinates all federal response efforts to manage the consequences in
domestic incidents, for which the President has declared, or expressed
intent to declare and emergency. FEMA employs a “bottom-up” approach
in coordinating the federal response thorough the FRP, marshalling federal
resources through the state emergency management center (EOC) in
support of the local government.
9. The FBI has developed a four-tiered system of describing a developing
situation and the thresholds at which particular Federal WMD assets
should, in general, be called upon to respond to incidents or threat
condition. The Threat levels are:
a. Threat Level 4 – Minimal Threat: Received threats do not
warrant actions beyond normal liaison notifications or placing
assets or resources on a heightened alert. (Agencies are operating
under normal day-to-day conditions).
b. Threat Level 3 – Potential Threat: Intelligence or an articulated
threat indicate a potential for a terrorist incident. However, this
threat has not been assessed as credible.
1. This should initiate the credibility assessment process.
2. Notify FBI immediately.
3. As part of the on-going contingency planning process
during the developing crisis, deployment plans for followup
resources should be made, should they be required.

C. Crisis and Consequence Management (Cont’d)
1. The FBI has developed a four tiered system.....(cont’d)
c. Threat Level 2 – Credible Threat: A threat assessment indicates
that the potential threat is credible, and confirms the involvement
of WMD in the developing terrorist incident. Intelligence will
vary with each threat, and will impact the level of the Federal
response. Led by the FBI the federal focus will be on law
enforcement actions taken in the interests of public safety and
welfare, and is predominantly concerned with preventing and
resolving the threat. FEMA will support the Federal Response
with consequence management planning and pre-positioning of
tailored resources as required. The threat increases in significance
when the presence of an explosive device of WMD capable of
causing a significant destructive event, before actual injury or loss,
is confirmed. Alternatively, when intelligence and circumstances
indicates a high probability that the device exists. In this case, the
threat has developed into a WMD terrorist situation. This requires
an immediate process to identify, acquire, and plan the use of
Federal augmentation to State and local authorities in response to
the potential consequence of a terrorist use or employment of
WMD.
1. Deployment of the Domestic Emergency Support Team
(DEST) to provide assistance should be considered or
requested. As the situation develops and warrants, followup
resources should be requested.
2. A Joint Operations Center (JOC) should be established to
manage the developing crisis in the interagency
environment incorporating law enforcement planning
concerns with consequence management concerns.
d. Threat Level 1 - WMD Incident: A WMD terrorism incident has
occurred which requires an immediate process to identify, acquire,
and plan the use of Federal augmentation to State and local
authorities in response to limited or major consequences of a
terrorist use or employment of WMD. This incident has resulted in
mass casualties. The federal response is primarily directed toward
public safety and welfare and the preservation of human life.
1. FEMA would lead the federal government’s efforts to
respond to the devastation through consequence
management in support of the FBI.

d. Threat Level 1 - WMD Incident: (Cont’d)
1. A JOC should be formed to integrate consequence
management concerns with the law enforcement effort.
The perpetrators may have additional devices. The
investigation should continue under the JOC command
concept until the threat of additional devices is mitigated;
or other contingencies regarding the incident are resolved.
The incident site may expand to multiple sites, which can
be strategically coordinated by the JOC
2. Authorized personnel only should approach all chemical,
biological, or nuclear material, which includes the
Hazardous Materials Response Unit.
3. Untrained personnel should inspect known or suspected
chemical, biological, or nuclear materials. Field-testing
and transportation for lab testing is to be coordinated with
the Hazardous Materials Response Unit.
D. Incident Response - Role of SENHHMMAD in Crisis and Consequence
Management
Any violent act or an act dangerous to human life that may include
weapons of mass destruction that serves to intimidate or coerce the citizens and
political subdivisions living under the SENHHMMAD jurisdiction is of great
concern to our member communities.
1. Pre-Emergency - Crisis Management, as it relates to SENHHMMAD, will
be a proactive process that is evolutionary in nature. It is our commitment
to train all SENHHMMAD personnel in the basic response concepts in
terrorism and WMD incidents. In addition to that, the SENHHMMAD
HazMat Team has been trained in the 16 hour National Fire Academy
course in Emergency Response to Terrorism. Also, members of the
HazMat team are encouraged to attend the COBRA, WMD Hazardous
Materials Technician Training Course at The Center for Domestic
Preparedness.

SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan
D. Incident Response - Role of SENHHMMAD in Crisis and Consequence
Management(Cont’d)
1. It is the responsibility of each local community to identify and pre-plan
those facilities and locations that may have some sensitivity as potential
targets for terrorist activities. Some examples of these types of facilities
might include:
a. Fire Stations Police Stations
Communications Centers Planned Parenthood Clinics
Government Facilities Medical Facilities
Utility Facilities Power plants
Churches Water Purification Facilities
Communication Infrastructures Public Transportation Modes
b. This pre planning process should be incorporated into the local
plans in order for SENHHMMAD personnel to access and
implement the preplan actions. Crisis Management refers in a
general sense to pre emergency activities.
3. SENHHMMAD is striving to meet its responsibilities in terrorism
response by preparing its personnel for such contingencies. The
preplanning function is incumbent upon the local community. With the
support and cooperation of the SENHHMMAD in helping prepare for
terrorist incidents, member communities can plan, prepare, train, exercise
strategies and tactics that can minimize the potential for harm to the
general population and the District responders when responding to
terrorism incidents with the potential for WMD. Some local
considerations that can be assessed in the local community are:
a. Resources need to protect populations
b. Level of public awareness education and training
c. Evacuation routes
d. Availability of sufficient resources
e. Site security and Agency Responsibilities
4. The emergency response challenge for the local communities within
SENHHMMAD is indeed profound. The recognized protocols observed
by the local communities as well as the SENHHMMAD response team
shall be implemented at all incidents involving or suspected to involve
WMD. It is recognized that if the incident is a potential act of terrorism, it
is also a crime scene. It is understood that crime scene considerations will
be a complicating factor in emergency response operations.

SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan
E. Emergency Response Operation - Initial Response
1. It is imperative that all SENHMMAD consequence personnel shall remain
focused on reducing the impact of the event as safely and efficiently as
possible. All responders shall follow established SENHHMMAD
Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) at all times. Public safety will
largely depend on the ability of our responders to effectively conduct
hazard and risk analysis of the affected population. It is recognized by
federal agencies that strategies used by the SENHHMMAD HazMat Team
during hazardous materials incidents should be applied to a terrorist event.
2. The safety of the public will in large measure depend on the ability of the
responders to effectively conduct a hazard and risk analysis of the affected
area and population. The most effective way to realize these goals is
implement rapid decisions based on sound size-up techniques, which
consider the implementation of public protection measures when
escalating dangers, exist. These practices and procedures shall take into
consideration the health and safety of the responders at all times.
3. It is a challenging task at any significant incident to continually gather
information and factor in the information and translate that into the best
decision. All recognized risk management principles shall be applied in
order to reduce the risk to tolerable levels in any given circumstance.
4. Protection of SENHHMMAD personnel is based on avoiding or
minimizing exposure through the principals of time, distance and
shielding. Proven tactical methods used in conventional Hazmat situations
that include; isolation, evacuation, denial of entry, and hazard
identification should be implemented. A self-protection measure for
SENHHMMAD personnel is to understand the various types of harm that
members may be exposed to. The acronym TRACEM can be utilized to
understand the concepts.
Thermal
Radiological
Asphyxiation
Chemical
Etiological
Mechanical
5. During a large scale WMD event, SENHHMMAD personnel shall
consider the following options for the protecting of the public.
a. Evacuation of all threatened populations
a. Protection in place for all
b. Combination of evacuation and protection in place by evacuating
some populations and protecting others in place.

E. Emergency Response Operation - Initial Response (Cont’d)
6. Tactical considerations when SENHHMMAD personnel approach
any type of suspicious incident should include:
a. Always approach the scene utilizing protective clothing and
equipment including SCBA. Self-protection is the first priority.
b. Be alert for warning signs that may indicate the type of danger
present. Keep in mind that chemical, biological, or radiological
hazards may be present.
c. Obvious signs of criminal activity such as weapons on the scene
may indicate a perpetrator among the victims or lurking nearby.
d. When practical, position first in vehicles and responders uphill and
upwind
e. Avoid positioning vehicles in such a manner as to not impede or
interfere with evacuation routes for the responders and the public.
f. Avoid line of sight staging when there are suspected explosive
devices. Staging orders should be strictly enforced.
g. Assign a safety observer to observe on going activities surrounding
the operational area. This person should be alert for criminal
activities and secondary events. Potential secondary events:
1. Potential snipers
2. Containers holding potential secondary devices (bags,
boxes, briefcases)
3. Vehicles out of place
4. Hazardous materials containers
5. Other anomalies
h. Plans tentative escape routes and refuge assembly points.
i. Prepare for emergency decontamination on arrival and during all
phases of the incident.
7. Although the incident may overwhelm the first arriving district units,
efforts to gain control must start immediately, regardless of the resources
on hand. The concept of work zones should be implemented when task
oriented activities are taking place. The emphasis is on firefighter health
and safety and this should be of the utmost concern to local incident
commanders. The SENHHMMAD, team in these types of operations will
respond identically to the rules and standard operating procedures that
have been adopted for convention HazMat response.

TOWN OF LONDONDERRY Adopted 4/15/02

Terrorism Contingency Plan (Cont’d)
F. Concept of Operations - Biological Agents:
1. The most practical method of initiating infection using biological agents
is through aerosolization, (mists, sprays, and fumes) which are in essence
fine particles that are sprayed over or upwind of a target. Because of the
size of the particles, they have the potential to be inhaled. An aerosol may
be effective for some time after the delivery. The aerosol will be
deposited on such items as clothing, equipment, and soil. When the
clothing is used at a later time interval, or if dust is stirred up, the public as
well as first responders may be subject to “secondary” contamination.
2. Biological agents may be able to be delivered through other routes of entry
into the body other than the respiratory tract. Individuals may be infected
or contaminated through ingestion of the agent through such natural body
functions as eating and drinking. Or direct contact with the skin or
mucous membranes through natural openings in the protective clothing of
the responders. Full respiratory protection SCBA with level chemical
protective clothing is essential.
3. Biological agents are unique in the fact that symptoms of exposure may
occur minutes, hours, days, or weeks after an incident has occurred. The
time required before symptoms are observed is dependent on the agent
used. There are currently no monitoring devices available for first
responders to use for determining if biological agents are involved in an
incident. Work continues on developing test methods, but often the first
clue will come from blood tests or by other means used by medical
personnel. Another method is by observing possible symptoms of people
exposed in the area.
G. Concept of Operations - Chemical Agents:
1. As in conventional Hazmat responses there are many clues that may be
present to indicate that a WMD event has occurred. Some of the clues are:
a. Unusual numbers of dying animals are present
b. Lack of insect life. If normal insect activity is absent, check the
ground or water surfaces or interfaces for dead insects.
c. Numerous individuals are experiencing unexplained water-like
blisters, wheals (bee sting like), and or rashes.
d. Numerous individuals are exhibiting serious health problems
ranging from nausea to disorientation to having difficulty breathing
to convulsions to death. These types of occurrences should make it
apparent that there is a mass casualty event in progress.

Terrorism Contingency Plan (Cont’d)
G. Concept of Operations - Chemical Agents: (Cont’d)
1. As in conventional Hazmat responses there are many clues... (Cont’d)
e. There is the presence of unusual liquid droplets. Numerous
surfaces exhibit oily droplets or film; numerous water surfaces
have an oily film. These conditions should be abnormal to the
current weather conditions. i.e. no recent rain and not the
accumulation of pollen or algae.
f. Unusual and or unscheduled spraying of the environment.
g. Abandoned spray devices, such as chemical sprayers used by
landscaping crews.
h. Unexplained odors are present. It is important to note that the
particular odor is completely out of character with the
surroundings (for instance the smell of garlic which would be
indicative of a mustard agent)
i. The possible mixing of critical agents presents an additional
concern to first responders because this process will make it
extremely difficult to identify the type and the toxic constituents of
the chemical agent. Remember in such cases the only way to begin
identification of the chemical agent is to observe the symptoms
present in the victims.
First responders should take caution because without advance
warning first responders may become victims in such an incident. The
health and safety of first responders is of paramount concern. If first
responders become part of the problem the entire delivery of services breaks
down.
H. Concept of Operations - Nuclear and Radiological:
1. The problem with radiation is that it is an invisible hazard. Unless the
responding local community has adequate radiation detection equipment,
or if the source material is clearly marked and identified, there is a strong
chance that the initial identification will go unnoticed by responders.
Additionally, there is no single instrumentation device that is capable of
detecting all forms of radiation. The technology is still only capable
detecting each separate types of radiation.
2. The primary consideration of first responders is respiratory protection
SCBA and personal protective equipment in sufficient quantity to protect
SENHHMMAD personnel when presence of alpha or beta particles are
detected or suspected.

Terrorism Contingency Plan (Cont’d)
H. Concept of Operations - Nuclear and Radiological: (Cont’d)
3. The following are some general concerns that should be considered when
responding to an incident involving nuclear or radiological materials.
a. If it is known or believed that radioactive material has been
released, it should be assumed that personnel and property might
be contaminated. This means clothing, equipment, vehicles,
buildings, and the ground.
b. Experts such a health physicians, radiological and safety offices or
Department of Energy experts will be needed to identify the exact
nature of the nuclear or radiological material.
c. If the source of contamination is known, a Hot Line (outside
perimeter of a Hot Zone) needs to be established to prevent further
contamination of the area and personnel. If the source is unknown,
the limits of the contamination must be found so a hot line and
clean area can be established.
d. Prior to establishing a Hot line, a determination will have to be
made as whether the radioactive material is or is not scattered
around the area and has or has not contaminated shoes, clothing,
uncovered head and arms or legs, vehicles, equipment, and other
material in the area.
e. A radiological monitoring expert or a health physician must make
estimates of an individual’s radiation exposure doses. This is a
matter for experienced radiation monitoring experts. However, all
first responding SENHHMMAD personnel should ideally be
equipped with individual dosimeters so such experts can measure
the amount of exposure. In event that an incident occurs involving
radiation material, the health and safety of response personnel is
critical. Personnel should be advised of the hazards and operations
should be defensive in nature. Risk and exposure of
SENHHMMAD personnel after a risk assessment process has
occurred, shall be to a minimized due to the fact that protection
strategies are limited.
f. SENHHMMAD response personnel must be evaluated for
contamination by conducting the following protocols:
1. Perform a survey of clothing, ambulances, police cruisers,
equipment, etc. before undertaking further action or
activity.
2. If contamination is detected, items such clothing should be
discarded in a container marked “radioactive - Do not
discard” Personal hygiene including appropriate selfwashing
and or showing should occur.

H. Concept of Operations - Nuclear and Radiological: (Cont’d)
3. The following are some general concerns....(Cont’d)
f. SENHHMMAD response personnel must be evaluated for
contamination by conducting the following protocols: (Cont’d)
1. If in contaminated areas, District first responders must be
surveyed by a radiation survey meter. The measurements
must be recorded. Any levels of concern are indicative of
emergency medical monitoring for those individuals
affected. Cleaning and decontamination will continue until
a responsible and competent individual indicates the all
clear.
g. Equipment shall be surveyed and if indications from a competent
persons will dictate the method to accomplish these procedures.
4. The rescue of victims is dependent on what type of radioactive material is
involved in the incident. The important thing is to remove the victims
from the source area. Remember, the longer individuals and response
personnel remain in the hot zone, the higher the dose of radiation that will
be absorbed.
I. Concept of Operations - Alpha particles – As long as first responders have
SCBA and firefighting gear is donned, the level of protection provided by fire
gear is sufficient for the rapid removal of victims. This is the same procedure
currently in existence within the SENHHMMAD for any HazMat situation.
J. Concept of Operations - Beta particles – SCBA and fully encapsulating level A
will not be enough to work in the source area. Quick in and out carry and drag of
victims away from the source may be the only way to rescue victims. This should
only be conducted when the risk assessment process identifies this is the only
viable method of removing victims.
K. Concept of Operations - Gamma, X-ray, and Neutrons – Typical effective
shielding materials, such as lead for gamma radiation and hydrogen containing
materials for neutron radiation, are not practical shielding materials for neutron
radiation, and are not practical shielding materials for first responders. (they are
too heavy). The only effective way is to decrease the exposure to first responders
is to limit the amount of time in the hazardous environment. This option should
be only considered as last resort. Careful consideration should be given before
committing personnel to this type of operation. If the presence of nuclear or
radiological material is suspected, personnel should not enter the area under any
circumstance without respiratory protective equipment. An appropriate action
would be to cordon off the suspect area and prevent entry of any personnel until
the proper monitoring can be initiated

L. Coordination of Resources for Actual or Suspected WMD Events.
1. In the event that a WMD event is occurring or has occurred the State of
New Hampshire WMD Emergency Notification Resource List should be
consulted for the appropriate notification. A copy of this updated list
follows on page of this document.
2. When it has been determined that the situation requires a response beyond
the capabilities of the local fire department, Derry Fire Dispatch shall be
notified that a WMD event is in progress. Bear in mind that the
appropriate level of response from the District is a Level Four activation
because of the potential for or actual release of a WMD. Such indicators of
a WMD are located in the form located on page of this document.
3. Life safety for responders is critical to the success of any response to
WMD events. SENHHMMAD has determined that these types of
incidents will be handled identical to conventional Hazmat responses.
Therefore all federal, state, and local health and safety regulations will be
followed; and team operations will be conducted in parallel and in concert
with local operations. Initiating, focusing, and enforcing the life safety
aspect as a priority of operations, will accomplish this mission. These
aspects will be considered primary to collateral and or civilian casualties
already incurred
4. Use the criteria from the Initial Discovery Procedure located in page of
this document to provide for the actions of all local responders prior to
the arrival of the SENHHMMAD team.
5. The SENHHMMAD has identified the Jane’s CHEM-BIO Handbook as
the resource tool for all responders within the District. For the purposes of
this plan, it shall be adopted as the field manual for use in any and all
WMD potential or actual events. This tool can be integrated with other
recognized resources such as but not limited to the North American
Emergency Response Guidebook (DOT Guidebook) and the NIOSH
pocketguide for chemicals, and the SENHHMMAD SCARIEPM Form.
All of which are resources currently recognized as valuable in HazMat
operations.
6. The Agent Indicator Matrix located on page 14 of the Chem-Bio
Handbook is a critical tool in helping first responders to help determine
the agent type, by gathering information on the scene. Bear in mind that
this tool is designed to give the best approximation of the agent used but is
not considered definitive until confirmed by HazMat or Medical
personnel. However this tool can help responders learn of the effects and
the treatment algorithms for particular chemicals or agents.

Terrorism Contingency Plan (Cont’d)
L. Coordination of Resources for Actual or Suspected WMD Events (Cont’d)
7. Control of the scene because it is a potential crime scene is important.
Establishment of the appropriate zones is identical to the conventional
HazMat situation. In addition there is an inner and outer perimeter for
crime scene management and protocol procedures.
Control Measures
1. To prevent further contamination to personnel crowd control is imperative.
Victims (people inside the Hot zone when you arrived) should be contained
and unauthorized individuals should not be allowed to enter the hot zone.
2. Maintain inner and outer perimeters in conjunction with law enforcement.
3. Maintain clear routes of entry and exit for emergency vehicles and
personnel.
4. Direct victims showing no signs of exposure to a holding area (inside the
hot zone but well away from the decon station) for evaluation by the
HazMat team.
5 All individuals showing signs of contamination should be directed to the hot
zone for immediate decon procedures
6. Most victims will leave the scene to get medical attention at a facility prior
to the arrival of response personnel. This necessitates that similar crowd
control and decon be set up at those facilities.
8. It is conceivable that emergency responders could become exposed to an agent
during an incident. It is vital that personnel do not panic if they suspect that there
has been an actual or potential exposure. Although the levels of PPE issued to
firefighters does not offer chemical protection, many cases the awareness of a
WMD event may not happen for a time during the response. Survival and
prevention of further exposure depends on the steps taken to remove the agent or
chemical. The guides appearing on page of this document provide first
responders with the methods to decon for the following situations:
1. Gross Decon Procedures
2. Field Expedient Ambulatory and Self/Buddy Decon
3. Litter patient Decon
Remember these procedures should not supercede notification of the
SENHHMMAD team, but serve as a stop gap measure until the team can be
deployed. The rule of thumb for response of the team to make initial site entry is one
hour from initial notification to Derry dispatch. So time is of the essence.

9. Solutions and supplies available in local stores for use in Emergency
Decon:
a. Clorox bleach: 5.25% hypochlorite solution
b. Aqua Chem Shock Treatment 67% calcium hypochlorite
c. Aqua Chem Granular Chlorinator 65% calcium hypochlorite
d. 50-gallon plastic garbage cans
e. Hand pump pressurized garden sprayer
f. Sponges, brushes, gloves
g. 5 mil plastic tarps.
10. The SENHHMMAD team has the capability and the training to respond to
potential or actual WMD events. The level A suits have compatibility
with most WMD agents that are likely to be encountered in responses.
The technical expertise and response capabilities of this team make it an
integral resource that needs to be activated to mitigate the potential
consequences to the responders and the public in these types of events. In
cases where team deployment is required the capabilities provided to the
local agencies may include:
Mass Decon Air monitoring
Site Recon Mass casualty evacuation and triage
Site Entry Evidence collection
Product ID Technical support
11. The SENHHMMAD recognizes that there is a potential for its members to
be exposed to such types of incidents as bomb threats or situation where
explosives are indicated. These situations shall be considered essentially a
law enforcement event, and the local fire departments and the
SENHHMMAD shall coordinate with law enforcement incident
commander throughout the event. Such situations are state and or federal
EOD type of responses. The SENHHMMAD may find itself present in
these types of incidents. We recognize that we are there only to support
and advise the lead agencies identified above. These violent acts mandate
that that the fire department incident commander shall stage all fire
department resources in a safe area until law enforcement agencies have
secured the scene.
12. SENHHMMAD members that provide support to law enforcement
agencies Special Weapons and Tactics (SWAT) operations shall receive
special training. Special standard operating procedures shall be developed
that describe the training and safety of these SENHHMMAD members for
such operation. These activities shall be considered as special operations
for the purposes of this WMD Plan.

N. INITIAL DISCOVERY PROCEDURES
1. Remain calm
2. While approaching the scene, don all personal protective equipment,
including SCBA. Remember, firefighting gear provides no chemical
protection
3. If you are already on the scene, and suspect it is a WMD event,
immediately retreat to a safe location and call for the SENHHMMAD
team through Derry Fire Alarm, 432-6121
4. Maintain a safe position in a safe location
a. Stay upwind and uphill
b. For facility responses, HVAC systems could further disperse
agents
c. If there is a visible cloud, stay well clear of it. (Remember, most
agents of mass destruction do not produce a visible cloud, because
that it what makes them most effective as weapons in a military
setting.)
d. Keep personnel and civilians a safe distance from the scene.
5. If PPE is not available, keep a minimum distance of 300 feet or double the
safe distance with PPE; whichever is greater. Even is proper Level A
protection is available, stay 75 feet from the event until the agent and its
concentration are identified.
6. Initiate the Incident Command System (ICS).
7. If chemical agent can be determined, refer to Page 53 of JANES CHEMBIO.
It is important to note that some chemical agents do not begin to
cause symptoms for hours or even days after exposure.
8. If agent is determined to be biological, use extreme caution. All
contact must be avoided. Do not attempt to identify the agent further.
It is beyond your capability. Qualified medical personnel can only
identify it. Remember that biological agents do not begin to cause
symptoms until hours or days later.
9. Observe notification protocols and make reports to the appropriate
agencies, noting any or all of the following:
a. What you have observed
b. Wind direction and weather conditions on scene
c. Plume direction (direction of cloud or vapor travel)
d. Orientation of victims (direction, position, pattern)
e. Number of apparent victims
f. Type of injuries, symptoms presented (as observed from a safe
distance)
g. Witness statements or observations

SECTION XXIII FUNCTIONAL ANNEXES - Weapons of Mass Destruction/Domestic
Terrorism Contingency Plan (Cont’d)
N. INITIAL DISCOVERY PROCEDURES (Cont’d)
11. Attempt to talk with victims
a. Inform them that help is on the way
b. Reassure victims that if they follow instructions, you will be able
to help them. Try to keep them calm.
c. Explain that response personnel will begin decontamination and
tell victims what the procedures are
d. Have all ambulatory victims move to a location that is within the
exclusion zone, but away from the actual release site to reduce
changes of further contamination.
O. GROSS DECONTAMINATION PROCEDURES
1. If vapor contamination has been determined, victims should be placed
outside in a breeze if possible. Victims exposed to vapor only may not
require decontamination, other than the removal of outer clothing.
Consult local protocol and SENHHMMAD procedures.
2. If liquid contamination is present on victims:
a. In some jurisdictions, the rescuer initiates decon by hosing the
victims before removing the victim’s clothing. Other jurisdictions
have chosen not to do this because the force of the spray from the
hose may drive the chemical through the clothing and onto the
skin, since water soluble agents will go through the clothing with
water onto skin and because wet clothing is less protective than dry
clothing. This is a local option.
b. Have victims remove their outer clothing
c. Flush victims with water and/or hypochlorite and water, according
to local procedures and protocols.
d. Victims should don covering apparel, such as paper gowns, after
decontamination.

DECONTAMINATION
1. Remove any signs of gross contamination by scraping, sweeping or
blotting the material away
2. Remove clothing or equipment rapidly, but cautiously. Clothing should be
pulled away from the body. In the event clothing needs to be removed
over the head, cut it away.
3. After completing Steps 1 and 2, wash hands prior to continuing the
process

DECONTAMINATION (Cont’d)
4. Remove all external items from contact with the body. Such items include
jewelry, watches, artificial limbs, wigs, etc. If the victim or rescuer cannot
safety evacuate the area without the use of eyeglasses, the glasses should
be immersed in a solution of bleach for a period of at least five (5)
minutes.
5. After removing eyeglasses or contact lenses, flush the eye with water
before skin decontamination.
6. Gently wash face and hair with soap and lukewarm water, followed by a
thorough rinse with lukewarm water.
7. Begin to decontaminate other body surfaces, starting from the neck down
and using a supplied solution (usually bleach). Blot with a cloth (do not
swab or wipe). Wash the same areas in lukewarm soapy water, rinsing in
clear lukewarm water. In the absence of bleach solution, flushing with
copious amounts of lukewarm soapy water and rinsing with lukewarm
water is useful.
8. Change into uncontaminated clothing or blankets.
Q. LITTER PATIENT DECONTAMINATION
1. Remove any signs of gross contamination from victims prior to entering
the decontamination station.
2. Transfer the patient to a decon preparation litter and cut away all clothing
and remove all personal property. After the patient’s clothing has been cut
away, the patient should be transferred to a decon litter or a canvas litter
with a plastic sheeting cover. All property should be bagged, secured and
clearly identified.
3. Eyeglasses and contact lenses care:
a. Rescuers’ hands must decon by blotting with solution then
thoroughly rinsed with water before removing contact lenses.
Contact lenses should be removed to decrease the risk of cross

Title IV - Public Health, Safety, Welfare Revised 4/26/02
81
contamination.
b. Cointact lenses should be collected and discarded.
c. Eyeglasses in metal frames can be deconed in a bath of bleach
solution for five (5 )minutes followed by a thorough rinsing
d. If eyeglasses are in a composite plastic frame, they should be
secured in an impermeable bag for later decon.
4. Decon Team Members should decon their gloves and aprons (if they are
wearing them) with 5% bleach solution.

Q. LITTER PATIENT DECONTAMINATION (Cont’d)
5. The victims’ skin, excluding the face, should be blotted with a 0.5%
bleach solution. Superficial wounds are flushed with a 0.5% bleach
solution, and new dressings applied as needed. Splints are not removed
but saturated to the skin with 0.5% solution. If the split cannot be
saturated, it must be removed sufficiently so that everything under the
splint can be saturated with a 0.5% bleach solution.
6. The victims should then be showered or otherwise washed with copious
amounts of water, starting with the face and hands, then the rest of the
body.
7. Following the water decontamination, personnel should carry out medical
screening procedures.
8. Following successful decon, an individual should be transferred to the
support area where they will receive clothing, and observed for further
signs of exposure.
9. Each individual, having been processed through decon, should be marked
and identified as such. This can be accomplished with a triage tag or by
writing on a victims forehead. During processing each individual should
receive paperwork indicating:
a. Decription of decon actions taken
b. Time decon was completed
c. Time released from observation area and
d. Any medical treatments performed in conjunction with decon
e. Copies of this also to accompany decon record management

SECTION I – AUTHORITY
The enabling legislation is RSA 31:102-A – “Hawkers, Peddlers and Vendors. The governing
board of a city, town or village district may adopt, by ordinance or regulations, provisions for the
licensor and regulation of itinerant vendors, hawkers, peddlers, traders, farmer, merchants, or
other persons who sell, offer to sell, or take orders for merchandise from temporary of transient
sales locations within a town or who go from town to town or place to place within a town for
such purposes. Any person who violates any provision of such ordinance or regulation shall be
guilty of a violation, and each continuing day of violation after notice shall constitute a separate
offense. A city, town or village district shall be specifically prohibited, however from licensing
or regulating a candidate for public office in the process of obtaining signatures on nomination
papers, who seeks to have his name placed on the ballot for the state general election by
submitting nomination papers under RSA 655:40. Provisions adopted under this section shall be
in addition to any requirements imposed by the state under either RSA 320 or RSA 321 and may
include, but shall not be limited to:
A. Classification of licensees consistent with constitutional requirements of equal
protection;
B. Imposition of reasonable requirements, including fees, for the issuance of a license:
C. Restrictions as to the areas of municipality open to licensees and the hours and days

Chapter II - ALCOHOL AND DRUG TESTING POLICY
SECTION I INTRODUCTION AND GENERAL REQUIREMENTS
A. The US Department of Transportation ("DOT") has issued regulations
which govern the use/misuse of drugs and alcohol by covered employees
within the transportation industry. These regulations also require Town of
Londonderry (the “Town”) to conduct drug and alcohol testing at certain
times and under the conditions described below.
B. The provisions of this policy are intended to enable the Town to comply with
the requirements established by the regulations, and should be interpreted
accordingly.
SECTION II EMPLOYEE COPY OF TOWN POLICY
A. All applicants for positions with the Town as DOT covered employees (or
who are transferred to such positions) will be provided with a copy of this
policy prior to being required to submit to its provisions.
SECTION III COVERED EMPLOYEES SUBJECT TO THIS POLICY
A. Every person who performs a safety-sensitive function or operates a
commercial motor vehicle (CMV) for the Town (whether in interstate or
intrastate commerce) and is subject to the commercial drivers license (CDL)
requirements of 49 CFR part 383 is subject to this policy. If you need a CDL,
you're covered by this policy, unless you have been granted a waiver from
the requirements of the CDL program. This includes, but is not limited to:
full time, regularly employed drivers; casual, intermittent or occasional
drivers; leased drivers and independent, owner-operator contractors who are
either directly employed by or under lease to the Town or who operate a
CMV at the direction of or with the consent of the Town. Applicants for, or
transferees to, covered positions are also subject to this policy.

these policies. In particular, the following prohibition shall apply to
them:
1. No supervisor or departmental representative shall permit a covered
employee to perform or to continue to perform any safety-sensitive
functions with the Town, knowing that such performance would
constitute a violation of these policies.
SECTION VII TESTS REQUIRED
A. GENERAL covered employees are subject to testing for alcohol and
controlled substances. At a minimum, covered employees will be tested for
the following drugs and/or their metabolites: marijuana, cocaine, opiates,
phencyclidine, and amphetamines.
B. ALCOHOL testing will utilize breath specimens analyzed by an evidential

D. CONDITIONS (Cont’d)
1. Pre-Employment/Pre Duty* (Cont’d)
c. Execute authorization for Town to obtain all of the applicant's
test results (including refusals to be tested) from each Town for
whom the applicant either worked, or took or refused to take a
DOT required or permitted drug or alcohol test within the
previous 2 years. A prior positive test result (or refusal to test)
may disqualify the applicant from further consideration for the
position.
d. Comply with any other conditions or requirements of which
the applicant is advised in connection with the offer to hire or
transfer.
e. The Town will notify applicants of test results only upon
written request provided by the applicant within 60 days of
having notification of the Town's hire or transfer decision.
Existing employees will be notified only in the event of a
positive test (i.e., drugs detected).
* (no alcohol)
2. Reasonable Suspicion
a. For the purpose of requiring drug or alcohol testing,
reasonable suspicion will be determined to exist when a
covered employee's appearance, behavior, speech, breath or
body odors indicate drug or alcohol use, or chronic or
withdrawal effects of drugs.
b. Such observations must be personally observed and
documented by at least one Town official who has received
training covering the physical, behavioral, speech, and
performance indicators of probable drug and/or alcohol use.
c. Third party observations indicative of substance abuse must be
confirmed by a supervisor with the appropriate (drug and/or
alcohol) training. The supervisor who initiates reasonable
suspicion alcohol testing may not perform the alcohol test or
specimen collection or testing.

D. CONDITIONS (Cont’d)
2. Reasonable Suspicion (Cont’d)
d. Alcohol testing is authorized under the regulations only if the
observations required by the preceding paragraph are made
during, just preceding, or just after the driver performs safetysensitive
functions.
e. If an alcohol test is not administered within two hours, the
Town shall maintain on file a record stating the reasons the
alcohol test was not promptly administered. If a required
alcohol test is not administered within eight hours following
the determination of reasonable suspicion, the Town shall
cease attempts to administer an alcohol test and shall state in
the record the reasons for not administering the tests.
f. The Town shall not take any action against a driver based
solely on the driver's behavior and appearance, with respect to
alcohol use, in the absence of an alcohol test, unless required
by some other applicable policy. However, even without a
reasonable suspicion alcohol test being taken, drivers are
prohibited from reporting for duty or remaining on duty
requiring the performance of safety-sensitive functions while
the driver is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol, as
shown by behavioral, speech and performance indicators of
alcohol misuse, and the Town shall not permit such a driver to
perform or continue to perform safety-sensitive functions until
an alcohol test is administered and the driver's alcohol
concentration measures less than 0.02 or twenty-four hours
have elapsed following the determination of reasonable
suspicion.
g. If the covered employee who requires reasonable suspicion
testing does not require immediate medical attention, the
employee will be transported by an agent of Town to the
specimen collection site and be tested as directed (alcohol
and/or drugs) as soon as possible. The Town will also attempt
to contact spouse, other family member, or other person
designated by the employee, or to make arrangements for
other suitable transportation in order to transport the
employee to his/her home following reasonable-suspicion
testing.

3. Post Accident:
a. As soon as practicable following an accident, testing shall be
required for each surviving driver:
1. Who was performing safety-sensitive functions, if the
accident involved the loss of human life; or
2. Who receives a citation for a moving traffic violation
arising from the accident. Covered employees must
contact their immediate supervisor or another Town
official as soon as possible following the accident and
remain readily available for testing.
b. Failure to do either will be considered refusal to submit to
testing unless the delay results from a need to arrange medical
attention or to establish assistance in responding to an
accident.
4. Return-To-Duty:
a. Prior to a return-to-duty in any position involving safetysensitive
functions with the Town, every covered employee who
has violated this policy (but not employees who tested positive
for alcohol with a concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than
0.04) shall be required to undergo and pass a return-to-duty
test for alcohol and/or controlled substances and must be
evaluated by a substance abuse professional (SAP) who will
determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs in
resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse or
controlled substances use.
b. Such employees must also be further evaluated to determine
their compliance with any rehabilitation program prescribed
by the SAP.
c. The employee shall be responsible for the cost of the services
of the SAP, although insurance coverage may be available.

5. Random: (Cont’d)
a. The Town is required by DOT regulations to test covered
employees at random and without prior notice.
b. Each covered employee will have an equal chance of being
selected during each selection period and may be selected more
than one time per year. Therefore covered employees are
subject to random selection and testing at any and all times
throughout the year. Selections are made on a mathematically
random basis to ensure that employees cannot be singled out
by individual.
c. Covered employees selected for random testing will be notified
and must immediately report to the specimen collection site.
d. Refusal to submit to any required drug or alcohol test shall be
equivalent to a positive test result. A covered employee who
fails or refuses to submit to random testing immediately
following notification (or, who test positive) is unqualified to
perform (or continue to perform) any safety-sensitive function
for Town, and is subject to disciplinary action up to and
including termination of employment in addition to penalties
or consequences imposed by DOT regulations.
6. Follow-Up:
a. Following a determination by a substance abuse professional
(SAP) that a covered employee is in need of assistance in
resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and/or use
of controlled substances, such employees are subject to a
minimum of 6 unannounced follow-up tests over the first 12
months.
b. The SAP can require additional testing for up to 60 months
following return-to-duty.
F. Covered employees who submit to drug or alcohol testing at the direction of
a law enforcement officer must contact their supervisor (or another Town
official) immediately and provide the Town with the name, badge number
and telephone number of the officer who conducted the testing.

SECTION VII TESTS REQUIRED (Cont’d)
G. Covered employees who are required to submit to post-accident testing may,
at the Town’s discretion, be assigned to non-safety sensitive duties, or placed
on non-disciplinary suspension, while awaiting the post-accident test results.
H. In addition to any penalties or consequences imposed by DOT regulations,
covered employees who test positive for drugs or alcohol, who refuse or fail
to submit to post-accident drug and alcohol testing as required, or who
otherwise fail to comply with the Town's post-accident testing procedures,
will be subject to disciplinary action up to and including discharge.
SECTION VIII TESTING PROCEDURES
A. GENERAL: To protect covered employees and the integrity of testing
processes and to ensure the validity of the test results, the DOT has
established stringent regulations to which the Town will adhere. Although
the Town may delegate testing responsibilities to suitably qualified entities,
the Town has adopted policies, standards, and procedures covering:
specimen collection processes and the chain-of-custody (COC); initial and
confirmation tests; review of test results by a Medical Review Officer
(MRO); and reporting and record keeping, which are covered below and in
the appendixes to this policy.
B. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY:
1. General: For both alcohol and drug testing, standard (DOT
approved) custody and control forms will be utilized. Specimen
donors will receive a copy of the custody and control form(s) at the
time specimens are provided. The collection site person is responsible
for maintaining the integrity of the specimen collection and transfer
process, ensuring the modesty and privacy of the specimen donor, and
avoiding any conduct or remarks that might be construed as
accusatorial or otherwise offensive or inappropriate. Unless it is
impracticable for any other individual to perform this function, a
direct supervisor of a covered employee shall not serve as the
collection site person (especially for reasonable-cause testing).

SECTION VIII TESTING PROCEDURES (Cont’d)
B. SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND CHAIN-OF-CUSTODY: (Cont’d)
2. Alcohol: The specimen shall be collected only by a breath alcohol
technician (BAT) trained to proficiency in the operation of a
evidential breath testing device (EBT) used for the test. Training
must meet NHTSA standards and be equivalent to the DOT model
course. Alcohol testing will be done in accordance with 49 CFR Part
40, Subpart C.
3. Drugs: The collection site person shall have successfully completed
training to carry out this function or shall be a licensed medical
professional or technician who is provided instruction for collection
and certifies completion as required under 49 CFR 40.23. The split
sample method of collection will be used for all drug testing.
C. INITIAL AND CONFIRMATION TESTING
1. Alcohol: Both initial and confirmation tests for alcohol will utilize an
evidential breath testing device (EBT) on the Conforming Products
List (CPL) approved by NHTSA. An initial alcohol test with result of
0.02 or greater will be followed by a confirmation test that provides
quantitative data of alcohol concentration.
2. Drugs: Initial testing will utilize an immunoassay screen to eliminate
"negative" urine specimens from further consideration. An initial lab
positive result will be followed by gas chromatography/mass
spectrometry (CG/MS) to ensure reliability of the lab test result prior
to review by the MRO.
D. MEDICAL REVIEW OF LAB RESULTS
1. The Town Medical Review Officer (MRO) will review all drug
test results which have been confirmed positive by the lab.

SECTION VIII TESTING PROCEDURES (Cont’d)
D. MEDICAL REVIEW OF LAB RESULTS (Cont’d)
2. Prior to reporting such results to the Town, the covered employee will
be contacted and given an opportunity to discuss the lab results with
the MRO and to present any alternate explanations for any positive
test result.
3. Medications prescribed for someone else (and medications containing
alcohol) will not be considered lawfully used when taken by a covered
employee and detected by a test conducted under this policy.
4. Once notified of a drug test required by the Town (or applicable
Federal regulations) employees must remain available for contact by
the MRO and/or the Town and are required to make contact with the
Town at least daily. Failure to do either shall be cause for disciplinary
action up to and including termination of employment.
5. Covered employees may request the split sample to be tested by a
different (DHHS certified) lab if such a request is made within 72
hours of notification by the Town (or by the MRO) of a verified
positive. Pending the outcome of the retest, the employee remains
unqualified to work in any safety-sensitive position at the Town.
E. REPORTING AND RECORD KEEPING
1. The results of all alcohol and controlled substances tests will be
considered confidential and will be maintained in a secure location
with controlled access. A covered employee is entitled, upon written
request, to obtain copies of any records pertaining to the employee's
use of alcohol or controlled substances.
2. The Town is required to provide information about test results (and
any refusal to submit to testing) to or upon the direction of regulatory
agencies, as required by regulations and upon written request by the
person tested. The covered employee may be required to provide
permission for the release of information by the Town under certain
circumstances including (but not limited to) an application for
employment with another Town. In addition, the covered employee
may be required to provide such permission to previous employers for
release of such information to the Town.

SECTION IX REQUIREMENT TO SUBMIT TO TESTING
A. Covered employees are required to submit to all drug and/or alcohol testing
required by the Town (or applicable State and Federal regulations).
SECTION X REFUSAL TO SUBMIT TO TESTING
A. Refusal to submit to such drug and/or alcohol testing will be cause for
disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment.
B. Refusal to submit to testing includes the failure (without a valid medical
explanation) to provide adequate (breath or urine) specimens for alcohol or
drug testing after receiving notice of the requirement for testing, or engaging
in conduct (including failure to cooperate) that clearly obstructs the testing
process. Substitution or adulteration of a urine specimen are examples of a
refusal to submit a specimen.
SECTION XI CONSEQUENCES OF VIOLATING THIS POLICY
A. Covered employees who engage in prohibited conduct hereunder, or who
otherwise violate this policy (or the alcohol or controlled substance rules of
any DOT agency), are subject to disciplinary action up to and including
termination of employment with the Town. At a minimum, however, such
employees shall be immediately suspended from performing any safetysensitive
functions with the Town. Covered employees should be aware that
repeated violation of these policies will ordinarily result in termination of
employment.
B. Except unless the violation is limited to a positive test for alcohol with a
concentration of 0.02 or greater but less than 0.04, in which case the
following section 1.12 shall apply, such employees shall be prohibited from
performing safety-sensitive functions with the Town until the following
requirements are met:
1. The employee must evaluated by a substance abuse professional
(SAP) who will determine what assistance (if any) the employee needs
in resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled
substance use;
2. The employee must comply with all recommendations or
requirements of the SAP;

D. Applicants who violate this policy will be considered ineligible for hire or
transfer to a safety-sensitive position with Town unless they have (in addition
to meeting any other Town requirements) satisfied the requirements 1
through 4 above.
SECTION XII ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION OF 0.02 - 0.04
A. If the violation is limited to an alcohol concentration of 0.02 or greater but
less than 0.04, the employee will not be permitted to perform any safety
sensitive function for the Town until testing below 0.02, or until the start of
the employee's next regular shift, but not less than 24 hours following a
testing result between 0.02 and 0.04.
SECTION XIII REFERRAL
A. A covered employee who engages in prohibited conduct will be given the
names, addresses and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals
and counseling programs available to evaluate and resolve drug and alcohol
related problems. The covered employee shall be evaluated by a substance
abuse professional who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee
needs in resolving problems associated with drug or alcohol misuse. The
New Hampshire Municipal Health Trust sponsors such programs and can be
reached by calling 1-800-527-5001.

SECTION XIV USE OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
A. Covered employees shall inform their foreman or supervisor at any time they
are using a controlled substance which their physician has prescribed for
therapeutic purposes. Such covered employees shall not be permitted to
perform safety-sensitive functions unless a physician, who is knowledgeable
the duties of the employee, has informed the town in writing that use of the
controlled substance will not adversely affect the employee’s ability to
perform his or her safety-sensitive functions.
SECTION XV THE EFFECTS OF ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED
SUBSTANCES USE
A. The Town will provide information and training to covered employees as to
the effects of alcohol misuse and controlled substances use on health, work,
and personal life; signs and symptoms of an alcohol or a controlled substance
problem; and available methods of intervening when an alcohol or a
controlled substances problem is expected (including confrontation) and
referral to any employee assistance resources available to the employee or
his/her dependents. Such information shall be provided prior to the first
request for a test administered under this policy.

Section I: Introduction
The welfare, health and safety of our employees are a prime concerns of the Town of
Londonderry and its management. Avoiding illnesses, accidents and injuries that may
result in unnecessary suffering, loss of wages, work days and all too often permanent
disability is of paramount importance to the Town and to its effective and efficient
operation.
The Town recognizes the critical importance of its employees in achieving its mission
and goals. We are justifiably proud of our employees and genuinely concerned for their
health, safety and well-being. We rely on each employee's judgment and responsibility
to provide the best possible services to our community. We recognize that every
employee is critical to and accountable for the success of the Town’s Safety Program.
This Safety Program is meant to enhance prevention of work place injuries, illnesses
and accidents. Following the rules and procedures outlined in this program should
result in a safer working environment for all Town employees. It is recognized and
understood that the inherent dangerous duties of emergency first responders (i.e. Police
& Fire) will at times cause these particular town employees to operate outside the scope
of some of these rules and procedures. Additional safety measures you will note in this
program include but are not limited to: implementation of a town-wide seat belt policy,
enforced usage of all protective gear and equipment, safety education, continuation of a
Joint Loss Management Committee to monitor, promote and recommend changes to
enhance workplace safety and training and education on preventing workplace
incidents and maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
Because of the importance of workplace safety to all Town employees, the Town itself
and members of the public who violate any safety rule, policy or procedure will not be
ignored and will be subject to disciplinary action, up and including termination.
4
Section II: Management Commitment
Workplace safety is as important to in our workplace as all other job functions. It is the
Town’s belief that with adequate education, training and awareness almost all
workplace accidents, illnesses and injuries should be preventable. Working safely is a
condition of employment of every Town employee. The Town recognizes the
importance of training and educating every employee on safety aspects relative to their
job duties and strives to provide each employee with safety training and education
related to their job responsibilities. In addition to preventing its employees from
having to endure needless pain and suffering by preventing workplace accidents,
injuries and illnesses by adhering to safe workplace practices the Town should save
money which can then be put to other uses for the benefit of the Town, its citizens and
its employees.
All management personnel of the Town are accountable for the success of the Town’s
Safety Program. Success and enforcement of the provisions of this Program are an
essential function of the job duties of all Town management employees, and are a part
of the evaluation of management employees.
The Town and each of its management employees are fully committed to the Town’s
Safety Program and its goal of avoiding workplace illnesses, accidents and injuries.
5
Section III: Responsibilities of Town and Employees

their co-workers and the general public they come in contact with in their job. While
the Town and its managers has ultimate responsibility for the overall success of the
Town’s workplace Safety Program, every Town employee is also responsible for and is
important to the success of this Program. Below are the general responsibilities each

12
Section VI- Disciplinary Policy
An employee’s violation of any safety/health rule or policy will be treated in the same
manner as an employee’s violation of any other employment rule or policy.
A hard or soft copy of this Safety Policy will be given to every current Town employee
following its enactment. In addition, in the event there is an approved revision to this
Safety Policy a hard or soft copy with change summary outlining changes will be given
to every current Town Employee. New hires will be given a copy of the Town’s Safety
Program when they begin employment.
It is the duty of every employee to become aware of all aspects and requirements of this
Safety Program. All employees’ efforts to follow this Safety Program will result in
helping make the Town of Londonderry a safer place to work. Any questions regarding
this Program should be directed to your Department Head, Joint Loss Management
Committee Representative or the Town Manager, who all three will work in
conjunction with HR.
Any violations of this Safety Program will be disciplined pursuant to the applicable
disciplinary and grievance procedure outlined in the employee’s collective bargaining
agreement with the Town. In the case where there is no applicable
disciplinary/grievance procedure, the Town will usually take disciplinary action in the
following order:
? First violation, a verbal warning which may be reduced to writing and placed
in the employee’s personnel file;
? Second violation, a written warning;
? Third violation, suspension;
? Fourth violation, termination.
However, the Town need not follow the above order if it determines that the infraction
is severe or willful enough to skip one or more of the above listed steps, and the Town
may impose less severe discipline if it determines that is warranted. At each step, the
employee will be provided a review of the safety guidelines and a description of what
(s)he has done wrong.
Department Heads and Supervisors are responsible for counseling employees as
problems occur. Employees are responsible to ask their department head and/or
supervisor any questions they have on any safety or health matter. All of our efforts
together will result in helping to make the Town of Londonderry a safer place to work.
13
Section VII- Accident and Incident Investigations
The Town’s most important goal in accident and incident investigations is to find out
what happened to prevent recurrences.
Accident and incident investigations may be conducted by any member of management
or their designees and members of the Joint Loss Management Committee applicable to
the accident or incident in order to determine what, when, where, how and why it
happened and what, if anything, can be done to prevent it from happening again.
Accident and Incident Investigations will include the following as appropriate:
? Inspections of where it occurred;
? Interviews of any victims and witnesses as soon as possible/appropriate after
the occurrence;
? Photographs or other visual or audio’s of anyone or anything relevant to
what occurred including location and equipment;
? Samples of any substance or matter involved;
? A report of the accident or incident including any determination as to
cause(s); and
? Any recommendations on ways to prevent a recurrence.
14
Section VIII- Training Requirements for Safety and Health
The Town recognizes the importance to itself, its employees and members of the public
that every employee is trained and able to perform their job duties safely at all times.
No employee should ever use or work with any vehicle, machinery or equipment of any
kind in the workplace that they do not know how or are not able to use safely. Under
no circumstance is any employee to ever use any hazardous equipment or materials for
which they have not been trained to use safely. Any employee that believes they don’t
know how or cannot safely perform any of their job duties or who believes any vehicle,
machinery or equipment of any kind in the workplace is unsafe must immediately
bring the matter to their immediate supervisors attention, or in the absence of their
immediate supervisor they must bring the matter to the attention of another member of
Town management.
In general, the Town provides and requires its employees to participate in safety and
health training with respect to any substance, equipment or circumstance that the Town
believes may present a safety or health hazard to an employee or a member of the
public.
15
Section IX- Emergency Evacuation
Emergency Evacuation Plans (EEP) have been posted in each department. Department
Heads are responsible to review the EEP with their staff. These plans display
evacuation routes and gathering areas for each workspace and are posted near the
entrances of each town facility. Staff members exiting the buildings should follow these
plans.
The process to confirm everyone has exited the building will be as follows:
Town Hall:
? Each Department Head will be the point of contact for their Department and
should report to Town Manager or Administrative Support Coordinator the
status of their staff after all employees have exited the building. In the
Department Head’s absence, a representative should be designated.
? Town Manager or Administrative Support Coordinator will be the first line of
contact with emergency response personnel.
? Emergency Response Personnel will determine if the building is safe to re-enter.
Library/Access Center/Senior Center/Highway Garage:
? Department Head and/or Supervisor will be the point of contact for their
specific facility and should report to Emergency Response Command the status
of their staff after all employees have exited the building. In the Department
Head’s/Supervisor absence, a representative should be designated.
? Emergency Response Personnel will determine if the building is safe to re-enter.
? Town Manager or Administrative Support Coordinator should be notified of the
incident as soon as possible.
Police Department & Fire Department Facilities:
? Will follow their internal Fire Alarm and Emergency Evacuation Policies.
? Town Manager or Administrative Support Coordinator should be notified of the
incident as soon as possible.
The Standard Operating Procedures for Emergency Response Personnel will apply.
16
Section IX – Safety and Health Communication
The Town believes that key to the success of its Safety Program is an open line of
communication between employees and Town management on any safety or health
matter that affects our workplace.
As set forth in the Town’s Accident and Incident Reporting policy included in this
Safety Program, employees are required to report all workplace accidents, injuries,
illnesses and "near misses" to their immediate supervisors, in accordance with the
guidelines in Appendix I.3 Accident Reporting and Investigation.
Any employee that believes they don’t know how or cannot safely perform any of their
job duties or who believes any vehicle, machinery or equipment of any kind in the
workplace is unsafe must immediately bring the matter to their immediate supervisors
attention, or in the absence of their immediate supervisor they must bring the matter to
the attention of another member of Town management. (See Section VIII of this Safety
Policy- Training Requirements for Safety and Health)
Employees should complete and submit the Town’s Safety Recommendation and
Suggestion Form for any concerns they have on any workplace health or safety issue.
The Town will keep employees informed on issues of safety and health by:
? Providing every employee with a copy of its Safety Program;
? Distributing information from its Joint Loss Management and Wellness
Committees;
? Posting safety and health signs and posters
? Distributing workplace health and safety information to employees in a timely
and appropriate manner such as at department meetings, posting on bulletin
boards and through e-mails.

automatic seat belt shall face disciplinary action in accordance with the Personnel Rules
and Policies of the Town of Londonderry.
18
Appendix I.2: Smoke Free Workplace Policy
In compliance with New Hampshire’s Indoor Smoking Act and to protect the health of
our employees, the Town prohibits smoking in all town facilities. Secondhand smoke
has been linked to an increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease in nonsmokers.
In view of this, the following policy shall provide for a smoke free workplace.
The smoking of tobacco, in any form, shall be prohibited within the confines of any
Town owned or leased facility. Smoking in town-owned vehicles is also prohibited,
unless otherwise permitted by the Town Manager.
Town employees shall not be allowed to smoke while performing the duties of their job.
Breaks for smoking are allowed only during designated work breaks.
Any employee found to be in violation of this policy is subject to the disciplinary policy
of the Town. Department heads shall be responsible for the enforcement of this policy.
Smokers will be provided with an appropriate outdoor smoking area as designated by
the Department Head. Such areas shall have installed and maintained appropriate
waste receptacles for the proper and safe disposal of smoking materials.
19
Appendix I.3: Accident Reporting and Investigation
Supervisors and/or Department Heads:
1. Will be responsible for ensuring that sufficient information is gathered accurately
and in detail in order to submit a comprehensive report of the cause of the
accident and/or injury and that the Accident/Injury Reporting form (See
Appendix II for Form), as well as a detailed investigation report, are completed.
2. Shall follow the Claims Processing Procedure, and submit an Employee Personal
Accident/Injury/Illness Notification Form, as well as any other pertinent
information within the next business day of the accident or injury.
Recommendations to prevent recurrence should be made at this time.
3. Proper submittal of the Employee Personal Accident/Injury/Illness Notification
Form to Human Resources will ensure that the Employer First Report of Injury is
filed within the timeframe allow by the State of New Hampshire Department of
Labor. This is the first notification to the town that a job-related injury or illness
has been sustained and it is extremely important in the prompt processing of a
claim. Fines may be assessed by the State if claims are not filed in a timely
manner.
4. Accident/Injury files shall be kept for all departments by Human Resources and
an aggregate report brought to the quarterly Joint Loss Management and
Wellness Committee meetings for review, comments and recommendations.
5. Injuries requiring simple first aid must also have an Accident/Injury Report
form on file and be catalogued for review at the quarterly Committee meeting.
6. Supervisors are instructed to abide by and enforce all safety rules and
regulations provided by the State of New Hampshire, Department of Labor,
including Administrative Rule 277- "Safety and Health of Public Employees", Lab
1400 rules, Administrative Rules for Safety and Health, Lab 600 rules, Safety
Programs, RSA 277A, Employees Right to Know, RSA 281-A:64, Safety Provision
and RSA 155-A, State Building Codes.
Employees
1. Judgment is a key factor in the handling of emergencies. Everyone is expected to
exercise sound judgment based upon the circumstances. If there is any question
or doubt about the seriousness of any injury, call the appropriate agency for help.
2. It is the duty of every employee to report all workplace accidents, injuries,
illnesses and "near misses" to their immediate supervisor or Department Head.
No injury or near miss resulting from a preventable safety hazard should be
20
considered too minor. Be advised, if you seek medical attention due to a jobrelated
injury or illness, that you must inform the physician and/or hospital that
it is a Workers’ Compensation Claim.
3. Ensure that the proper first aid and emergency care is provided until the
emergency services personnel arrive. All employees are encouraged to learn
primary First Aid Training, either through the American Red Cross or periodic
classes of the Londonderry Fire Department.
4. Secure the area, when practical, to prevent additional injuries from occurring.
5. Notify your immediate supervisor when the situation is secured.
6. Ensure that you follow the Claims Processing Procedures, and file an Employee
Personal Accident/Injury/Illness Notification Form during the same shift in
which the injury occurred, but no later than the next business day. Failure to do
so will result in a delay in your claim and benefits.
7. Employees shall be required to use proper lifting techniques to avoid back injury.
This includes bending the knees while lifting to relieve the pressure on the lower
back. Objects that are too heavy should not be lifted alone; in this event,
employees shall request help.
8. Employees are encouraged to voluntarily receive primary First Aid training. The
course is available through the American Red Cross and periodically through the
Londonderry Fire Department.
9. All equipment shall be cleaned and inspected for malfunction on a regular basis.
Incident Investigations
1. The immediate supervisor will investigate all accidents, incidents, illnesses and
"near misses" which occur within the span of their control. The purpose of this
investigation is to determine what happened, why it happened, and most
importantly, how to prevent it from happening again.
2. An Accident/Investigation Report shall be completed if the accident is serious in
nature or had the potential to cause serious injury or damage. Any recognized
problem should be put forth at the next Joint Loss Management and Wellness
Committee meeting. Prepare recommendations wherever possible.
3. Investigate the scene as soon as possible after the accident/incident noting
conditions, location of equipment, physical objects and witnesses. Make notes
and sketches or take photographs as needed.
21
4. Interview witnesses soon after the accident/incident occurs so the facts will be
fresh in their mind. Be certain that they understand that no blame is being laid.
You (the supervisor) are simply trying to gather the facts to prevent a recurrence.
5. Interview the victim when the timing is right. Keep in mind his/her physical
and emotional condition.
6. Make recommendations to prevent similar occurrences. Terms such as
"employee was careless" are inadequate and prevent accurate reporting.
Remember, this is a factual report, details are necessary to ensure accuracy as
well as provide the opportunity to put forth productive, preventive
recommendations.
7. The supervisor shall be responsible for following up with investigations and
ensuring the completion of paperwork is sent to Human Resources in a timely
manner. A copy of all final paperwork shall be given to the employee for their
own records by the supervisor.
22
Appendix I.4: Temporary Alternate Duty
TOWN OF Londonderry
TEMPORARY ALTERNATE DUTY PROGRAM
In accordance with the provisions of RSA 281-A: 23-b, the Town of Londonderry will provide
temporary alternative work opportunities for employees who suffer a work-related injury or
illness.
When practicable, employees will be returned to their regular duties with modifications
consistent with a physician’s stipulated work restrictions. In the event that such restrictions
make it impractical for an employee to perform their normal job, even with modification, the
employee may be reassigned to different duties or a different work schedule and may
include assignment to a different department with the Town of Londonderry.
The specific assignment of duties shall be determined on a case-by-case basis pursuant to
the physician’s restrictions and the work available at the time of the injury or illness.
The Town of Londonderry has no obligation to provide temporary alternative work
opportunities to employees who suffer a non-work related injury or illness.
I HEREBY ACKNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE RECEIVED A COPY OF THE TEMPORARY
ALTERNATE DUTY PROGRAM AND THAT MY RESPONSIBILITIES WERE EXPLAINED
TO ME.
EMPLOYEE SIGNATURE__________________________DATE_____________
23
Appendix I.5: Building/Job Site Inspection Criteria
Inspections of work areas, processes and equipment are to be conducted at least twice
annually by the Department Head or appointed inspector. This shall include building
inspections, safety procedure checks and equipment safety checks.
Job site inspections shall be conducted prior to the start of any new project that may use
heavy equipment, power hand tools, or may in any way be considered potentially
hazardous.
Any employee who witnesses unsafe working practices or conditions is required to
report the practice or condition as soon as possible to their immediate supervisor.
Employees are also encouraged to use the available Suggestion/Recommendation form
(See Appendix II for Form) to suggest changes that will aid in increasing
worker/workplace safety.
If, in the process of an inspection, a hazard has been witnessed, it is the duty of the
inspector to take the appropriate actions necessary to ensure against injury or accident,
(i.e., remove the tool from service, post warning signs, etc.)
If the inspector is unable to make the necessary corrections, steps shall be taken to
correct the problem and report the results to the Department Head. It should then be
reported along with any recommendations to the Department Head for further action.
All Building Inspection Reports and recommendations for action should be filed with
the department's Joint Loss Management Committee representative for review at the
next scheduled Committee meeting.
24
Appendix I.6: Exposure to Bodily Fluids/Infectious Diseases
The objective of this policy is to limit exposure to infectious disease and address
measures to prevent exposure to bodily fluids. This policy applies to any employee
who comes into contact with an infected person or material. Emergency personnel are
subject to state reporting guidelines when exposed to an infectious disease. Specific
department policies may exceed these measures and should be adhered to.
Preventive Measures
Microshields, or pocket masks, must be used when administering CPR or Rescue
Breathing before the arrival of properly trained emergency personnel. These masks will
not be reused.
Disposable personal protective gloves will be worn in any case where the possibility
exists for the transmittal of an infectious disease. Upon using the gloves they shall be
disposed of in a marked plastic trash bag. Personnel shall then wash their hands with
hot water and soap.
Alcare disinfectant foam shall be used according to the manufacturer's instructions, if
you get bodily fluids on an exposed area of your hands not protected by gloves.
Reporting
Emergency response/public safety workers who, while in the line of duty, sustain an
unprotected exposure or who suspect such an exposure shall report the incident to a
supervisor. The exposed worker must also provide a copy of the emergency
response/public safety worker incident report form to his/her medical referral
consultant. If the source individual is transported to a health care facility, licensed
under RSA 151, the exposed worker shall provide a copy of the incident report to the
infectious control officer of the facility.
Any exposure to a bodily fluid by a public safety worker, whether infectious or not,
must be documented on the Fire/Police Department's Exposure to Bodily Fluids Form
and the State of New Hampshire's Exposure Report Form. The exposed employee must
take proper precautions to clean the affected area, for example but not limited to:
taking a shower, flushing the area, washing with hot water and soap.
Completed State forms should be given to the Infectious Control Officer or the
Department Head for delivery to the hospital immediately after filing. Most Emergency
Rooms have a place to drop off these forms.
The Londonderry Fire Department Standard Operating Procedure #306.00 gives a
complete accounting of applicable state laws and reporting procedures.
25
Appendix I.7: Panic Button/Violence in the Workplace Policy
In an effort to provide a safe work environment each employee workstation of the
Town Office is equipped with a Panic Alarm. All panic alarms are numbered. A listing
of numbered panic alarms and assigned location is maintained in the Town Manager’s
Department and Police Department. The Police Department also has a Town Office
floor plan with location of numbered panic alarms noted on the map.
Employees are instructed as to the location of and how to use the panic alarms within
their department. It is the responsibility of the Department Head to ensure all new
employees are instructed on the location of the panic alarms within their department.
Each conference room has a panic alarm in a clearly marked location. Annually, notice
will be sent to the Chairperson of the Committee to instruct him/her of the locations of
the panic alarm and instructions on use.
Panic Alarm testing will be conducted annually in conjunction with Safety Week. The
testing will include testing each alarm to ensure they are in operation, as well as, a
random testing of alarms.
Violence in the Workplace
The safety and security of all employees is of primary importance at the Town of
Londonderry. Threats, stalking, threatening and abusive behavior, or acts of violence
against employees, visitors, customers [clients], and/or town facilities or property by
anyone on town property, on a town controlled site, or in connection with town
employment or town business will not be tolerated (even those made in jest). Violations
of this policy will lead to corrective action up to and including termination and/or
referral to appropriate law enforcement agencies for arrest and prosecution. Town of
Londonderry reserves the right to take any necessary legal action to protect its
employees.
Any person who makes threats, stalks, exhibits threatening behavior, or engages in
violent acts on town premises, on a town-controlled site, or in connection with town
employment or town business shall be removed from the premises as quickly as safety
permits and shall remain off town premises pending the outcome of an investigation.
Following investigation, the organization will initiate an immediate and appropriate
response. This response may include but is not limited to suspension and/or
termination of any town relationship, reassignment of job duties, suspension or
termination of employment, and/or civil or criminal prosecution of the person or
persons involved.
All employees are responsible for notifying management of any threats that they
witness or receive or that they are told another person witnessed or received. Even
without a specific threat, all employees should report any behavior they have witnessed
26
that they regard as potentially threatening or violent or that could endanger the health
or safety of an employee when the behavior has been carried out on town premises, on
a town-controlled site, or is connected to town employment or town business.
Employees are responsible for making this report regardless of the relationship between
the individual who initiated the threatening behavior and the person or persons being
threatened. [NOTE: This addresses one spouse or family member threatening and/or
harming another.]
The organization understands the sensitivity of the information requested and has
developed confidentiality procedures that recognize and respect the privacy of the
reporting employee.
[NOTE: You cannot promise absolute confidentiality because you may have to report
this to a law enforcement agency, other governmental agency, etc. However, you want
to maintain the anonymity of the reporting individual when at all possible.]
27
Appendix I.8: Toxic Substances in the Workplace
277-A:1 – "Worker's Right to Know Act''
HAZARD COMMUNICATION PROGRAM
Hazardous and Toxic Substances
Employees who might be exposed to toxic substances during the course of their work
shall be informed of the nature and hazards of these substances in accordance with
N.H. RSA 277-A "Worker's Right to Know Law."
Engineering and administrative controls shall be implemented, whenever feasible, to
maintain concentration levels below the levels established by the American Conference
of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH), 1995-96 and published in "Threshold
Limit Values for Chemical Substances and Physical Agents in the Work Environment".
When engineering and administrative controls are not feasible to achieve acceptable
levels, protective equipment shall be used to keep the exposure of employees below the
established limits.
This policy and procedure relates to Hazard Communication compliance by compiling
hazardous chemical lists, by using Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS's), by ensuring
that containers are labeled, and by providing employees with training.
Policy
All Managers/Supervisors or their designee will coordinate the Hazard
Communication Program within their respective departments by ensuring that
containers are labeled properly, compiling a hazardous chemicals list, and providing
employees with training.
The Town-Wide Safety Committee will review and update the program which is
outlined below, as necessary. Copies of the written program will be located within each
Town building.
Under this program, employees will be informed of:
? The contents of the hazard communication standard;
? The hazardous properties of in-house chemicals with which they work;
? Safe handling procedures;
? Measures to take to protect you from these chemicals.
28
List of In-House Hazardous Chemicals:
The Department Heads or their designee will ensure that a list of all hazardous
chemicals used in any Town building is complied, and will update the list as necessary.
The list of chemicals identifies all of the chemicals used in each facility. Each list also
identifies the corresponding MSDS for all chemicals. A master list of these chemicals
will be located in a dedicated office of each Town building and at the Fire Department
dayroom at the Safety Complex as the MSDS index.
Material Safety Data Sheets:
MSDS's provide employees with specific information on chemicals they may be
exposed to. The Department Heads will maintain a binder in each facility with an
MSDS on every substance on the list of hazardous chemicals MSDS Index.
Each Department Head or their designee shall be responsible for acquiring and
updating MSDS's. The Department Heads shall contact the chemical manufacturer or
vendor if additional research is necessary or if an MSDS has not been supplied with an
initial shipment received by the Town.
Labels:
The Department Heads or their designee shall ensure and verify that all containers
received for use are properly labeled (NFPA 704 label) as to the contents, note the
appropriate hazard warning and list the name and address of the manufacturer,
importer, or responsible party.
If you transfer chemicals from a labeled container to a portable container that is
intended only for your immediate use, labels are not required on the portable
container.
Training:
Department personnel who work with or are potentially exposed to in-house hazardous
chemicals will receive initial training on the Hazard Communication Program and the
safe use of those hazardous chemicals by the Department Heads or his or her designee.
Employees will be required to sign a form to verify that they have received training,
received written material, and understand the policies on hazard communication.
29
Contractor Employees:
Each contractor bringing chemicals on-site must provide the Town with the appropriate
hazard information on these substances, including the labels used and the
precautionary measures to be taken in working with these chemicals.
Handling Chemicals
All employees should be aware that all chemical products may be potentially harmful
or dangerous if improperly mixed or applied or when used without protective
equipment or in a manner not consistent with the manufacturers guidelines. Many
commonly used products not commonly regarded as "hazardous" are, in fact, chemicals
and can cause injury if not properly used. Extreme care should be used at all times by
personnel who are working with acids, caustics, solvents, pesticides, toxic, petroleum
based or other chemical products (specific rules for certain activities and/or use of
specific chemicals are provided in departmental safety policies and procedures).
Basic safety information relating to the usage of chemicals is outlined as follows:
? Material Safety Data Sheets (MSDS) will be obtained from the manufacturer or
supplier for all hazardous chemical products used by the Town of Londonderry.
? The MSDS will be kept in the appropriate departments and made available to
Employees on request.
? Always consult the MSDS before working with a new product. The MSDS
provides information on the product such as: the physical and health hazards,
proper handling methods, spill cleanup data, fire fighting information and
required protective equipment.
? Never mix chemical products unless it is safe to do so. Many common products
are incompatible or become unstable when mixed. Consult the MSDS or ask a
knowledgeable superior.
? First aid information is provided on the MSDS. Take the MSDS and/or product
label with you to the doctor or hospital if you suffer an injury or illness due to
contact with or exposure to a chemical.
? All containers of chemicals must be labeled.
? When using small quantities of a chemical, use the entire chemical or return it to
the original container.
? Never leave any quantity of hazardous material in an unlabeled or improper
container.
? No food or drink shall be allowed in areas where potentially toxic or harmful
chemicals are stored, mixed or otherwise handled.
? Caution should be used to avoid spills or splashes when handling
chemicals. Spilled chemicals should be cleaned up and properly disposed of
immediately.
30
? Wash hands frequently.
? Wear protective clothing, respiratory protection, rubber gloves, protective
goggles and face shield when required. The safe way to handle chemicals is as if
they are all dangerous.
? Ensure adequate ventilation. Do not use chemicals, which release toxic, noxious
or harmful vapors or fumes in a confined space or an area, which is not
adequately ventilated.
? Keep fire and flames away from flammable materials. Smoke only in authorized
areas.
? In case of a chemical fire, use only the correct extinguishing agent. Be aware of
noxious or toxic fumes. If a fire cannot be safely and quickly extinguished, notify
the Fire Department and leave the area.
? If you are exposed to a chemical product, take immediate first aid precautions
and seek medical assistance. First aid information is provided on the
MSDS. Take the MSDS and/or product label with you to the doctor or hospital.
? If acid or caustic materials come in contact with the eyes or skin, flush
immediately with large amounts of water. Get medical attention for any eye
injury.
31
Appendix I.9 Lock Out
This policy is to establish the minimum requirements for the locking out of energy sources
whenever maintenance or servicing is done on machines or equipment. It shall be used to
ensure that the machine or equipment is stopped, isolated from all potentially hazardous
energy sources and locked out before employees perform any servicing or maintenance where
the unexpected energization or start-up of the machine or equipment or release of stored energy
could cause injury.
Policy
Prior to performing repairs or maintenance on any equipment, workers shall take every
precaution to protect themselves and others from injury. Employees must refer to
individual departmental procedure. Department Heads or their designee shall be
responsible to ensure proper training is being adhered to.
Procedure
Make a survey to locate and identify all isolating devices to be certain which switch(s), valve(s),
or other energy isolating devices apply to the equipment to be locked/tagged out. More than
one energy source (electrical, mechanical, or others) may be involved.
Lock out the energy isolating device(s) with assigned individual lock(s), the design, purpose,
and use of which the employee shall have been trained on prior to use.
Lockout devices, where used, shall be affixed in a manner that will hold the energy isolating
devices in a “safe” or “off” position.
Tag out devices, where used, shall be affixed in such a manner as will clearly indicate that the
operation or movement of energy isolating devices from the “safe” or “off” position is
prohibited.
Where a tag cannot be affixed directly to the energy isolating device, the tag shall be located as
close as safely possible to the device, in a position that will be immediately obvious to anyone
attempting to operate the device.
Restoring Equipment to Service Procedure:
? Check the machine or equipment and the immediate area around the machine or
equipment to ensure that nonessential items have been removed and that the machine or
equipment components are operationally intact.
? Check the work area to ensure that all employees have been safely positioned or
removed from the area.
? Verify that the controls are in neutral.
? Only the individual who is working on the equipment shall be allowed to remove the
lockout devices and reenergize the machine or equipment.
32
Appendix I.10 Confined Space
TOWN OF LONDONDERRY
Confined Space Entry
This Confined Space Entry policy is to provide a safe work environment in designated
confined spaces. A confined space is any limited entry containing known or potential
hazards, which is not intended for continuous human occupancy.
Policy
All employees are prohibited from entering confined space work areas (See New
Hampshire Department of Labor Standard 1402 and 1403). Any work involving
entering confined space shall be contracted out to a third party contractor who is
trained and qualified to work in a confined space work area.
Procedure
1. Outsourced to a third party contractor who is trained and qualified to work in
confined space work areas.
2. The Town of Londonderry Public Works Department in conjunction with the
Fire Department shall attempt to identify known confined spaces owned by the
Town and shall post warning signs at entrances to said spaces. The sign shall
read: DANGER – CONFINED SPACE – ENTRY BY PERMIT ONLY!
Note:
The Londonderry Fire Department for rescue purposes in Confined Space(s) adheres to
OSHA CFR 1910-146 and 147. The Londonderry Fire Department Standard Operating
Procedure #306.00 gives a complete accounting of this policy.

Managing Workers’ Compensation – Claim Processing Procedure
1. EMPLOYEE IMMEDIATELY REPORTS INJURY/ILLNESS TO THEIR DEPARTMENT
HEAD/SUPERVISOR.
2. THE INJURED EMPLOYEE AND DEPARTMENT HEAD/SUPERVISOR COMPLETE THE
Employee Personal Accident/Injury/Illness Notification Form and provides copy to Human
Resources during the same shift in which the injury occurred, if possible; but no later than the
next business day. If Department Head/Supervisor is provided with incomplete forms, please
follow up with the employee regarding missing information. Please be aware that the Town is
required by law to file all workers’ compensation claims within five (5) days of the incident,
therefore, cooperation from everyone is necessary to process the claims in a timely manner.
3. DEPARTMENT HEAD/SUPERVISOR INFORMS INJURED EMPLOYEE that the Town of
Londonderry Workers’ Compensation provider is not a managed care origination that directs
injured workers to a specific physician, facility or pharmacy. Instead, employees are free to treat
with providers of their choosing, if he/she requires medical attention. If the injured employee
does needs assistance in choosing a network provider, please see Human Resources who will
direct you to the on-line tool to select a provider. In either case, the injured employee following
each exam and/or treatment, assure that the provider completes the New Hampshire Workers’
Compensation Medical Form; and give the injured employee the “Employer” copy, and the
injured employee must immediately provide the “Employer” copy to Department
Head/Supervisor and/or Human Resources. Human Resources will send or fax copy to Town of
Londonderry Workers’ Compensation provider.
4. HUMAN RESOURCES WILL COMPLETE THE “Employer’s First Report of Injury” form, and
fax or send copies to the Town of Londonderry Workers’ Compensation provider. The Town of
Londonderry Workers’ Compensation provider will forward to the Department of Labor, as
required.
5. HUMAN RESOURCES WILL COMPLETE THE “Employer’s Supplemental Report of Injury”
form and fax or send copies to the Department of Labor and the Town of Londonderry Workers’
Compensation provider.

c. When there is any change in the employee’s work status (i.e. employee returns to
work to temporary alternative duties or from temporary alternative duties to
regular duty).
6. Based on activity restrictions defined by the provider, the EMPLOYEE’S DEPARTMENT
HEAD/SUPERVISOR AND/OR HUMAN RESOURCES WILL PURSUE TEMPORARY
ALTERNATIVE WORK OPPORTUNITIES for the injured employee within their department or
elsewhere in the workplace. Job tasks of temporary alternative work need to be clearly
communicated and understood between the employee, his/her supervisor and Human
Resources. To facilitate return to work, the employer may need to complete a New Hampshire
Workers’ Compensation Task Analysis Form, to relay to the provider the physical requirements
54
of a particular work assignment. Any reported difficulties with assigned tasks should be
mutually resolved at the worksite and/or with Human Resources (The Town of Londonderry
Workers’ Compensation provider should be notified if the difficulties cannot be resolved).
If the employee does not return to the alternative work assignment, the employer (Human
Resources) will notify The Town of Londonderry Workers’ Compensation provider by phone as
soon as possible.
For each follow-up appointment, the provider should complete a New Hampshire Workers’
Compensation Medical Form. Temporary Alternative Duty (TAD) assignments are to be
adjusted based on changes in the employee’s activity restrictions or physical capacities.
Following each exam and treatment, the injured employee must provide the completed New
Hampshire Workers’ Compensation Medical Form to the Department Head/Supervisor and
Human Resources in order to send or fax to The Town of Londonderry Workers’ Compensation
provider.

with the person(s) engaging in the offensive conduct. Employees who are offended by
conduct are encouraged, but not required, to inform the person(s) engaging in the conduct
of the unacceptable nature of the conduct in a professional, civil manner. This discussion
may resolve the issue, but even if it is resolved the matter must still be reported through
the Reporting Procedure.
C. Consequences for Violating the Policy: Violations of this policy, whether intended or
not, will not be tolerated. Any employee who violates this policy will be subject to
corrective and/or disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment.
Note that the Town may take corrective and/or disciplinary action to address
inappropriate conduct even if it does not rise to the level of unlawful harassment.
D. Retaliation will not be Tolerated: The Town of Londonderry requires employees to
report violations of this policy and will not tolerate any form of retaliation against an
employee who makes a report or who participates in an investigation of a report under
this policy. All incidents of retaliation must be immediately reported using the Reporting
Procedure.

expenditures, the circumstances and justification for all purchases to the

SECTION V ADVERTISED COMPETITIVE SELECTION

are periodically removed from service and disposed of in light of obsolescence.

value in a timely and equitable fashion once their usefulness to the Town has ended. If

possession of any item to allow checks to clear.
SECTION VII AWARD
A. The award of a contract or purchase, or sale of Town property, follows the competitive
selection process. Consistent with the other provisions of these guidelines, the criteria for
award are flexible enough to allow consideration of all factors involved, yet still provide
a clear sense of public policy intent.
B. Purchasing - After bids or proposals have been received through the competitive selection
process, the bids or proposals must be reviewed for completeness. The bids or proposals
must be reviewed to determine how well they meet the specifications or scope of work,
the input from references, or other aspects indicating the overall ability of the prospective
vendor to provide the goods or service desired.
1. In all cases, the goal of the award shall be to select the vendor offering the
best overall value to the Town; the “lowest, best” bidder. Price, quality,
service, and experience, either demonstrated through other clients or with
the Town of Londonderry, should be included in the determination of
award.

be reviewed with the Purchasing Agent prior to the purchasing process. Specifications
must adequately define the operating characteristics, performance requirements, or scope
of work to be performed. They should not be so specific as to unnecessarily restrict
competition, but complete enough to represent superior value for the Town.

or services should be reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. All specifications
for products or services should be placed on file with the Purchasing Agent.

6. To provide care for a covered service member with a serious injury or illness
if the employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent or next of kin of the
covered service member (“Military Caregiver Leave”).
B. The 12-Month Period: As stated above, an eligible employee is entitled to a total
of twelve (12) workweeks of leave during any twelve (12) month period. That
twelve (12) month period is defined as a "rolling" twelve (12) month period
backward from the date an employee first uses any FMLA leave. In other words,
the number of weeks which an employee has available upon the beginning of a
FMLA leave shall be twelve (12) weeks less the number of FMLA leave weeks
taken in the twelve (12) month period immediately preceding the beginning of the
current FMLA leave (the "Available Leave Weeks").
1 “Worked” means the employee performed actual work. Worked does not include paid or unpaid
time off.
2 Accordingly, employees with less than one year of employment with the Town are not eligible for
FMLA leave.
Town of Londonderry Resolution 2019-05, Adopted 6/3/19
Title VI – Town Policy (Revised and Replaced Resolution 1997-13)
__________________________________________________________________________
In the case of leave taken to care for a covered service member with a serious injury
or illness, an employee who does not take all twenty-six (26) workweeks of leave to
care for the covered service member during the single 12-month period will forfeit
any remaining Military Caregiver Leave.
C. Leave for Birth, Adoption or Foster Care of a Child: A FMLA leave for the birth
or placement for adoption or foster care of a child must be taken all at once
unless otherwise agreed to by the Town Manager or his/her designee. Pursuant to
29 USC §2612(e), the employee must give thirty (30) days’ notice if the birth or
adoption is foreseeable or, if not foreseeable, such notice as is practicable.
D. Leave Due to a Serious Health Condition: A FMLA leave due to a ser ious heal th
condi t ion may be taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule. To qualify,
the employee or family member must have a serious health condition and the
intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule must be certified as medically necessary
by a health care provider. An employee who takes intermittent leave for planned
medical treatment has an obligation to make a reasonable effort to schedule
treatment so as not to unduly disrupt the operations of the employee’s department
and, if leave is for planned medical treatment, to give thirty (30) days’ notice or such
notice as is practicable. If FMLA leave is requested on an intermittent basis, the
Town Manager or his/her designee may require the employee to transfer
temporarily to an alternative position which better accommodates intermittent
periods of absence or a part-time schedule, provided that the position has
equivalent pay and benefits (but the position need not have equivalent duties).
E. Substitution of Accrued Paid Leave Required: The Town requires the substitution
of accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave time (i.e., any time during which the
Town does not process any payment to the employee through payroll, hereinafter
referred to as “Unpaid FMLA Leave”) as follows: Accrued sick (including “family
sick” time if applicable) leave, vacation leave (including personal time (if
applicable) and floating holiday(s) (if applicable)), in that order, will be substituted
for unpaid FMLA leave time. Upon the exhaustion of accrued paid leave, the
remainder of any FMLA leave will be unpaid. In no case will the combination of
paid and unpaid leave used for a FMLA purpose exceed twelve (12) workweeks
(twenty-six (26) workweeks for Military Caregiver Leave) in any twelve (12) month
period as defined herein.
Note: In the event an employee on FMLA leave is receiving wage replacement
through the Town’s Short-Term Disability Policy or through workers’
compensation, the employee is not required to use accrued time to make up the
difference between the wage replacement amount and the employee’s base wages;
however, the employee may elect to apply accrued time (in the order set forth above)
to make up the difference in pay and should consult with Human Resources with
regard to his/her pay options.
F. Designation of FMLA Leave: When an employee requests any leave of absence
which qualifies as leave under the FMLA, it is the Town’s responsibility and
right to designate such leave as FMLA leave. FMLA leave may be designated upon
Town of Londonderry Resolution 2019-05, Adopted 6/3/19
Title VI – Town Policy (Revised and Replaced Resolution 1997-13)
__________________________________________________________________________
request by the employee or when the Town has sufficient information concerning
the leave status of an employee to presume either that the employee or his/her
family member has a qualifying serious health condition as defined under the
FMLA, or that that the leave is due to the birth of the employee’s child or the
placement with the employee of a child for adoption or foster care. The Town’s
Human Resources Department personnel will request and obtain sufficient
information from the employee to determine whether the leave qualifies as FMLA
leave, to include a medical certification from the employee’s or family member’s
health care provider. In addition, the Town’s Human Resources Department
personnel or a physician authorized by the Town may contact the health care
provider for purposes of clarification and authentication of the medical certification
(whether initial certification or recertification) after the Town has given the
employee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies with the certification as set forth
in the FMLA regulations. Once the Town has determined the leave qualifies for
FMLA leave, the employee will be notified that the leave has been approved for
FMLA leave and will be counted towards the employee’s FMLA leave entitlement.
G. Leave for Purposes Not Covered Under FMLA: If an employee requests and is
granted authorized leave for a purpose that does not qualify as FMLA leave (e.g.,
leave to care for a parent-in-law, or a blood relative other than a spouse, child or
parent), that leave time will not be charged against the 12-week FMLA
entitlement. Thus, the amount of FMLA leave eligible to an employee who takes
two weeks of authorized vacation leave to care for a parent-in-law will not be
impacted by the vacation leave.
SECTION II STATUS OF INSURANCE BENEFITS WHILE ON FMLA LEAVE
A. While on FMLA leave, a n employee may continue to participate in the
Town's group health insurance in the same manner as employees not on FMLA
leave. Coverage for Life and Disability Insurance will continue for the duration of
the FMLA leave.
B. In the event of paid FMLA leave (during which the employee is either using
accrued leave time and/or receiving some form of wage replacement paid through
payroll), the employee’s share of any medical or dental insurance premiums will
continue to be deducted in the same manner as it would be when the employee is
not on FMLA leave.
• In the case of Unpaid FMLA Leave, an employee's share of any medical or
dental insurance premiums must be paid in advance by the employee on
the first day of each month.
C. Reinstatement: At the end of an authorized FMLA leave, an employee will be
reinstated to his or her previous job or to a position with equivalent pay, benefits
and substantially equivalent duties. However, there are some limits of
reinstatement. Employees returning from an FMLA leave have no greater rights to
Town of Londonderry Resolution 2019-05, Adopted 6/3/19
Title VI – Town Policy (Revised and Replaced Resolution 1997-13)
__________________________________________________________________________
reinstatement or other benefits and conditions of employment than if they had not
taken FMLA leave. For example, if an employee’s position was affected by a layoff
or reorganization or elimination, the employee may not be eligible for
reinstatement. An employee who fails to comply with the Town’s requirements for
reporting and fitness for duty certification may also be denied reinstatement.
SECTION III BASIC REGULATIONS AND CONDITIONS OF LEAVE
A. The Town will require medical certification to support a claim for FMLA leave
for an employee's own serious health condition or to care for the employee’s child,
spouse or parent with a serious health condition whenever that leave is
expected to extend beyond three (3) calendar days or will involve intermittent
or part-time leave. The employee shall have no more than fifteen (15)
calendar days to provide the medical certification to the Town.
1. For the employee's own medical leave, the certification must include a
statement that the employee is unable to perform an essential function of
his or her position.
2. For FMLA leave to care for a seriously ill child, spouse or parent, the
certification must include an estimate of the amount of time the employee
is needed to provide care.
B. The Town may require a second medical opinion and periodic recertification at
its own expense. If the first and second opinions differ, the Town, at its own
expense, may require the binding opinion of a third health care provider, approved
jointly by the Town and the employee.
SECTION IV NOTIFICATION AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
A. As set forth above, when the need for FMLA leave is foreseeable, such as the birth
or adoption of a child, or planned medical treatment, the employee must provide
reasonable prior notice, and make efforts to schedule leave so as not to disrupt
Town operations.
B. In cases of a FMLA leave due to a serious health condition, the employee will
be required to report periodically on his or her FMLA leave status and intention
to return to work.
C. At the expiration of any FMLA leave due to the employee's own serious health
condition, the employee must present medical certification of fitness for duty
before returning to work. The Town will require this certification to address
whether the employee can perform the essential functions of his/her
position.
Town of Londonderry Resolution 2019-05, Adopted 6/3/19
Title VI – Town Policy (Revised and Replaced Resolution 1997-13)
__________________________________________________________________________
SECTION V COORDINATION WITH MATERNITY LEAVE
A. The Town prov i d e s f ema l e emp l o y e e s wi t h a leave of absence for
the period of temporary physical disability resulting from pregnancy, childbirth
and related medical conditions (“Maternity Leave”). Although they may run
concurrently as set forth below, Maternity Leave is separate from FMLA leave. An
employee is eligible for Maternity Leave even if she has worked for the Town for
less than twelve (12) months or less than twelve hundred and fifty (1,250) hours in
the prior twelve (12) months. A Maternity Leave begins when an employee is
medically determined to be disabled and ends when the employee is medically
determined to be able to return to work, and is paid in accordance with the
provisions of the Town’s Short-Term Disability Policy. If an employee also is
eligible for FMLA leave, the employee’s FMLA leave and Maternity Leave will
run concurrently. Maternity Leave is not limited by any measure other than the
period of disability.
B. Once an employee has exhausted her paid Maternity Leave, she may take additional
FMLA leave to care for the child, assuming she has Available Leave Weeks
remaining. However, in no event shall the total FMLA leave for the birth of a child
(including the period of Maternity Leave) exceed 12-weeks total in the applicable
12-month period.
SECTION VI COORDINATION WITH OTHER TOWN POLICIES;
REFERENCE TO FMLA AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS
A. In the event of any conflict between this policy and other Town policies, the
provisions of this policy shall govern; however, if any provision of a Collective
Bargaining Agreement exceeds the benefits offered herein, the Collective
Bargaining Agreement shall control for those covered employees.
B. The FMLA and the FMLA federal regulations issued by the U.S. Department of
Labor (the “Federal Authorities”) contain many limitations and qualifications for
entitlement and governance of FMLA leave not stated herein.
C. Unless this Policy plainly states an intention to afford more generous benefits to
the employee than the Federal Authorities, the terms of the FMLA and the
FMLA federal regulations are incorporated herein and will be applied in all
instances of requested or designated FMLA leave. If there is an ambiguity in this
Policy, the ambiguity shall be resolved in favor of the construction most consistent
with the Federal Authorities.

CHAPTER XVII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
SECTION VICAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS FUND
A. The Town has established Capital Reserve Funds under the provisions of
RSA 35:1 for the purpose of funding one or more of the items set forth in
the Capital Improvements Program, and to raise and appropriate a sum
equal to the eventual replacement or leasing costs of equipment identified
in each department’s acquisition schedule.
B. The Town will target the expenditure of unassigned fund balance, in excess
of those funds retained pursuant to Section XI-D2 of this policy, to fund
capital improvements not designated for long-term bonding.

CHAPTER XVII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
SECTION VII EXPENDABLE MAINTENANCE TRUST FUND (Cont’d)
The plan will assist the Town Manager in proposing the amount for a
warrant article appropriating funds to the Town’s Expendable
Maintenance Trust Fund.
SECTION VIII FIXED ASSETS
A. GASB 34 requires municipalities to capitalize and annually depreciate
fixed assets. The following defines the categories of fixed assets the town
needs to maintain financial records on an ongoing basis:
1. General Fixed Assets of the municipality, which includes items
such as land, buildings, building improvements, equipment,
vehicles, furnishings and computer equipment.
2. Enterprise Fund Fixed Assets of the municipality, which include
normal fixed assets as stated above, and infrastructure (i.e., sewer
lines) of the municipality’s enterprise fund operations.
3. Infrastructure Fixed Assets of the municipality, which include
roads and bridges.
B. The threshold the Town is maintaining general fixed assets at is
$10,000.00. All departments of the Town shall notify the Finance
Department upon acquisition or disposition of any general fixed asset for
proper and accurate reporting on Town financial statements.
SECTION IX PROPERTY TAX RATE
A. It is the Town’s goal that the annual property tax rate, while subject to
change based on the Town’s need to maintain the desired level of costeffective
services, will be managed to avoid significant annual
fluctuations.
B. Increased service levels may warrant an increase in the property tax rate,
while other factors may warrant a decrease in the rate. In addition, trends
in Federal and State government may require that the revenues received
from property taxes, and thus the tax rate, be adjusted annually. These
trends include:
1. Decreases in other revenue sources; including motor vehicles
permit fees, investments, and State and Federal Revenues
2. General Inflation, which increases the costs of municipal services
3. Mandates by the State and Federal governments, which increase
the cost of municipal services or impose new services.

CHAPTER XVII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
SECTION IX PROPERTY TAX RATE (Cont’d)
4. Changing demographics within the community may warrant
revisions to the Town’s current municipal services.
C. Factors which may warrant a decrease in the property tax rate include:
1. Any other source of new, recurring revenue
2. A reduced cost for providing current services
3. Significant non residential additions to the Town’s tax base
SECTION X DEBT MANAGEMENT
A. The Town will consider the use of debt financing only for one-time capital
improvement projects and unusual equipment purchases, only under the
following circumstances:
1. When the project’s useful life or the projected service life of the
equipment will exceed the term of the financing.
2. When there are designated revenues sufficient to service the debt,
whether from project revenues, other specified and reserved
resources, or infrastructure cost-sharing revenues
3. Debt financing is not considered appropriate for any recurring
purpose such as current operating and maintenance expenditures.
B. The Town will use the following criteria to evaluate pay-as-you-go
versus long-term debt financing in funding capital improvements:
1. Factors which favor pay-as-you-go:
a. Current revenues and adequate fund balances are available
b. Project phasing is feasible
c. Debt levels would adversely affect the Town’s credit rating
d. Market conditions are unstable or present difficulties in
marketing bonds
2. Factors which favor long-term financing:
a. Revenues available for debt service are considered
sufficient and reliable so that long-term financings can be
marketed with the highest possible credit rating.
b. The project for which financing is being considered is of
the type which will allow the Town to maintain or improve
its current credit rating.

CHAPTER XVII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
SECTION X DEBT MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)
c. Market conditions present favorable interest rates and
demand for municipal financing
d. A project is mandated by State or Federal requirements and
current revenues and funds balances are insufficient to pay
project costs
e. A project is immediately required to meet or relieve
capacity needs
f. The life of the project or asset financed is ten years (10) or
longer
g. A project’s long term benefits require that costs be shared
by current and future users and outweigh the additional
costs as measured on a present value basis.
C. General obligation debt may be used in lieu of revenue debt if expenses
can be significantly reduced (as compared to financing from selfsupporting
revenues) and if special or enterprise fund revenue available
for debt service is considered sufficient and reliable.
D. General obligation (bonded) debt will not exceed the statutory limits
imposed by NHRSA Chapter 33 – Municipal Finance Act.
E. An analysis will be prepared by Town staff for each long-term financing.
The analysis will assess the impact of debt issuance on current and future
operating and capital budgets and address the reliability of revenues to
support debt service payments.
F. The Town will generally conduct financing on a competitive basis;
however, negotiated financing or low interest programs, such as the NH
DES Revolving Grant Program, may be used where the use of an unusual
or complex financing or security structure is a concern with regard to
marketability, or it is more cost effective to negotiate with a sole source.
G. The Town will seek to maintain or improve its current bond rating and
will specifically discuss with the Town Council any proposal that may
cause that rating to be lowered.
H. The Town will seek credit enhancements such as letters of credit or
insurance when necessary for marketing purposes or cost effectiveness.
I. The Town will monitor all forms of debt annually. An analysis will be
included in the Town’s Financial Plan. Concerns and recommended
remedies will be reported to the Council as necessary.

SECTION X DEBT MANAGEMENT (Cont’d)
J. The Town will monitor compliance with bond covenants and adhere to
Federal arbitrage regulations.
K. The Town will follow a policy of full disclosure on every financial report
and bond prospectus voluntarily following disclosure guidelines provided
by the Government Finance Officers’ Association (GFOA), unless the cost
of compliance with the higher standard is unreasonable.
L. Inter-fund borrowing and internal lending will be considered to finance
high priority needs on a case-by-case basis, only when other planned
expenditures in the fund making the loan would not be affected. Lending
may be used when it would reduce the cost of interest, debt issuance,
and/or administration, or encourage private investment that might
otherwise not take place. Any inter-fund borrowing shall be accompanied
by a plan of repayment to the affected fund.
SECTION XI POST-ISSUE TAX COMPLIANCE POLICY AND PROCEDURES
FOR TAX-EXEMPT OBLIGATIONS
The purpose of this Post-Issuance Tax Compliance Policy and Procedures is to establish

c) issue) and a separate Cost of Issuance Fund as necessary to allocate
proceeds to Bond issuance costs into which the proceeds of the issue shall
be deposited, as applicable;
d) review all requisitions, draw schedules, draw requests, invoices and bills
requesting payment from the Project Fund;

date the project/asset was placed in service (but not more than 3 years
after the original expenditures were paid) except with respect to those
expenditures for which the Issuer obtained a certificate of licensed
engineer/architect to the effect that (I) at least five (5) years was necessary
to complete the construction of the part of the project for which such
expenditures were required; and (II) such expenditures shall be reimbursed
not more than five (5) years after the date that the original expenditures

4. Arbitrage/Rebate Compliance and Timely Expenditure of Proceeds. The
Coordinator shall review the No Arbitrage and Tax Certificate (or equivalent) (the
“Certificate”) for each tax-exempt obligation issued by the Issuer and the expenditure
records provided in Section 2 of this policy, above, and shall ensure that the Issuer takes
the following actions:
a) monitor and ensure that proceeds of each such issue are spent within
the temporary period set forth in the Certificate;
b) if at the time of issuance, it appears that that the Bonds will qualify for the
small issuer exception to the rebate requirement, the Coordinator will
monitor the amount of subsequent tax-exempt obligations issued or
proposed to be issued in the calendar year in which the Bonds closed to
ensure that the Issuer does not exceed the $5 million or $15 million
threshold, as applicable, in such calendar year;
c) if at the time of issuance, based on reasonable expectations set forth in the
Certificate, it appears likely that the issue will qualify for an exemption
from the rebate requirement, the Issuer may defer taking any of the actions
set forth in subsection (c) below. Not later than the time of completion of
construction or acquisition of the project, and depletion of all funds from
the Project Fund, the Issuer shall make a determination if the expenditure
of the Bond proceeds qualified for an exemption from the rebate
requirements based on spending within a 6 month, 18 month or 2 year
period after issuance. If a rebate exemption is determined to be applicable,
the Issuer shall prepare and keep in the permanent records of the issue a
memorandum evidencing this conclusion together with records of
expenditure to support such conclusion. If the transaction does not qualify
for rebate exemption, the Issuer shall initiate the steps set forth in (d)
below;
d) if at the time of issuance it appears likely that arbitrage rebate calculations
will be required, or upon determination that calculations are required
pursuant to (c) above, the Issuer shall:
i. engage the services of expert advisors (each a “Rebate Service
Provider”) to assist in the calculation of arbitrage rebate payable in
respect of the investment of Bond proceeds, or else shall ensure
that it has adequate financial, accounting and legal resources of its
own to make such calculations, and, prior to each rebate
calculation date, cause the trustee or other financial institution
investing bond proceeds to deliver periodic statements concerning

the investment of Bond proceeds to the Rebate Service Provider;
ii. provide to the Rebate Service Provider additional documents and
information reasonably requested by the Rebate Service Provider;
iii. monitor efforts of the Rebate Service Provider;
iv. assure payment of required rebate amounts, if any, no later than 60
days after each 5-year anniversary of the issue date of the Bonds,
and no later than 60 days after the last Bond of each issue is
redeemed;
v. during the construction period of each capital project financed in
whole or in part by Bonds, monitor the investment and expenditure
of Bond proceeds and consult with the Rebate Service Provider to
determine compliance with any applicable exceptions from the
arbitrage rebate requirements during each 6-month spending period
up to 6 months, 18 months or 2 years, as applicable, following the
issue date of the Bonds;
vi. retain copies of all arbitrage reports, trustee statements and other
documents as required herein; and
vii. in lieu of engaging an outside Rebate Service Provider, the Issuer
may make a determination that it has sufficient capabilities using its
own personnel, supported by its regular accounting and legal
advisers, to be able to make the required rebate calculations. Such
determination shall be evidenced in writing with specific reference
to the personnel and advisers to carry out the calculations, and such
written determination shall be maintained in the records of the bond
transaction.
5. Proper Use of Bond Financed Assets.
a) The Coordinator shall maintain appropriate records and a list of all bond
financed assets. Such records shall include the actual amount of proceeds
(including investment earnings) spent on each of the bond financed assets.
b) With respect to each bond-financed asset, the Coordinator will monitor
and confer with bond counsel with respect to all proposed:
i. management contracts,

CHAPTER XVII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)

FOR TAX-EXEMPT OBLIGATIONS (Cont’d)
ii. service agreements,
iii. research contracts,
iv. naming rights contracts,
v. leases or sub-leases,
vi. joint venture, limited liability or partnership arrangements,
vii. sale of property, or
viii. any other change in use of such asset.
c) Section 141 of the Code sets forth private activity tests for the purpose of
limiting the volume of tax-exempt bonds that finance activities of persons
other than state and local governmental entities. These tests serve to
identify arrangements that actually or reasonably expect to transfer the
benefits of tax-exempt financing to non-governmental persons, including
the federal government. The Coordinator shall provide to the users of any
bond-financed property a copy of this Compliance Policy and other
appropriate written guidance advising that:
i. “Private business use” means use by any person other than the
Issuer, including business corporations, partnerships, limited
liability companies, associations, non-profit corporations, natural
persons engaged in trade or business activity, and the United States
of America and any federal agency, as a result of ownership of the
property or use of the property under a lease, management or
service contract (except for certain “qualified” management or
service contracts), “naming rights” contract, “public-private
partnership” arrangement, or any similar use arrangement that
provides special legal entitlements for the use of the bond financed
property;
ii. No more that 10% of the proceeds of any tax-exempt bond issue
(including the property financed with the Bonds) may be used for
private business use, of which no more than 5% of the proceeds of
the tax-exempt bond issue (including the property financed with
the bonds) may be used for any “unrelated” private business use –
that is, generally, a private business use that is not functionally
related to the government’s purposes of the Bonds; and no more
that the lesser of $5,000,000 or 5% of the proceeds of a tax-exempt
bond issue may be used to make or finance a loan to any person
other than a state or local government unit;
iii. Before entering into any special use arrangement with a nongovernmental
person that involves the use of bond financed

FOR TAX-EXEMPT OBLIGATIONS (Cont’d)
property, the Coordinator will consult with bond counsel, provide
bond counsel with a description of the proposed non-governmental
use arrangement, and determine whether that use arrangement, if
put into effect, will be consistent with the restrictions on private
business use of the bond financed property; and
iv. In connection with the evaluation of any proposed nongovernmental
use arrangement, the Issuer will consult with bond
counsel to obtain federal tax advice in whether that use
arrangement, if put into effect, will be consistent with the
restrictions on private business use of the bond financed property,
and, if not, whether any “remedial action” permitted under §141 of
the Code may be taken as means of enabling that use arrangement
to be put into effect without adversely affecting the tax-exempt
status of the Bonds.
d) The Coordinator shall maintain a copy of any such proposed agreement,
contract, lease or arrangement, together with the response by bond counsel
with respect to said proposal for at least three (3) years after retirement of
all tax-exempt obligations issued to fund all or any portion of bond
financed assets;
e) The Coordinator shall consult with bond counsel and other legal counsel
and advisers in the review of any change in use of bond-financed or
refinanced assets to ensure compliance with all covenants and restrictions
set forth in the Certificate;
f) The Coordinator shall confer at least annually with other personnel
responsible for bond-financed or refinanced assets to identify and discuss
any existing or planned use of bond-financed or refinanced assets, to
ensure that those uses are consistent with all covenants and restrictions set
forth in the Certificate; and

million or less and designated by the Issuer as “bank qualified” under Section 265(b)(3)
of the Code, the Coordinator will monitor the amount of subsequent tax-exempt
obligations issued or proposed to be issued in the calendar year in which the Bonds
closed to ensure that the Issuer does not exceed the $10 million threshold in such
calendar year.
7. General Project Records. For each project financed with tax-exempt
obligations, the Coordinator shall maintain a copy of all material documents relating to
capital expenditures financed or re-financed by tax-exempt proceeds, until three (3)

d) redemption date of the refunded bonds; (iii) that the proposed issuance
complies with federal income tax requirements which allow for the
proceeds and replacement proceeds of an issue to be invested temporarily
in higher yielding investments without causing the advance refunding
bonds to become “arbitrage bonds”; (iv) that the proposed issuance will
not result in the issuer’s exploitation of the difference between tax exempt
and taxable interest rates to obtain an financial advantage nor overburden
the tax exempt market in a way that might be considered an abusive
transaction for federal tax purposes; and (v) that the proposed refunding
complies with applicable State law.
e) The Coordinator shall collect and review data related to arbitrage
yield restriction and rebate requirements for advance refunding
bonds. To ensure such compliance, the Coordinator shall engage a

the advance refunding issuance. Said report shall ensure said
requirements are satisfied.
e) The Coordinator shall, whenever possible, purchase SLGS to size each
advance refunding escrow. The financial advisor and/or bond counsel
shall be included in the process of subscribing SLGS. To the extent
SLGS are not available for purchase, the Coordinator shall, in
consultation with bond counsel and the financial advisor, comply with
IRS regulations.
f) To the extent the Issuer elects to purchase a guaranteed investment
contract, the Coordinator shall ensure, after input from bond counsel,
compliance with any bidding requirements set forth by the IRS
regulations.

the Coordinator shall obtain and retain issue price certification by
the purchasing underwriter at closing.
h) After the issuance of an advance refunding issue, the Coordinator shall
ensure timely identification of violations of any federal tax requirements
and engage bond counsel in attempt to remediate same in accordance
with IRS regulations.
9. Continuing Disclosure. The Coordinator shall assure compliance with
each continuing disclosure certificate and annually, per continuing disclosure
agreements, file audited annual financial statements and other information required by

agreement relating to any such actions, other than pursuant to its terms, if
material; and
o) Appointment of a successor or additional trustee or the change of name of

notice and updates of documents to EMMA, the Electronic Municipal Market Access
website managed by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. Compliance is
required in accordance with the Issuer’s Material Events Disclosure Certificate and/or
Continuing Disclosure Certificate executed in connection with a bond or note issue.
11. Due Diligence and Remedial Actions. In all activities related to the
Issuer’s Bonds, the Coordinator and his/her staff will exercise due diligence to comply
with the Code provisions governing tax-exempt obligations. The Issuer is aware of (a) the
Voluntary Closing Agreement Program (known as “VCAP”) operated by the IRS which
allows issuers to voluntarily enter into a closing agreement in the event of certain noncompliance
with Federal tax requirements and (b) the remedial actions available under
Section 1.141-12 of the Income Tax Regulations for private use of bond financed
property which was not expected at the time the Bonds were issued.
12. Periodic Review. The Issuer will monitor compliance with the guidelines
contained in this policy as well as any other covenants not specifically included herein
and will review and update these guidelines at least annually and whenever necessary due
to change in law or circumstances.

SECTION XII BUDGET GUIDELINES (Cont’d)
4. Revenues generated from programs or reserves should be taken into
account when evaluating the cost effectiveness of the program or service,
if the revenues would not be received without those programs or services.
For example, a service might be deemed cost effective if part of the related
costs were offset by user fees, but not cost effective if the Town were to
fund the program fully from the General Fund without user fees.
C. Supplemental Appropriations (Incorporated from Title I, Chptr. VI, Section VI)
No appropriations shall be made for any purpose not included in the annual
budget as adopted, unless to apply for, accept and expend funds in accordance
with RSA 31:95-b, Capital Reserve Funds, or other Trust Funds where the
Town Council has been designated as agents to expend.
D. To provide for emergencies, working cash and as a safeguard against fluctuating

shall be considered along with the balance of the fiscal year budget
proposal.
E. Special Revenue Funds should be established where revenues from a specific
source shall be used for specific purposes; the purpose is not funded through the
property tax, and/or difficulty is encountered accurately predicting the annual
level of activity. Special Revenue Funds require the approval of Town Meeting
pursuant to RSA 31:95-d.
F. Fees should be reviewed on a regular basis to maintain cost recovery rates
existent when the fees were established. Modifications to cost recovery rates or
new fees should be considered where appropriate. In general, user fees are
applicable when services are not basic or when specific beneficiaries and their
relative level of benefit can be identified.
G. Grant revenues shall be pursued to provide or enhance Town services. However,
recurring activities shall be initiated with grant funds only if one of the following
conditions is met:
1. The activity can be terminated in the event that the grant revenues are
discontinued; or,
2. The activity should and can be assumed within recurring Town funds in
the event the grant revenues are discontinued.
H. The proposed budget for the General Fund will be limited as follows:
1. Expenditures for personnel services (salaries and benefits) may be increased in
accordance with approved labor contracts. For non-bargaining unit employees, increases will be
approved in accordance with the Town’s Personnel and Compensation Policy for Non-

2. Expenditures for items other than salaries and benefits will be increased or decreased
based on the guidance issued to the Town Manager by the Town Council
as outlined above.
SECTION XIII USER FEES
A. User Fees are appropriate when services are not “basic” or when specific
beneficiaries and their relative level of benefit can be identified. “Basic services”
are those which the Town wishes to provide to all citizens. An individual may not
forego these services because of the potential impact on public health, safety, or
welfare.
B. A service which provides benefit to the entire community and for which the
benefit to specific users cannot be measured, or the cost of measuring the benefit
to specific users would be prohibitive (e.g.: street maintenance) should be funded
from the General Fund.
C. A regular schedule of review will be established for all user fees.
D. Types of services which may be funded by User Fees:
1. A service which provides benefits to a limited group, but provides little or no
general benefit to the community, (e.g.: document reproduction), which shall be
provided based upon cost recovery, (all direct and indirect costs) or on a rate
structure (flat rate per unit of service).
2. A service which provides potential benefit to all members of the community
and the benefit to each user can be measured or fairly approximated (e.g.: sewer
maintenance, building permits, most licenses and permits except those used by a
targeted group), shall be provided upon cost recovery (all direct costs), or on a
rate structure (based upon level of service) or flat rate for licenses and permits.
3. Definitions:
a.“Direct costs” include all costs of performing the service, regulating the
activity being licensed and collecting the fee, including staff time
and benefits
b.“Indirect costs” include a proportionate share of budgeted expenditures for administrative
services, and overhead costs such as insurance and building maintenance.

CHAPTER VII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
SECTION XIII USER FEES (Cont’d)
E. For any proposed fee, staff will provide an assessment of the socio-economic
impact of the fee upon users. The Town Council may choose not to charge a fee
if it would prevent low or fixed income groups from using Town services.
F. Council may opt not to charge a fee if it would be in conflict with accomplishing
public policy objectives (e.g.: fire inspections)
G. If the cost of administering and collecting a fee is disproportionately high in
relation to the cost of providing the service, the service may be funded from the
General Fund.
H. In recommending an appropriate rate, staff will consider similar fees charged by
other jurisdictions in close proximity and of similar size, with similar operations.
Where the Town service is in direct competition with the private sector (i.e.:
parking), the Town’s fees should be competitive unless there is a specific purpose
achieved by leading or following market rates.
I. Citizen Participation - Pursuant to RSA 41:9-a, a public hearing will be held
before any new fee is instituted or an existing fee is amended.
J. Current services funded from new user fees - When any fee is instituted to fund
services currently funded from the General Fund, the Town will consider whether
general revenues should be reduced accordingly, or whether those revenues
should be targeted to some identified purpose.
SECTION XIV POTENTIAL REVENUE SOURCES
A. For any proposed additional revenue source, the Town Council will
consider the following criteria:
1. Community acceptability
2. Competitiveness, the revenue or tax burden of Londonderry relative to
neighboring, or similarly sized, communities
3. Diversity, the balance of revenue sources that can withstand changes in the
business cycle
4. Efficiency, the cost of administering a fee should bear a reasonable
relation to revenues collected, and any new fee should have minimal
effects on private economic decisions
5. Fairness, the distribution of the Town’s revenue burden as measured by ability to pay, the
benefits received, or the community’s definition of the resident’s fair share of the revenue
burden.

SECTION XV INVESTMENT POLICY (formerly Investment Policy, Title I Gen.Code)
A. Purpose - This investment policy applies to all financial assets of the Town of
Londonderry, except those transferred to the Trustees of the Trust Funds. These
funds are accounted for in the Town’s annual financial report and include:
B.
1. General Fund
2. Sewer Fund
3. Capital Project Fund
4. Special Revenue Funds
5. Any new fund created by Town Meeting or Town Council, unless
specifically exempted by the articles of its creation
C. This investment policy applies to all transactions involving the financial assets
and related activity of all the foregoing funds.
D. The investing officers authorized by this policy to invest financial assets for the
Town of Londonderry are defined as the Town Treasurer and the Finance Officer.
E. Objectives:
1. Safety of Principal is the foremost objective of the Town. Each
investment transaction shall seek to first ensure that capital losses are
avoided, whether they be from securities defaults or erosion of market
value
2 The Town Council seeks to attain market rates of return on its
investments, consistent with constraints imposed by its safety objectives,
cash flow considerations, and State laws that restrict the placement of
public funds. The Town’s Finance Director is encouraged to represent the
Council’s best interests in seeking to remove constraints to the efficient
investment of its funds.
3. All participants in the investment process shall seek to act responsibly as
custodians of the public trust. They shall avoid any transaction that might
impair public confidence in the Town Council’s ability to govern
effectively.

CHAPTER VII – FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
SECTION XV INVESTMENT POLICY (Cont’d)
4 The determination of the best appropriate types and mixtures of
investments is dependent upon several factors; the primary objective is
safety. Once that objective is obtained, the optimum return on the
investment should be consistent with the goals of the cash management
program of the Town. The factors that should be taken into account
include:
a. Safety - Safety is achieved through adherence to the list of
permitted investments which are backed by the full faith and credit
of, or a guarantee of principal and interest by, the U.S.
Government.
b. Liquidity - All investments must be capable of being liquidated on
a one day notice. Therefore, no investment may be made which
imposes a longer notice period for redemption or which are not
readily marketable.
c. Yield - The Town should strive to achieve the highest yield
consistent with the other factors of the Investment Policy.
d. Maturity - Investments should be scheduled to mature when funds are needed. Sale of
securities prior to maturity should be avoided due to the inherent
risk. Investments shall be limited to securities maturing in periods
up to one year, or lesser period, that coincides with expected
disbursements by the Town.
e. Amount - the best or most appropriate type of investment depends
to some degree upon the amount available for investment, as
certain investments require a large initial investment amount.
f. Administrative Cost - In choosing an investment, the Town must consider the
administrative work involved, particularly with regard to
investments of short duration. Substantial amounts can be invested
for periods as short as one or two days. However, the
administrative costs with small amounts may be greater than the
return on investments, thus, would not be justified as cost
effective. Administrative costs will be higher with more frequent
turnover of investments and must be taken into account together
with the yield and term in determining the optimum investment
strategy.

interest in the awarding of business and contracts with the Town, no person serving as a
Town Councilor or Town Manager shall take part at any stage in any negotiations, or vote

TOWN OF LONDONDERRY Adopted 01-21-08, Revised – Ordinance 2008-10,
Title VI – Town Policy Ordinance 2014-04 – 09/08/14

SECTION III CODE PROVISIONS (cont’d.)
B. A Duty to Recuse in Quasi-Judicial Actions
A "quasi-judicial action" is any action where the board or committee you are a member of
is acting like a judge or a jury. For example, when your board or committee has a duty to
notify the potential parties, hear the parties, and can only decide on the matter after
weighing and considering such evidence and arguments as the parties choose to lay before
you, you are involved in a quasi-judicial action. The work of the planning and zoning
boards is largely quasi-judicial. Community Officials are expected to recuse themselves
if a conflict exists or if they believe they cannot for any reason be totally fair and
impartial. 1,9
C. A Duty to Disclose
As a Community Official, you shall make full disclosure and not participate in the
conduct of business on behalf of the town or enter into discussion or deliberation of any
matter if you have a financial interest, direct or indirect, in any planned or existing
contract, job, work or service to be performed for the Town or voluntary sale to the Town
of any land, materials, supplies, equipment or other property.14
D. No Unfair Personal Use of Town Property
No Community Official shall use town property, services, or labor personally, or make
the same available to others unless such use is available to other residents upon request
on equal terms. 3,7,8
E. No Misuse of Confidential Information
No Community Official shall use any confidential information acquired by virtue of that
individual’s official position for personal benefit, or for the benefit of any other person or
business. This does not apply to information which is readily available to the general
public. 4,8,10

SECTION III CODE PROVISIONS (cont’d.)
F. No Improper Gifts
No Community Official shall accept a gift (or allow acceptance of such gift by a family
member) from any individual, group, or corporation which has or is likely to have a
matter pending before the employee, board, committee, or commission on which the
Community Official serves. (This provision of the code is not meant to apply to gifts
traditionally exchanged between family members, or for those gifts normally exchanged
during the holiday season with a value of less than $25.00.) 5,8,9
G. A Duty to Cooperate
All Community Officials shall cooperate with the Appointing Authority regarding any
complaint or inquiry alleging violation of this Code of Ethics.
SECTION IV REPORTING PROCESS

Ordinance may report the alleged violation to the Community Official’s Appointing
Authority using the attached form. The Appointing Authority is:
A. For all employees, the Town Manager 13
B. For the Town Manager, the Town Council 13
C. For all appointed board, committee and commission members, the Town
Council 12
D. For a member of an Elected Body, the Elected Body on which the member
serves. An elected body, other than the Town Council15, has no
disciplinary authority over the actions of its individual members. Citizens,
however may utilize Section 7.6 of the Town Charter, Recall of
Officeholders. 6
The Appointing Authority shall investigate alleged violations and act as appropriate

SECTION V DISTRIBUTION
This Ordinance shall be made available to all Community Officials upon their submittal
of a letter of interest to serve the community or filing for elective office. Upon election or
appointment, the Community Official shall then sign a form acknowledging receipt of
same. At least annually, the Town Council shall schedule sessions with Community

A. Any Community Official who is a resident of the Town of Londonderry

campaign, provided such contributions are reported in accordance with all state

08)
Employees and volunteers under the direction of the Leach Library Board of Library
Trustees, and Community Officials elected, hired or appointed by the Londonderry
School District, School Board and/or Superintendent are not subject to the provisions
of this code.
This Code is adopted pursuant to RSA 31:39-a; which requires that affected officers and
employees shall be exempt from the provisions of this Ordinance. The exemption shall be for
a period no less than one year. As all of this Code’s provisions are rooted in current state
statutes or current local ordinance, this provision does not allow community officials to rely
upon the exemption and disregard the underlying regulation.
