AN ORDINANCE TO APPROVE, ADOPT AND ENACT THE CODIFIED ORDINANCES; TO REPEAL
ORDINANCES IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND
DECLARING AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, the Council of the Village of Ottawa, Ohio, has had the matter of
codification and general revision of the ordinances before it for some time,
and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with the Walter H. Drane
Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such ordinances, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed are before
the Council.
   BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF OTTAWA, OHIO:
SECTION 1: That the ordinances of the Village of Ottawa, Ohio, of a general and
permanent nature, as revised, codified, rearranged and consolidated into
component codes, titles, chapters and sections are hereby approved, adopted and
enacted as the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Ottawa, Ohio, 1985.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this Ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent records of the Village of Ottawa, Ohio.
SECTION 2: That the provisions of this Ordinance, including all provisions of
the Codified Ordinances, shall be in full force and effect as provided in
Section 5 of this Ordinance. All ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof
enacted prior to which are inconsistent with any provision of the Codified
Ordinances, are hereby repealed as of the effective date of this Ordinance
except as follows:
   (a)    The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative
provisions prior to the effective date of such enactment, or any action or
proceeding for the enforcement of such right or liability. Such enactment shall
not be construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
the violation of any such legislative provisions, nor to affect an indictment
or prosecution therefor. For such purposes, any such legislative provision
shall continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of
revision and codification.
   (b)    The repeal provided above shall not affect:
      (1)    The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement or
privilege.
      (2)    The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property.
      (3)    The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or guarantee
of payment.
      (4)    The assumption of any contract or obligation.
      (5)    The issuance and delivery of any bonds, obligations or other
instruments of indebtedness.
      (6)    The levy or imposition of taxes, assessments or charges.
      (7)    The establishment, naming, vacating or grade level of any street
or public way.
      (8)    The dedication of property or plat approval.
      (9)    The annexation or detachment of territory.
      (10)    Any legislation enacted subsequent to December 17, 1984.
SECTION 3: That all legislation enacted subsequent to December 17, 1984, which
amended, replaced or otherwise affected a material provision of those
ordinances existing prior to December 17, 1984 shall be deemed to amend,
replace or affect the analogous or comparable section of the Codified
Ordinances as reflected in the Comparative Section Table of the same, or as
otherwise indicated by the content or purpose of such subsequent legislation.
SECTION 4: That this Ordinance is hereby declared to be an emergency measure
necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health, safety
and welfare of the residents of the Village, the reason for the necessity being
that there exists an imperative need for the earliest publication and
distribution of the Codified Ordinances to the officials and residents of the
Village, so as to facilitate administration and daily operation and avoid
practical and legal entanglements.
SECTION 5: That this Ordinance shall become effective at the earliest date
allowed by law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
     The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
     This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in
allowing for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
     Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained
in the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either
its passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that
time, or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories
indicate that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the
Adopting Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
     The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

Charter does not enumerate specific procedures with respect to any subject
matter (including but not limited to civil service, personnel, contracting, and

ordinances, resolutions, or administrative regulations of the Municipality, or
the actions of the officers or employees of the municipality.
SECTION 2.03 Construction

   101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
   101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
   101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
   101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
   101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   (bb)   "Village" means the Village of Ottawa, Putnam County, Ohio.
      (Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)    Subject to the provisions of Section
191.06, an annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
191.01 shall be imposed at the rate of one percent (1.00%) per year upon the
following:
      (1)   On all income, defined in Section
191.02, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation earned and/or
received by residents of the Village. 
      (2)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received by nonresidents for work done or services performed or
rendered in the Village.  This includes separation pay, termination pay,
reduction-in-force pay, and other compensation paid as a result of an employee
leaving the service of an employer located in the Village.
         A.   The Village shall not, however, tax the compensation of a non-
resident individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant if all of
the following apply:
            1.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by
the individual in the Village on twelve or fewer days during the calendar year,
in which case the individual shall be considered an occasional entrant for
purposes of the Village income tax.  A day is a full day or any fractional part
of a day.
            2.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the principal
place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the Village
and the individual pays tax on compensation described in Section
191.03(a)(2) to the municipality, if any, in which the employer's principal
place of business is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the
individual.
            3.   The individual is not a professional entertainer or
professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports
event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by
the Village.
         B.   Beginning with the thirteenth day, if an individual deemed to
have been an occasional entrant to the Village performs services within the
Village, the employer of said individual shall begin withholding the Village
income tax from remuneration paid by the employer to the individual, and shall
remit the withheld income tax to the Village in accordance with the
requirements of this chapter.  Since the individual can no longer be considered
to have been an occasional entrant, the employer is further required to remit
taxes on income earned in the Village by the individual for the first twelve
days.
         C.   If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
Village.
      (3)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned of all resident unincorporated businesses, professions, associations or
other activities, derived from work done or services performed or rendered and
business or other activities conducted in the Village.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received by a resident partner and/or owner of a resident
unincorporated business entity, including associations, not attributable to the
Village, and not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
      (4)   A.   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits
earned by all nonresident unincorporated businesses, professions, associations
or other activities, derived from work done or services performed or rendered
and business or other activities conducted in the Village, whether or not such
unincorporated business entity has an office or place of business in the
Village.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received by a resident partner and/or owner of a nonresident
unincorporated business entity, including associations, not attributable to the
Village and not levied against such unincorporated business entity.
      (5)   On the portion attributable to the Village of the net profits of
all corporations derived from work done or services performed or rendered and
business or other activities conducted in the Village, whether or not such
corporations have an office or place of business in the Village.
      (6)   Effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable only to the extent
of the portion, if any, that represents wages, or net earnings from self-
employment.
   (b)   Rentals from Real Property.
      (1)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included in the
computation of net profit from business activities only if, and to the extent
that, the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate from
which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by the
taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives) constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)   Where the gross monthly rental of any real properties, regardless
of number and value, aggregate in excess of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)
in this Village, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental, ownership,
management or operation of such properties is a business activity of such
taxpayer and the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to tax;
provided that in the case of commercial property, the owners shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of
the lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds the rental rate of this Village;
provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm, whether or not the gross income exceeds the rental rate of this
Village; and provided further that the person who operates a licensed rooming
house shall be considered in business whether or not the gross income exceeds
the rental rate of this Village. 
      (3)   Rental income received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying or selling real estate shall always be considered as part of business
income.
      (4)   Owners of rental property who are non-residents of this Village,
whether individuals or business entities, are subject to tax only on other
income from real property located in this Village.  In determining whether
gross monthly rentals exceed the rental rate of this Village, only the income
from such properties located within this Village shall be considered.  Net
losses may be offset against net profits only between rental properties located
in this Village.
      (5)   Owners of rental property who are residents of this Village are
subject to tax on the net income from rentals (to the extent above specified),
regardless of the location of the real property owned, excepting that if any
such property is located and subject to a municipal income tax by another
taxing municipality, credit shall be claimed in accordance with Section
191.14.
      (6)   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only on the
portion of income derived from property located in this Village. 
      (7)   Reporting of tenant occupancies shall be prepared in accordance
with the provisions in Section
191.15.
   (c)   Determination of Allocation of Tax (Method of Determination).
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the Village for purposes of municipal income taxation in the same
proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of the
real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.  As used in
this section, real property shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to persons employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their
services are performed.  For tax year 2004 and subsequent tax years, wages,
salaries, and other compensation shall be included to the extent they represent
qualifying wages.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula in Section
191.03(b)(1) does not produce an equitable result, another basis (including the
books and records method) may, under uniform regulations of the Village, be
substituted so as to produce such result.
      (3)   As used in subsection (b)(1) hereof, "sales made in the Village"
means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the Village;
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Village if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through its own
employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Village and the
sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village to purchasers outside the Village regardless of where
title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
   (d)   The following provisions apply with respect to the carry forward of
net operating losses:
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer in any
taxable year, attributable to the Village, may be applied against the portion
of the net profits of the taxpayer attributable to the Village in succeeding
taxable years until exhausted, but in no event for more than five (5) taxable
years immediately following the taxable year in which the loss occurred.  No
portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer shall be carried back
against net profits of any prior taxable year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer for any
taxable year attributable to the Village shall be determined in the same manner
as provided herein for determining net profits attributable to the Village.
   (e)    Exemptions. The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon the
following:
      (1)    Military pay or allowances of members of the armed forces of the
United States and of members of their reserve components, including the
National Guard.
      (2)    Social security benefits, unemployment compensation (excluding
supplemental unemployment compensation), payments from pension plans,

the beneficiary of an employee under a retirement program or plan (whether
qualified or nonqualified), disability payments received from private industry,
or local, state, or federal governments, or from charitable, religious or
educational organizations to the extent they are not taxable to Medicare, and
the proceeds of sick, accident, or liability insurance policies.
      (3)    Receipts by bona fide charitable, religious and educational
organizations and associations, when those receipts are from casual
entertainment, amusements, sports events and health and welfare activities
conducted by bona fide charitable, religious and educational organizations and
associations.
      (4)    The income of religious, fraternal, charitable, scientific,
literary and educational institutions to the extent that such income is derived
from tax exempt real estate, tax exempt tangible or intangible property or tax
exempt activities, but only to the extent that the said income is exempt from
federal income tax.
      (5)   Dues, contributions and similar payments received by charitable,
religious, educational or literary organizations or labor unions, lodges and
similar  organizations.
      (6)    Alimony and child support received.
      (7)    Earnings and income of all individuals under eighteen years of age
earning six hundred dollars ($600.00) or less per annum, whether residents or
nonresidents.
      (8)   Compensation for personal injuries and/or for damages to property
by way of insurance or otherwise, but this exemption does not apply to
compensation paid for lost salaries or wages and/or to compensation from
punitive damages.
      (9)   Compensation paid to a precinct election official, to the extent
that such compensation does not exceed $1,000 annually.
      (10)   Parsonage allowance, to the extent of the rental allowance or

compensation.  The clergy must be duly ordained, commissioned, or licensed by a

to perform all sacraments of the religious body.
      (11)   Expenses deductible on Part 1 of federal form 2106 in accordance

same manner to which the related income is apportioned.
      (12)   The income of a public utility when that public utility is subject
to the tax levied under Section 5727.24 or 5727.30 of the Ohio Revised Code. 
However, subject to Section 5745 of the Ohio Revised Code, starting January 1,
2002 this exemption does not apply to the income of an electric company or
combined company, and starting January 1, 2004 it does not apply to the income
of a telephone company, as both are defined in Section 5727.01 of the Revised
code.
      (13)    For individual taxpayers only, gains from involuntary
conversions, cancellation of indebtedness, interest on Federal obligations,
items of income already taxed by the State from which the Village is
specifically prohibited from taxing, and income of decedent's estate during the
period of administration, except such income from the operation of a business.
      (14)   Income, salaries, wages, commissions and other compensation and

Constitution or any act of Congress limiting the power of the states or their
political subdivisions to impose net income taxes on income derived from

Ohio or any act of the Ohio General Assembly limiting the power of a
municipality to impose net income taxes.
         (Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.04  EFFECTIVE DATE.
   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to the income,

(Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.05  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)    Unless otherwise exempted in this chapter, each individual taxpayer
eighteen (18) years of age or older and any corporation, association, business
and/or other entity who engages in business, or whose income, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation are subject to the tax imposed by this
chapter and any corporation, association, business and/or other entity who
engages in business shall, whether or not a tax is due thereon, make and file a
final return on or before April 15 of each year, or on or before the federal
filing date if it is other than April 15th.  When a return is made for a fiscal
year or other period different from the calendar year, the return shall be
filed on the 15th day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or
period, or on or before the federal filing date if it is other than the 15th
day of the fourth month from the end of such fiscal year or period.
   (b)    The return shall be filed with the Tax Commissioner on a form or
forms furnished by or obtainable upon request from the Tax Commissioner, or on
an acceptable generic form as defined in this chapter, setting forth:
      (1)    The aggregate amounts of income, qualifying wages, commissions and
other compensation earned and/or received and gross receipts from business,
profession or other activity, less allowable expenses incurred in the
acquisition of such gross receipts earned during the preceding year and subject
to the tax;
      (2)    The amount of the tax imposed by this chapter on such earnings and
profits; and
      (3)    Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other
information as the Tax Commissioner may require, including a statement that the
figures used in the return are the figures used in the return for Federal
income tax adjusted to set forth only such income as is taxable under the
provisions of this chapter, and including but not limited to copies of all W-
2 forms, 1099 Miscellaneous Income Forms, page one of form 1040, Form 1120,
1120S (including (K-1), 2106 (including Schedule A of Form 1040), 1065,
Schedule C (including cost of goods manufactured and/or sold), Schedule E,
schedule F and any other Federal Schedules, if applicable.  For businesses the
entire Federal return and supporting schedules shall be submitted.
   (c)    The Tax Commissioner may extend the time for filing of the annual
return upon the request of the taxpayer.  The extended due date for
individuals, and for businesses not filing the extension request through the
Ohio Business Gateway, shall be the last day of the month following the month
to which the federal income tax due date has been extended.  For businesses
filing the extension request through the Ohio Business Gateway, the extended
due date shall be the last day of the month to which the due date of the
federal income tax return has been extended.  The Tax Commissioner may deny the
extension if the taxpayer fails to:
      (1)   File the request timely;
      (2)   Fails to file a copy of the federal extension request; or
      (3)   The taxpayer's income tax account with the Village is delinquent in
any way.  For each year for which an extension is requested a tentative return,
accompanied by payment of the amount of tax shown to be due thereon, must be
filed by the date the return is normally due.  Interest, but no penalty, shall
be assessed in those cases in which the return is filed and the final tax paid
within the period as extended.
   (d)    The taxpayer making the return shall, at the time of the filing
thereof, pay to the Tax Commissioner the amount of taxes shown as due thereon;
provided, however, that where any portion of the tax so due has been deducted
at the source pursuant to the provisions of Section
191.06, or where any portion of such tax has been paid by the taxpayer pursuant
to the provisions of Section
191.07, credit for the amount so paid shall be deducted from the amount shown
to be due and only the balance, if any, shall be due and payable at the time of
filing the final return. Within three months from the final determination of
any Federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village return showing income subject
to the Village tax based upon such final determination of federal tax
liability, and pay any additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for
refund of any overpayment.
   (e)    (1)   Any affiliated group which files a consolidated return for
federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the Internal Revenue
Code may file a consolidated return with the Village. 
      (2)   In the case of a corporation that carries on transactions with its
stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the Village
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Tax Commissioner shall
require such additional information as may be necessary to ascertain whether
net profits allocable to the Village are being distorted by the shifting of
income, apportionment of expenses or other devices available to a common
control. If the Tax Commissioner finds that a person's net profits allocable to
the Village are distorted by reason of transactions with stockholders or with
other corporations related by stock ownership, interlocking directorates or
transactions with such division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or
activity, or by some other method, he shall adjust such transactions so as to
produce a fair and proper allocation of net profits to the Village. If
necessary, the Tax Commissioner may require the filing of a consolidated
return.
   (f)    A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village is
entitled under the provisions of this chapter may have such overpayment applied
against any subsequent liability hereunder or, at his election indicated on the
return, such overpayment, or part thereof, shall be refunded, provided that no
additional taxes or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall be collected
or refunded.
   (g)    (1)   Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements or limitations, or both, contained in
Sections
191.01 through
191.05.  Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Tax Commissioner.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting (i.e.,
cash or accrual) or apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing
the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability, such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return showing income subject to Village tax
based upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (h)   Each taxpayer may offset business losses against business net profits
from any business conducted in the Village, and business losses or net profits
in any municipality that does not levy an income tax on net profits may be used
as offsets of business losses and net profits in the Village.
   (i)   Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.
   (j)   Business losses cannot be offset against income, qualifying wages,
commissions and other compensation that represent employee income and/or other
non-business income.
   (k)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein.  The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (l)   (1)   Retirees having no income considered taxable for Village income
tax purposes may file, with the Tax Commissioner, a written request for
exemption from these filing requirements, and shall be exempt if the request is
granted by the Tax Commissioner.  The request may be submitted by indicating,
on the taxpayer's annual tax return, the retirement date and the entity from
which retired.
      (2)   The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives income taxable to the Village, at which time the retiree shall be
required to comply with all applicable provisions of this chapter.
   (m)   The failure of any employer, taxpayer or person to receive or procure
a return, declaration, or other required form shall not excuse him from filing
any information return, tax return, declaration, or other required form, or
from paying the tax.
   (n)   Amended Returns.
      (1)   Where an amended return must be filed in order to report additional
tax due or claim a refund of tax overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or
limitations contained in this chapter, such amended return shall be on a form
obtainable on request from the Tax Commissioner.  A taxpayer may not change the
method of accounting (i.e., cash or accrual) or apportionment of new profits
after the due date for filing the original return.
      (2)   Within three months from the final determination of any federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's Village tax liability such taxpayer shall
make and file an amended Village return, showing income subject to the Village
based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay an
additional tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment.
         (Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE.
   (a)    Each employer within or doing business within the Village who employs
one or more persons on an income, qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis shall deduct at the time of the payment of such income,
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, the tax provided for in
Section
191.03 and shall make a return and pay to the Village Income Tax Office, the
amount of taxes so deducted, on a form or forms prescribed by or acceptable to
the Tax Commissioner as follows:
      (1)    If the total amount of tax withheld by an employer in the prior
calendar year averaged less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month the
employer shall, on or before the last day of the month following each calendar
quarter, make the return required by this section and pay the amount of taxes
so deducted during the preceding calendar quarter.  However, the Tax
Commissioner shall have the authority to require a taxpayer that is remitting
quarterly payments to begin remitting monthly payments if the conditions for
remitting quarterly payments were judged incorrectly, the conditions have
substantially changed so that it is in the best interest of the Village to
require monthly payments, and/or the taxpayer is delinquent in remitting
quarterly payments.
      (2)    An employer who deducts taxes amounting to one hundred dollars
($100.00) or more per month, based on the previous tax year's monthly average,
shall, on or before the last day of each month following that for which the
taxes were withheld, make the return required by this section and pay the
amount of taxes so deducted during the preceding calendar month. 
   (b)    The failure of an employer to withhold taxes required by this section
as required by law does not relieve an employee from the liability for the tax.
   (c)    Each employer required to deduct and withhold taxes is liable for the
payment of that amount required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld and such amount shall be deemed to be a
special fund in trust for the Village until such time as same is paid to the
Village.
   (d)    On or before February 28 of each year, each employer shall file a
withholding return setting forth the names, addresses, and social security
numbers of all employees from whose compensation the tax was withheld during
the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld from his or her
employees and such other information as may be required by the Tax
Commissioner.
   (e)    On or before February 28 of each year all individuals, businesses,
employers, brokers or other who engage persons, either on a fee or commission
basis or as independent contractors and not employees (those who are not
subject to withholding) must provide the Municipality with copies of all 1099
Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses, Social Security
numbers or federal identification numbers and a total amount of earnings,
payments, bonuses, commissions and/or fees paid to each person.
   (f)    The officer or the employee having control or supervision of or
charged with the responsibility for withholding the tax, and/or of filing the
report and making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report
or pay the tax due as required by this section. The dissolution of a
corporation or limited partnership does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation or limited
partnership to file returns or pay the tax due.
   (g)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the Village,
and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service shall, prior to
commencement of the service, provide the Village the names and addresses of the
subcontractors, and the individual who serves as the contact person.  The
subcontractors shall be responsible for complying with all applicable
requirements under this chapter.
(Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.07  DECLARATIONS.
   (a)    Every person who anticipates any taxable income which is not subject
in whole or in part to the withholding requirements of Section
191.06, or who engages in any business, profession, enterprise or activity
shall file a declaration setting forth such estimated income and/or the
estimated profit or loss from such business activity together with the
estimated tax due thereon, if any.  However, if a person's income is wholly
from income, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensations from which
the tax will be fully withheld and remitted to the Village in accordance with
this chapter, or if a person's annual income tax liability from which the tax
will not be fully withheld is less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), such
person need not file a declaration.
   (b)    Such declaration shall be filed on or before April 15 of each year
during the life of this chapter, or on or before the federal filing date if it
is other than April 15th. 
   (c)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration on
or before the 15th day of the fourth month after the beginning of each fiscal
year or period, or on or before the federal filing date if it is other than the

   (d)    Such declaration shall be filed upon a form or forms furnished by or
obtainable from the Tax Commissioner, or on an acceptable generic form as
defined in this Chapter, which form or forms may require a statement that the

declaration of the estimate for the Federal income tax adjusted to set forth
only such income as is taxable under the provisions of this chapter.
   (e)    Such declaration of estimated tax to be paid the Village shall be
accompanied by a payment of at least one-fourth of the estimated non-withheld
and/or under-withheld tax due.
      (1)   If the taxpayer is an individual, at least a similar amount shall
be paid on or before the last day of the seventh (7th), tenth (10th), and
thirteenth (13th) months after the beginning of the taxpayer's taxable year,
provided that in case an amended declaration has been filed, or the taxpayer is
taxable for a portion of the year only, the unpaid balance shall be paid in
equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (2)   If the taxpayer is a corporation or association, and whether
reporting on a calendar or fiscal tax year, at least a similar amount shall be
paid on or before the fifteenth day of the sixth (6th), ninth (9th), and
twelfth (12th) months of the taxable year; provided, however, that in case an
amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance shown due thereon shall
be paid in equal installments on or before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   No penalties or interest shall be assessed, for not filing a
declaration, if one or more of the following circumstances apply:
         A.   The resident taxpayer was not domiciled in the Village on the
first day of January in the year in which they became subject to estimated
payments.
         B.   The taxpayer has remitted an amount equal to one hundred percent
(100%) of the previous year's tax liability, provided that the previous year
reflected a twelve-month period and the taxpayer filed a return for that year.

due dates for any year in which the Federal due dates are other than those
contained in this provision.
(Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.08  DUTIES OF TAX COMMISSIONER.
   (a)   (1)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to collect and
receive the tax imposed by this chapter in the manner prescribed herein from
the taxpayers; to keep an accurate record thereof; and to report all money so
received.
      (2)   It shall be the duty of the Tax Commissioner to enforce payment of
all taxes owed to the Village, to keep accurate records for a minimum of six
(6) years showing the amount due from each taxpayer required to make any
return, including taxes withheld, and to show the dates and amounts of payments
thereof.
   (b)   The Tax Commissioner is hereby charged with the enforcement of the
provisions of this chapter, and is hereby empowered, subject to the approval of
the Board of Review, to adopt and promulgate and to enforce rules and
regulations relating to any matter or thing pertaining to the collection of
taxes and the administration and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter,
including provisions for the re-examination and corrections of returns. 
Taxpayers are required to comply with the requirements of this chapter and any
rules and regulations.
   (c)   The Tax Commissioner is authorized to arrange for the payment of
unpaid taxes, interest and penalties on a schedule of installment payments,
when the taxpayer has proved to the Tax Commissioner that, due to certain
hardship conditions, the taxpayer is unable to pay the full amount of tax due. 
Such authorization shall not be granted until proper returns are filed by the
taxpayer for all amounts owed by the taxpayer under this chapter.  Failure to
make any deferred payment when due shall cause the total unpaid amount,
including penalty and interest, to become payable on demand and the provisions
of Sections
 191.11 and
191.12 shall apply.
   (d)   In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return or has filed
a return which does not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax Commissioner
may determine the amount of tax appearing to be due the Village from the
taxpayer and shall send to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount
of tax so determined, together with interest and penalties thereon, if any. 
Such determination may be modified or amended based upon information or data
subsequently secured by or made available to the Tax Commissioner.  If the
taxpayer fails to respond to the assessment within 30 days, the tax, penalties,
and interest assessed shall become due and payable and collectible as are other
unpaid taxes, penalty, and interest.
   (e)   The Board of Review shall have the power to compromise any interest or
penalty, or both. 
(Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.09  INVESTIGATIVE POWERS OF TAX COMMISSIONER; PENALTY FOR  DIVULGING
CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.
   (a)    The Tax Commissioner, an authorized employee, or the designee of the
Tax Commissioner, is hereby authorized to examine the books, papers, records
and federal and state income tax returns of any employer or of any taxpayer or
person subject to the tax for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any
return made or, if no return was made, to ascertain the tax due under this
chapter. Every such employer, supposed employer, taxpayer or supposed taxpayer
is hereby directed and required to furnish, within ten (10) calendar days
following a written request by the Tax Commissioner or his duly authorized
agent or employee, the means, facilities and opportunity for making such
examinations and investigations as are hereby authorized.
   (b)    The Tax Commissioner is hereby authorized to order any person to
appear at the office of the Tax Commissioner and examine any person, under
oath, concerning any income which was or should have been returned for taxation
or any transaction tending to affect such income, and for this purpose may
compel the production of books, papers, records and federal and state income
tax returns and the attendance of all persons before him, whether as parties or
witnesses, whenever he believes such persons have knowledge of such income or
information pertinent to such inquiry.
   (c)    The refusal to produce books, papers, records and federal and state
income tax returns, or the refusal of such examination by any employer or
person subject or presumed to be subject to the tax or by any officer, agent or
employee of a person subject to the tax or required to withhold tax, or the
failure of any person to comply with the provisions of this section or with an
order or subpoena of the Tax Commissioner authorized hereby shall be deemed a
violation of this chapter, punishable as provided in Section
191.12.
   (d)   Every taxpayer shall maintain, and retain for a period of six (6)
years after the date a declaration or return is due or withholding taxes paid,
all records necessary to exhibit and compute his liability for taxes due or to
be withheld under the provisions of this chapter. 
   (e)    Any information gained as the result of any returns, investigations,
hearings or verifications required or authorized by this chapter shall be
confidential except for official tax purposes or except in accordance with
proper judicial order.  Any person divulging such information in violation of
this chapter shall be deemed guilty of a first-degree misdemeanor and fined not
more than one thousand dollars ($1,000) or imprisonment for not more than six
(6) months, or both.  Each disclosure shall constitute a separate offense.
(Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-19-11.)
191.10  INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNPAID TAXES; LATE FILING PENALTY.
   (a)    All taxes imposed, including estimated taxes, and all moneys withheld
or required to be withheld by employers, under the provisions of this chapter
and remaining unpaid after they become due shall bear interest at the rate of
one-half of one percent (1/2%) per month or fraction of a month.
   (b)    In addition to interest as provided in subsection (a) hereof,
penalties based on the unpaid tax are hereby imposed as follows:
      (1)    For failure to pay taxes, including estimated payments, when due,
other than taxes withheld, one and one-half percent (1-1/2%) per month or
fraction of a month, but not less than $25.00.
      (2)    For failure to remit taxes withheld from employees, five percent
(5%) per month or fraction of a month.

paid thereon within the time prescribed by the Tax Commissioner; and provided
further, that, in the absence of fraud, neither penalty nor interest shall be
assessed on any additional tax assessment resulting from a federal audit,
providing an amended return is filed, and the additional tax is paid within
three months after final determination of the federal tax liability.
   (d)    The taxpayer may request an abatement of penalty, interest, or both. 
Said request must be in writing, addressed to the Tax Commissioner and
presented to the Tax Commissioner setting forth the facts the taxpayer would
like the Income Tax Review Board to consider in making a determination
regarding said request.  The Income Tax Review Board shall meet and make a
determination within sixty (60) days after the Tax Commissioner receives a
request and may abate penalty or interest, or both.  (Ord. 11-30.  Passed 12-
19-11.)
191.11  COLLECTION OF UNPAID TAXES AND REFUNDS OF OVERPAYMENTS.
   (a)   All taxes imposed by this chapter shall be collectible, together with
any interest and penalties, by suit.  All additional assessments shall be made
and all actions to recover municipal income taxes and penalties and interest
thereon shall be brought within three years after the tax was due or the return
was filed, whichever is later.  However, in the case of fraud, omission of 25%
or more of income subject to this tax, or failure to file a return, all
additional assessments shall be made and all prosecutions to recover municipal
income taxes and penalties and interest thereon shall be brought within six (6)
years after the tax was due or the return was filed, whichever is later.
   (b)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded, unless a claim for a
refund is made. Claims for refund of municipal income taxes must be brought
within three years after the tax was paid or the return was filed, whichever is
later.  In addition, the following shall apply regarding refunds of tax
withheld from non-qualified deferred compensation plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
where that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP, and
upon which municipal tax was withheld, will be issued a refund on the amount
representing the difference between the deferred income that was taxed and the
income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applied to the deferral
tax years, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used to
compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (c)   Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Ottawa, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Ottawa as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the Village of
Ottawa, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the Village of Ottawa.  The Village of Ottawa will allow a non-
refundable credit for any amount owed the Village of Ottawa that is in excess
of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the tax rate
of the other municipality is the same or higher than the Village of Ottawa's
tax rate.  If the Village of Ottawa's tax rate is higher, the tax representing
the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by the Village of
Ottawa

Individuals.
   (A)     For residents of the Village of Ottawa, the income tax levied herein
shall be on all income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other
compensation from whatever source earned or received by the resident, including
the resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities
owned directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the
resident.  This is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
193.02 (C)(16)).
   (B)     For nonresidents, all income, salaries, qualifying wages,
commissions, and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by
the nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (C)     For residents and nonresidents, income can be reduced to "Municipal
Taxable Income" as defined in Section

plan described in Section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         (b)    "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable
to a taxpayer's nonqualified deferred compensation plan, less the receipt of
money and property attributable to distributions from the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of money and
property is made by the nonqualified deferred compensation plan. The taxpayer

receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (c)   (i)    "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for
the taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the Village of
Ottawa with respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the
payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
            (ii)    If different tax rates applied for different taxable years,
then the "qualifying tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the Village of
Ottawa each year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         (d)    "Refundable credit" means the amount of the Village of Ottawa
income tax that was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)    If, in addition to the Village of Ottawa, a taxpayer has paid tax
to other municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each
municipal corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal
corporation's proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax
paid by the taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)    In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the
Village of Ottawa for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (4)    The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

preponderance of the evidence that the individual was not domiciled in the
Village of Ottawa for all or part of the taxable year.

         (i)    The number of contact periods the individual has with the
Village of Ottawa. For the purposes of this division, an individual has one

from the individual's abode located outside of the Village of Ottawa and while
away overnight from that abode spends at least some portion, however minimal,
of each of two consecutive days in the Village of Ottawa. 
      (3)     All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

profession in the Village of Ottawa, unless the taxpayer is an individual who
resides in the Village of Ottawa or the taxpayer is an electric company,
combined company, or telephone company that is subject to and required to file
reports under Chapter 5745 of the ORC.
      (1)    Except as otherwise provided in division (F)(2) of this section,
net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without the

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the Village of Ottawa during the taxable period to the average original cost
of all of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer
in the business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
      As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real property
shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight;
         (b)    Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the Village of Ottawa to wages, salaries, and other compensation
paid during the same period to individuals employed in the business or

compensation from which taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
193.04 (C);
         (c)    Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales
and rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the
Village of Ottawa to total gross receipts of the business or profession during
the same period from sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   (a)    If the apportionment factors described in division (F)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the Village of Ottawa, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax

respect to all or any portion of the income of the taxpayer, an alternative
apportionment method involving one or more of the following:
            (i)    Separate accounting;
            (ii)    The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            (iii)    The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            (iv)    A modification of one or more of the factors.
         (b)    A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
193.12 (A).
         (c)    The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (F)(2)(a) of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
193.12 (A).
         (d)    Nothing in division (F)(2) of this section nullifies or
otherwise affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by a the
Tax Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)    As used in division (F)(1)(b) of this section, "wages, salaries,

under the possession of one of the following:

a related member of such a vendor, customer, client, or patient;

vendor, customer, client, or patient.
         (b)    Any location at which a trial, appeal, hearing, investigation,
inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
         (c)    Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that
the employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other
location in lieu of a location described in division (F) (3)(a) or (b) of this
section solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's municipal income tax
liability. If the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer
may dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the
evidence, that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.
      (4)    For the purposes of division (F)(1)(c) of this section, receipts
from sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a
municipal corporation as follows:

of Ottawa from a stock of goods located within the Village of Ottawa.
            (ii)    The property is delivered within the Village of Ottawa from

within the Village of Ottawa and the sales result from such solicitation or
promotion.
            (iii)    The property is shipped from a place within the Village of
Ottawa to purchasers outside the Village of Ottawa, provided that the taxpayer

which the tangible personal property is used in the Village of Ottawa.
      (5)    The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the Village of Ottawa's tax only
if the property generating the net profit is located in the Village of Ottawa
or if the individual taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the

of real estate everywhere in the taxable year.
         (b)    An individual who is a resident of the Village of Ottawa shall
report the individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the
individual's annual tax return for the Village of Ottawa. The individual may
claim a credit for taxes the individual paid on such net profit to another
municipal corporation to the extent that such a credit is allowed under the
Village of Ottawa's income tax ordinance.

section for the purposes of that division or division (F)(2) of this section,

business in the Village of Ottawa shall withhold an income tax from the
qualifying wages earned and/or received by each employee in the Village of
Ottawa.  Except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required
under Section
193.03 or division (B)(4) or (6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld at
the rate, specified in Section
193.03 of this chapter, of 1%.  An employer, agent of an employer, or other
payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date that
the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or constructively
pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to the benefit
of, the employee.
   (B)   (1)    Except as provided in division (B)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the Village of Ottawa the greater of the income taxes deducted
and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the
employer, agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         (a)   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted

or if the total amount of taxes deducted and withheld or required to be
deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Ottawa in any month of the
preceding calendar quarter exceeded $200.
      Payments under division (B)(1)(a) of this section shall be made to the
Tax Administrator not later than 15 days after the last day of each month for
which the tax was withheld.
         (b)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required

to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under Section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other federal statute or regulation, the
payment shall be made by electronic funds transfer to the Tax Administrator of
all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the Village of Ottawa. The payment
of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not affect an
employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return as required
under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by Tax Administrator and the Village of Ottawa as
the return required of an non- resident employee whose sole income subject to
the tax under this chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the Village of Ottawa income tax with respect to an individual's
disqualifying disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the
disqualifying disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the
corporation with respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such
corporation's successor entity.
      (5)   (a)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         (b)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the Village of Ottawa the tax withheld relieves the employee from
liability for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent,
or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
Village of Ottawa income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the
extent the deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the
time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Village of Ottawa until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:

withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;

      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold the Village of
Ottawa income tax on tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees
and constituting qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and
gratuities are under the employer's control. For the purposes of this division,
a tip or gratuity is under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is
paid by the customer to the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee,
or if the customer pays the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or
other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.  (Ord. 17-11.  Passed 12-11-17.)

or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more municipal
corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days that is
greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other municipal
corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's qualifying wages
subject to division (C)(2)(a)(i) of this section among those two or more
municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
      For the purposes of this division, the location at which an employee
spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with division (C)(2)

professional entertainer, or public figure.
         (b)    For the purposes of division (C)(2)(a) of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
Village of Ottawa only if the employee spent more time performing services for
or on behalf of the employer in the Village of Ottawa than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount

employer;
            (v)    Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform

      (3)    If the principal place of work of an employee is located in
another Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception
from withholding requirements described in division (C)(2)(a) of this section
shall apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described
in that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying
wages to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   (a)    Except as provided in division (C)(4)(b) of this section,
if, during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing

employer shall withhold and remit tax to the Village of Ottawa for any
subsequent days in that calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying
wages to the employee for personal services performed in the Village of Ottawa.
         (b)    An employer required to begin withholding tax for the Village

year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator with the
employer's federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)    Divisions (C)(2)(a) and (4) of this section shall not apply to the
extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement
regarding the manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements
of Section
193.04.  (Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (A)   An annual Village of Ottawa income tax return shall be completed and

      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section

      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal Taxable Income for Village of Ottawa
income tax purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption
from these filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
The written exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from

this chapter.
   (B)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.

      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return, and amended return, copies of the
following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2,
"Wage and Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's
federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal  Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form

to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
   A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net profit
return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other manner
shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Village of Ottawa to determine and verify the
taxpayer's municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under
division (F) of this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on
a generic form or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (G)   (1)   (a)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be

forms, together with remittance made payable to the Village of Ottawa.  No
remittance is required if the net amount due is ten dollars or less.
         (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day (15th) of the fourth month following the end of

      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the Village of Ottawa's
income tax return. The extended due date of the Village of Ottawa's income tax
return shall be the 15th day of the tenth month after the last day of the
taxable year to which the return relates. An extension of time to file under
this division is not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax
Administrator grants an extension of that date.
         (a)   A copy of the federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the Village of Ottawa's income tax return.
         (b)   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six- month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's Village of Ottawa income tax
return.  If the  request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the
date the Village of Ottawa income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator
shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
      (3)   If the state tax commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date
for filing state income tax returns under division (G) of Section 5747.08 of
the ORC, a taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of
the Village of Ottawa's income tax return. The extended due date of the Village
of Ottawa's income tax return shall be the same as the extended due date of the
state income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Village of Ottawa, the Tax Administrator
may require taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as
provided in this division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file
annual returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (G) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (N), (O), (P), or (Q) prevail.
   (H)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Village of Ottawa
shall not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the
net amount due is ten dollars or less.
      (2)    Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Village of Ottawa
for a taxable year pursuant to division (H)(1) of this section shall file with
the Village of Ottawa an annual net profit return under division (F)(3) of this
section, unless the provisions of division (H)(3) apply.
      (3)   (a)   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person
does not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the Village of Ottawa income tax
ordinance for a taxable year if both the following apply:
            (i)   The person was required to file a tax return with the Village
of Ottawa for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location (as defined in Section 4(C)(1)(g))
within the Village of Ottawa.
            (ii)   The person no longer provides services in the Village of
Ottawa and does not expect to be subject to the Village of Ottawa income tax
for the taxable year.
         (b)   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the Village of Ottawa.  The affidavit shall
also include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the Village of Ottawa, make any sales in the Village of Ottawa,
or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the Village of Ottawa during
the taxable year.  If the affiant does become subject to the tax levied by
Village of Ottawa for the taxable year, the affiant agrees to be considered a
taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with Village of Ottawa income tax
ordinance and rules and regulations."  The person shall sign the affidavit
under penalty of perjury.
         (c)   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (H)(3)(b)
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         (d)   Nothing in division (H)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (I)   If a payment under this chapter is made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment shall be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp
assigned by the first electronic system receiving that payment.
   (J)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Ottawa by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
193.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the Village of Ottawa, unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Village of Ottawa and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (K)   Each return required by the Village of Ottawa to be filed in
accordance with this division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check
to authorize another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the
return, to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to
the return.
   (L)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the Village of Ottawa,
provided that the generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the
information required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted
by the Village of Ottawa or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the
taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the generic form otherwise complies with
the provisions of this chapter and of the Village of Ottawa's ordinance,
resolution, or rules and regulations governing the filing of returns, reports,
or documents.

amounts shown to be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)    Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the

Extension for service in or for the armed forces.
   (N)    Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the armed forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the president of the United
States or an act of the congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the armed forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of Village of
Ottawa for both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension
of time for payment of taxes required by the Village of Ottawa during the
period of the member's or civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter.
The application shall be filed on or before the one hundred eightieth day after
the member's or civilian's duty terminates. An applicant shall provide such
evidence as the Tax Administrator considers necessary to demonstrate
eligibility for the extension.
   (O)   (1)    If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate.  However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. 
      (2)    If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Village of Ottawa before the 181st day after the
applicant's active duty or service terminates.
      (3)     Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under (O)(1) of
this division are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require any
payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period. 
   (P)   (1)    Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (N) and (O) of this section.
      (2)   (a)    A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Village of Ottawa in
accordance with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under
division (P)(2)(a) of this section shall be equal to the length of the
corresponding extension that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue
Code. As used in this division, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the
national guard or a member of a reserve component of the armed forces of the
United States called to active duty pursuant to either an executive order

contingency operation in support of the armed forces.
         (b)    Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (P)
(2)(a) of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (C)(2)(a) of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.

Consolidated municipal income tax return.
   (R)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in Section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

return filed for federal income tax purposes pursuant to Section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)    "Consolidated federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local

   (S)   (1)    For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the Village of
Ottawa's income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of
corporations filed a consolidated federal income tax return with respect to
that taxable year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning
with the first taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the
reporting method is required under federal law. The election continues to be
binding for each subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to
discontinue filing consolidated municipal income tax returns under division (S)
(2) of this section or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax
Administrator. The Tax Administrator shall approve such a request for good
cause shown. 
      (2)    An election to discontinue filing consolidated municipal income
tax returns under this section must be made in the first year following the
last year of a five-year consolidated municipal income tax return election
period in effect under division (S)(1) of this section. The election to
discontinue filing a consolidated municipal income tax return is binding for a
five-year period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)    An election made under division (S)(1) or (2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
municipal income tax.
   (T)    A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated Village of Ottawa income tax return for that taxable year
if the Tax Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that
intercompany transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that
there has been a distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to
allocation of net profits to the Village of Ottawa. A taxpayer that is required
to file a consolidated Village of Ottawa income tax return for a taxable year
shall file a consolidated Village of Ottawa income tax return for all
subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and receives written
permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate return or a taxpayer
has experienced a change in circumstances.

taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)    No corporation filing a consolidated Village of Ottawa income tax
return shall make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
193.02 (C)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated federal taxable income.
        (3)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at
least eighty percent (80%) of the value of its ownership interest owned or
controlled, directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is
included in that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a
taxable year, the corporation filing a consolidated Village of Ottawa income
tax return shall do one of the following with respect to that pass-through
entity's net profit or loss for that taxable year:
         (a)    Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Ottawa. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         (b)    Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the

Section
193.05, include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Ottawa. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)    If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less
than eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         (a)    The corporation filing the consolidated municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit sitused to the
Village of Ottawa;
         (b)    The pass-through entity shall be subject to the Village of
Ottawa income taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter
on the basis of the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in
the consolidated federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (W)    Corporations filing a consolidated Village of Ottawa income tax
return shall make the computations required under divisions (R) through (Y) of
Section
193.05 by substituting "consolidated federal taxable income attributable to"
for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in that section and by
substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for "taxpayer" wherever
"taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (X)    Each corporation filing a consolidated Village of Ottawa income tax
return is jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines,
charges, or other amounts imposed by the Village of Ottawa in accordance with
this chapter on the corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation
is a member for any portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of
such an affiliated group.
   (Y)    Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the Village of Ottawa before January 1, 2016, to file a
consolidated or combined tax return with the Village of Ottawa may continue to
file consolidated or combined tax returns in accordance with such election or
agreement for taxable years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

193.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (A)   As used in this section:

   (B)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if
the amount payable as estimated taxes is at least $200. For the purposes of
this section:
         (a)   Taxes withheld for the Village of Ottawa from qualifying wages
shall be considered as paid to the Village of Ottawa in equal amounts on each
payment date unless the taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts
were actually withheld, in which case they shall be considered as paid on the
dates on which the amounts were actually withheld.
         (b)   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent
taxable year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the

taxpayer becomes subject to tax for the first time.
      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after the beginning
of each fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (C)   (1)    The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the Village of
Ottawa, including the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and
withholding on or before the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         (a)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent (22.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (b)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the sixth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent (45%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         (c)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the ninth month after
the beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent (67.5%) of
the tax liability for the taxable year;
         (d)   For an individual, on or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the
first month of the following taxable year, ninety percent (90%) of the tax
liability for the taxable year.  For a person other than an individual, on or
before the fifteenth (15th) day of the twelfth month of the taxable year,
ninety percent (90%) of the tax liability for the taxable year.
      (2)   When an amended declaration has been filed, the unpaid balance
shown due on the amended declaration shall be paid in equal installments on or
before the remaining payment dates.
      (3)   On or before the fifteenth (15th) day of the fourth month of the

   (D)   (1)    In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

and one-half percent (22.5%) of the tax liability, less the amount of taxes

division (D) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

percent (90%) of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least one
hundred percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for
the preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable 
year  reflected  a  period  of  twelve  months  and  the  taxpayer  filed  a   
return  with the Village of Ottawa under Section
193.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the Village of Ottawa
but was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year
that includes the first day of the taxable year.
         (Ord. 17-11.  Passed 12-11-17.)
193.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required
under this chapter. Any fractional part of a dollar that equals or exceeds

(Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
193.18.
   (B)    Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by Municipality:
      (1)    Overpayments of ten dollars or more;
      (2)    Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars or
more.
   (C)   (1)    Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)    On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (C)
(3) of this section, the administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)    If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
193.21.
   (D)    A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (C) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)    The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)    The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)    The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (E)    Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer
of any municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until
the date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within 90 days after the final filing date of the annual return or 90
days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no interest shall
be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the payment of interest
on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year shall be considered
to have been paid before the date on which the return on which the tax is
reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for filing that
return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in Section
193.18(A)(4).  (Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (A)    Income tax that has been deposited with the Village of Ottawa, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the
Village of Ottawa as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.
   (B)    Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the Village of Ottawa is subject to recovery by the
Village of Ottawa.  If the Village of Ottawa's tax on that income is imposed
after the time period allowed for a refund of the tax or withholding paid to
the other municipality, the Village of Ottawa shall allow a nonrefundable
credit against the tax or withholding the Village of Ottawa claims is due with
respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to the
first municipality with respect to such income or wages. 
   (C)    If the Village of Ottawa's tax rate is less than the tax rate in the
other municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
Village of Ottawa's tax rate.  However, if the Village of Ottawa's tax rate is
greater than the tax rate in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of
the nonrefundable credit is to be paid to the Village of Ottawa, along with any
penalty and interest that accrued during the period of nonpayment.
   (D)    Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (A)   (1)    If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return
for the Village of Ottawa changes as a result of an adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an
amended return with the Village of Ottawa. The amended return shall be filed on
a form required by the Tax Administrator.
      (2)    If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (B)   (1)    In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall reopen those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously filed return
that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's federal or state income tax return only:
         (i)    to determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         (ii)    if the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
193.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)    The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (C)   (1)    In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be
filed under this division within the period prescribed by division (D) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars, no refund
need be paid by the Village of Ottawa. A request filed under this division
shall claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to
the taxpayer's federal or state income tax return, unless it is also filed
within the time prescribed in Section
193.09.
      (2)    The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.  All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (D)    Within 60 days after the final determination of any federal or state
tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Ottawa's tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Ottawa return showing income
subject to the Village of Ottawa income tax based upon such final determination
of federal or state tax liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional
Village of Ottawa income tax shown due thereon or make a claim for refund of
any overpayment, unless the tax or overpayment is less than ten dollars.
(Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.12  LIMITATIONS.
   (A)   (1)   (a)    Civil actions to recover municipal income taxes and
penalties and interest on municipal income taxes shall be brought within the
later of:
            (i)    Three years after the tax was due or the return was filed,
whichever is later; or
            (ii)    One year after the conclusion of the qualifying deferral
period, if any.
         (b)    The time limit described in division (A)(1)(a) of this section
may be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer,
agent of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the
extension. Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time
limit described in division (C) of this section.
      (2)    As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         (a)    Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an
assessment files with the Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
193.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Tax Review did
not have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part
of that assessment.
         (b)    Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which
the final determination of the Board of Tax Review becomes final or, if any
party appeals from the determination of the Board of Tax Review, the sixtieth
day after the date on which the final determination of the Board of Tax Review
is either ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no
further appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that
reversal is available or taken.
   (B)    Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent (25%) or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (C)    A claim for a refund of municipal income taxes shall be brought
within the time limitation provided in Section
193.09.
   (D)   (1)    Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Village of Ottawa does not
prejudice any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)    If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Tax Review, or the Ohio Board
of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio board of tax
appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
193.09, with interest on that amount as provided by division (E) of Section
193.09.
   (E)    No civil action to recover the Village of Ottawa income tax or
related penalties or interest shall be brought during either of the following
time periods:
      (1)    The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)    The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of
that tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
         (Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.13  AUDITS.
   (A)    At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator
shall provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (B)    Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (C)    At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (D)    A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (E)    The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (F)    If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 15-18. Passed 10-26-15.)
193.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (A)    As used in this section:
      (1)    "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has
at the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC.
      (2)    "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of the ORC is
not able to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the
reason for non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept
the assessment.
   (B)    Subject to division (C) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC.  With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (C)   (1)   (a)    If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, a Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a new
last known address, including the use of a change of address service offered by
the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Section 5703.056 of
the ORC. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within 60 days after the
assessment's postmark.
         (b)    Once the Tax Administrator or other Village of Ottawa official,
or the designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the
assessment is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by
filing an appeal with the local board of tax review within 60 days after the
receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator
under division (C)(1)(a) of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery
is complete and that the assessment is served.
      (2)    If mailing of an assessment by a Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
   "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under applicable
law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax Administrator
as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an appeal may be filed
apply from and after that date."
   Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address, the
mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
   If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (C)(1)(a) of this
section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service under
this division in accordance with division (D) of this section.
   (D)   (1)    A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service
under division (C) of this section bears the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent
by certified mail was not an address with which the person was associated at
the time the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the
address; or if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least 20 percent, as determined
by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)    If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (D)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within  60
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other Village
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the local board of tax review.
   
   (E)    Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by a Tax Administrator
by personal service.
   (F)    Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (C)(1)(b) of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (G)    Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (A)    As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the Village of Ottawa that arises pursuant to the Village of Ottawa's income
tax imposed in accordance with this chapter.
   (B)    Nothing in this chapter prohibits a Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the Village
of Ottawa:
      (1)    Compromise a claim;
      (2)    Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (C)    The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-
time agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be
appealable.
   (D)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (E)    A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.  (Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (A)    Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the Village of
Ottawa as authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee
thereof may furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this
chapter and other related tax information to the internal revenue service, the
tax commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (B)    This section does not prohibit the Village of Ottawa from publishing
or disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with
respect to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 15-18.  Passed 10-26-15.)
193.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the Village of Ottawa ordinance or
state law to be filed with a the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,
schedule, statement, claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend,
or knowingly procure, counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment
of the records upon which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or
document is based with intent to defraud the Village of Ottawa or the Tax
Administrator.

tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee

papers, records, and federal and state income tax returns in such person's

attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.

requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's social security
number, federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.

identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with

identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section

         (c)    The penalties provided for under divisions (C)(2)(a) and (b) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee

to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
193.99 for a violation of Section
193.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by

   (E)    The Board of Tax Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Tax
Review shall issue a final determination on the appeal within 90 days after the
Board of Tax Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within 15

separate households are maintained in the structure or structures.  "Private
residential property" does not include any private property on which is located
one or more structures that are used as a home, residence or sleeping place by

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator
may pay not more than one-half of that fee to obtain release of the motor
vehicle.  That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the towing
service uses a mobile credit card processor and mobile service is not available
at the time of the transaction. 
   Upon payment of the applicable fee, the towing service shall give the
vehicle owner or operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally
assessed and the actual amount received and shall release the motor vehicle to
the owner or operator.  Upon its release, the owner or operator immediately
shall move it so that it is not on the private residential or private
agricultural property without the permission of the person having the right to
possession of the property, or is not at the garage or place of storage without
the permission of the owner, whichever is applicable.
   (c)   (1)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of motor vehicles

to a particular motor vehicle to any person who, either in person or pursuant
to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

storage pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section may reclaim it upon both
of the following:
         A.   Payment of all applicable fees established by the Public
Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 or, if the

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a

owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.

misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.60)
   303.082 PRIVATE TOW-AWAY ZONES.
   (a)   The owner of a private property may establish a private tow-away zone,
but may do so only if all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The owner of the private property posts on the property a sign,
that is at least eighteen inches by twenty-four inches in size, that is visible
from all entrances to the property, and that includes all of the following
information:
         A.   A statement that the property is a tow-away zone;
         B.   A description of persons authorized to park on the property.  If
the property is a residential property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign  a statement that only tenants and guests may park in the
private tow-away zone, subject to the terms of the property owner.  If the
property is a commercial property, the owner of the private property may
include on the sign a statement that only customers may park in the private
tow-away zone.  In all cases, if it is not apparent which persons may park in
the private tow-away zone, the owner of the private property shall include on
the sign the address of the property on which the private tow-away zone is
located, or the name of the business that is located on the property designated
as a private tow-away zone.
         C.   If the private tow-away zone is not enforceable at all times, the
times during which the parking restrictions are enforced;
         D.   The telephone number and the address of the place from which a
towed vehicle may be recovered at any time during the day or night;
         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.
      (2)   A towing service ensures that a vehicle towed under this section is
taken to a location from which it may be recovered that complies with all of
the following:
         A.   It is located within twenty-five linear miles of the location of
the private tow-away zone, unless it is not practicable to take the vehicle to
a place of storage within twenty-five linear miles.
         B.   It is well-lighted.
         C.   It is on or within a reasonable distance of a regularly scheduled
route of one or more modes of public transportation, if any public
transportation is available in the municipal corporation or township in which
the private tow-away zone is located.

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains
unclaimed as provided in Ohio R.C. 4505.101.  The owner or lienholder of a
vehicle that has been removed under this section, subject to subsection (c) of
this section, may recover the vehicle in accordance with subsection (g) of this
section.
      (2)   If a municipal corporation requires tow trucks and tow truck
operators to be  licensed, no owner of a private property located within the
municipal corporation shall cause the removal and storage of any vehicle
pursuant to subsection (b) of this section by an unlicensed tow truck or
unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered
into with the owner of the private property on which the private tow-away zone
is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by
use of a major credit card unless the towing service uses a mobile credit card
processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.
   The towing service shall record the time and date of the photographs taken
under this section.  The towing service shall retain the photographs and the
record of the time and date, in electronic or printed form, for at least thirty
days after the date on which the vehicle is recovered by the owner or
lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be
recovered;
         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if
the vehicle remains unclaimed, to the owner’s and lienholder’s last known
address by certified or express mail with return receipt requested or by a
commercial carrier service utilizing any form of delivery requiring a signed
receipt;
         B.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed thirty days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section;
         C.   If the vehicle remains unclaimed forty-five days after the first
notice is sent, in the manner required under subsection (f)(1)A. of this
section.
      (2)   Sixty days after any notice sent pursuant to subsection (f)(1) of
this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.
      (4)   With respect to a vehicle concerning which a towing service or

vehicle all photographs taken under subsection (d) of this section.  Upon
request, the towing service or storage facility shall provide a copy of all

electronic, or otherwise.
      (3)   When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the

vehicle was lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under
Ohio R.C. 4513.611.

303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
   303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY
WITHOUT PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
   303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,

      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the total amount
of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender

court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

   313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
   313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane- use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05, pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05 or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

being made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

   (a)   Whenever special pedestrian control signals exhibiting the words
“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical  technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood
under this subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section. 
            (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)

      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this

otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.

drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy- five dollars
($1,075).

this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.  The court shall impose the ten- day mandatory jail term
under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it
instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term
and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol
monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol
monitoring.  The court   may impose a jail term in addition to the ten-day
mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall
not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.

(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s license,
commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

have driven, and in charges made in reliance upon subsection (c) hereof also
the speed which subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section declares is prima-facie lawful at the time
and place of such alleged violation, except that in affidavits where a person
is alleged to have driven at a greater speed than will permit the person to
bring the vehicle to a stop within the assured clear distance ahead the
affidavit and warrant need not specify the speed at which the defendant is
alleged to have driven.
   (f)   When a speed in excess of both a prima-facie limitation and a
limitation in subsection (d) hereof is alleged, the defendant shall be charged
in a single affidavit, alleging a single act, with a violation indicated of
both subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or of a limit declared or
established pursuant to this section by the Director or local authorities, and
of the limitation in subsection (d) hereof.  If the court finds a violation of
subsection (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof, or a limit declared or established
pursuant to this section has occurred, it shall enter a judgment of conviction
under such subsection and dismiss the charge under subsection (d) hereof.  If
it finds no violation of subsections (b)(1)A. to (b)(6) hereof or a limit
declared or established pursuant to this section, it shall then consider
whether the evidence supports a conviction under subsection (d) hereof.
   (g)   Points shall be assessed for violation of a limitation under
subsection (d) hereof in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.036.
   (h)   Whenever, in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.21 or this section, the

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s
or commercial driver’s license, if the person has a valid license to operate a
motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

the offender may be ordered pursuant to division (C) of that section to serve a
term of community service of up to five hundred hours.
The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

have more than one valid license at any time. 
(ORC 4507.02)
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever

or in an occupant restraining device as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.263.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section has
been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons for a violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section
or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of subsection (c) or (d) of this section, and absent another
violation of law, a law enforcement officer’s view of the interior or visual
inspection of a motor vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not
be used for the purpose of determining whether a violation of subsection (c) or
(d) of this section has been or is being committed.
   (f)   The Ohio Director of Public Safety shall adopt such rules as are
necessary to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a
child restraint system, a booster seat or an occupant restraining device as
required by this section is not negligence imputable to the child, is not
admissible as evidence in any civil action involving the rights of the child
against any other person allegedly liable for injuries to the child, is not to
be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the operator of the motor
vehicle other than a prosecution for a violation of this section, and is not
admissible as evidence in any criminal action involving the operator of the

otherwise would be required to be restrained under this section has a physical
impairment that makes use of a child restraint system, booster seat or an
occupant restraining device impossible or impractical, provided that the person
operating the vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in
accordance with any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted
on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the
child, but the production of a valid birth certificate for a child showing that
the child was not of an age to which this section applies is a defense against
any ticket, citation or summons issued for violating this section.
   (j)   Whoever violates subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section shall
be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator of a motor
vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system, booster
seat, or occupant restraining device as required by this section that occurred
at the same time, on the same day, and at the same location is deemed to be a
single violation of this section:
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (j)(2) of this section,
the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not less than
twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars ($75.00).
      (2)   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty
to a violation of subsection (a), (b), (c) or (d) of this section or of a state
law or municipal ordinance that is substantially similar to any of those
subsections, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.

of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that
would be applicable if the offense had been committed within this Municipality.
   (e)   Any act, conduct, or element that is a basis of a person being subject

   501.06  LIMITATION OF CRIMINAL PROSECUTION.
   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, a prosecution shall be
barred unless it is commenced within the following periods after an offense is
committed:
      (1)   For misdemeanor other than a minor misdemeanor, two years;
      (2)   For a minor misdemeanor, six months.
   (b)   If the period of limitation provided in subsection (a) hereof has

fraud or breach of a fiduciary duty, within one year after discovery of the
offense either by an aggrieved person, or by his legal representative who is
not himself a party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in this section has
expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the following offenses during the
following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a  public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself

against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect

      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the

   501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
 
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08.
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
   501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
   501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
   501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
 501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
         "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
   501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
   501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
   501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount
of restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution,
the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended
by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
         All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of
economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the
victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
         If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
         The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case
file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the
payment terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it
may modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
(ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this section
and the court assigns the offender to a county jail that has established a
county jail industry program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the court shall
specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be considered for
participation in the program.  During the offender’s term in the county jail,
the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification regarding the
offender’s participation in the county jail industry program.
      (4)   If a person is sentenced to a jail term pursuant to this section,
the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.28 a
reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in which the term
is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio R.C. 307.93,
341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56, or 2947.19 and
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in
subsection (b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the clerk of the court may issue a certificate
of judgment against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in subsection (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
            (ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Organizations.  Regardless of the penalties provided in subsections
(a) and (b) hereof, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
501.11 shall be fined, in accordance with this section.  The court shall fix
the fine as follows:
 
Type of Misdemeanor                            Maximum Fine

pressure. It is based upon a reference pressure of 20 micropascals (zero
decibels) which is the average threshold of hearing for a human with acute
hearing. The decibel scale is logarithmic, and as such, an increase or decrease
of 3 dB is a doubling or halving of sound pressure.
   (m)   “Emergency energy release device” means a device used specifically to
release excess energy on a non-scheduled basis as necessary for purposes of
safety and not as a part of routine process control.

are differentiated from extraneous sounds by the fact that the former are more
steady state, although they may not be continuous.
   (y)   “Noise Control Officer” means a government employee who has received
noise enforcement training.  The employee must be acting within his or her
designated jurisdiction and must be authorized to issue a summons in order to

   (a)   Continuous Sound.
      (1)   No person shall cause, suffer, allow, or permit the operation of
any source of sound on any source property listed in Section
532.02  in such a manner as to create a sound level that exceeds the sound
level limits listed in Table I, as measured at any location at or within the
property line of the receptor property. Sound pressure levels in excess of
those established in Table I shall constitute prima facie evidence that such
sound is in violation of this chapter.
TABLE 1
PERMISSIBLE SOUND LEVEL LIMITS
Equivalent-continuous sound level (average sound level)
 
                   Daytime Limit        Nighttime Limits
                   (Dawn to 10:00 p.m.) (10:00 p.m. to Dawn)
Receiving Property Leq. dB(A)           Leq. dB (A)
Residential        60                   55
Commercial         65                   65
Industrial         70                   70
 
      (1)   These limits may not be exceeded by any single incident
representing the normal, usual operation of the sound source, during any
sampling interval, the duration of which shall be no less than five minutes,
within any one-hour period. For example, if a motor fan belt were to squeal for
twenty seconds upon starting, but the sound was emitted with regularity from
this source, a single measurement shall be sufficient.
      (2)   Nothing in this section supersedes the requirements of employers to
comply with the Occupational Noise Exposure Standard of the Occupational Safety
and Health Administration (29 CFR Part 1910.95).
   (b)   Intermittant Sound.
      (1)   Between dawn and 10:00 p.m. impulsive sounds, which occur less than
ten times in an hour, shall not equal or exceed 20 decibels above the
permissible sound level limits in Table I. Impulsive sound which repeats ten or
more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound level limits in
Table I.
      (2)   Between the hours of 10:00 p.m. and dawn., impulsive sounds which
occur less than four times in an hour shall not equal or exceed 20 decibels
above the permissible sound level limits in Table I. Impulsive sound which
repeats four or more times in any hour shall not exceed the permissible sound
level limits in Table I.
   (c)   Steady Pure Tones. If the sound source under investigation is a
mechanical device, and is in the investigating Noise Administrator’s opinion
emitting a sound with a steady pure tonal quality, the permissible sound level
limits in Table I shall be reduced by 5 dB(A). The sound emissions must be
comprised of a single frequency or a narrow cluster of frequencies, which may
be referred to as a whine, hum or buzz. The measured sound levels of such a
source will typically not fluctuate by more than plus or minus 3 dB. Such sound
sources include, but are not limited to, heating, ventilating or air-
conditioning units; refrigeration units; and transformers. 
(Ord. 07-01.  Passed  2-12-07.)
   532.06  PROCEDURES FOR THE DETERMINATION OF SOUND LEVELS.
   (a)   When applicable, the sound level shall be measured with an integrating
sound level meter. The sound level meter and field calibrator must be re-
certified within the previous 12-months at a laboratory approved by the
Administrator. A field check of meter calibration and batteries must be
conducted before and after every set of measurements.
   (b)   The effects of residual sound levels are to be considered and
minimized, if possible. 
(Ord. 07-01.  Passed 2-12-07.)
   532.07  INSPECTIONS.

chapter, the Noise Administrator or any police officer in addition to any other
authority, upon presentation of proper credentials, shall enter and inspect any
dwelling, multi-family dwelling, building, structure, or premises within the
Village as may be necessary to enforce the provisions of this Chapter including
taking sound level measurements and tests. If permission is refused or is
otherwise unobtainable, a search warranty shall be obtained to permit entry and
access for the purpose of inspecting, testing, and measuring sound levels.
   (b)   It shall be unlawful for any person to refuse to allow or permit the
Noise Administrator or any police officer free access to any premises when such
person is acting in compliance with a search warrant.
   (c)   Misrepresentation to avoid compliance. It shall be unlawful for any
person to misrepresent or give any false information or in any way attempt to
deceive the Noise Administrator or any police officer in order to avoid
compliance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 07-01.  Passed 2-12-07.)

application with the Municipal Clerk on forms provided by the Noise Control
Administrator.  The application shall contain information, which demonstrated
that bringing the source of sound, or activity for which the waiver is sought
into compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable hardship on
the applicant, on the community, or on other persons. Notice of an application
for a waiver shall be given by the Municipal Clerk by publication in a
newspaper of general circulation in the Village. The Noise Administrator shall
not approve an application less than 10 days after the public notice is

affected by allowance of the waiver may file a statement with the Noise Control
Administrator containing any information to support his/her claim.
   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Noise
Control Administrator shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the
community, and other persons of not granting the waiver against the adverse
impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse
impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the
waiver. Applicants for waiver and persons contesting waiver may be required to
submit any information the Noise Administrator may reasonably require. In
granting or denying an application, the Noise Administrator shall place for
public view in the Municipal Clerk’s Office a copy of the decision and the
reasons for denying or granting the wavier.
   (d)   A wavier shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all
necessary conditions, including a time limit on the activity. Any regulations
of time, place and manner shall be independent of the content of the speech.
The waiver shall not become effective until all conditions are agreed to by the
applicant. Noncompliance with any conditions of the waiver shall terminate it
and subject the person holding it to those provisions of this chapter
regulating the source of the sound or activity for which the waiver was
granted.
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in the waiver or
for modifications of other substantial conditions shall be treated like an
application for an initial waiver.

Village Council defining the procedures to be followed in applying for a waiver
and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to grant a waiver.
   (g)   The decision of the Noise Administrator may be appealed by the person
denied the waiver or by any person claiming to be adversely affected by
allowance of the waiver. Such appeal shall be made to the Planning Commission,
with a subsequent appeal to Council.

   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.

   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to

primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.

      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as

   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the

   545.02  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN THEFT OFFENSE.
   (a)   If more than one item of property or service is involved in a theft
offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value is the aggregate value of all property or services
involved in the offense.

545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,

545.08 ,
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20  involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, is
committed by the offender in the offender's same employment, capacity, or
relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be tried as a single
offense.  When a series of offenses under Section
545.05 , or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of,
conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Sections
545.05  or
545.15  involving a victim who is an active duty service member or spouse of an
active duty service member is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses shall be
tried as a single offense.  The value of the property or services involved in
the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the value is the
aggregate value of all property and services involved in all offenses in the
series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Section
545.05  that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims,
all of the offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If an offender is being
tried for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Section
545.05 ,
545.06  or
545.08 , Section
545.10 (b)(1) or (2), or Section
545.15  or
545.20 , whether committed against one victim or more than one victim,
involving a victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, pursuant to a
scheme or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single

duty service member pursuant to a scheme or course of conduct, all of those
offenses may be tried as a single offense.  If the offenses are tried as a
single offense, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose
of determining the value is the aggregate value of all property and services
involved in all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   In prosecuting a single offense under subsection (b)(1) or (2), it
is not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series. 
Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the offender, within a given
span of time, committed one or more theft offenses in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in subsection (b)
(1) of this section or that involve a common course of conduct to defraud
multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

the offender has previously been convicted of a theft offense, the provisions

or for a purpose defined in Ohio R.C. 5503.34 that was the basis of the
violation any law enforcement officer involved with the stop or the employee of

license shall not be suspended pursuant to division (A)(2) of Ohio R.C.
2923.128.  A violation of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section is a
misdemeanor of the first degree or, if the offender previously has been

this section, a felony and shall be prosecuted under appropriate State law.  In
addition to any other penalty or sanction imposed for a misdemeanor violation
of subsection (b)(3) or (4) of this section, the offender’s concealed handgun

   (g)   If a law enforcement officer stops a motor vehicle for a traffic stop
or any other purpose, if any person in the motor vehicle surrenders a firearm
to the officer, either voluntarily or pursuant to a request or demand of the
officer, and if the officer does not charge the person with a violation of this
section or arrest the person for any offense, the person is not otherwise
prohibited by law from possessing the firearm, and the firearm is not
contraband, the officer shall return the firearm to the person at the
termination of the stop.  If a court orders a law enforcement officer to return

in separate compartments within the package, box, or case, or, if they are in
the same compartment, the magazine or speed loader is contained within a
separate enclosure in that compartment that does not contain the firearm and
that closes using a snap, button, buckle, zipper, hook and loop closing
mechanism, or other fastener that must be opened to access the contents or the
firearm is contained within a separate enclosure of that nature in that
compartment that does not contain the magazine or speed loader;
               b.   A pocket or other enclosure on the person of the person in

with this section, to grant a waiver.
   (b)   Any person seeking a waiver pursuant to this section shall file an
application with the Municipal Clerk on forms provided by the Noise Control
Administrator.  The application shall contain information, which demonstrates
that bringing the source of vibration, or activity for which the waiver is
sought into compliance with this chapter would constitute an unreasonable
hardship on the applicant, on the community, or on other persons. Notice of an
application for a waiver shall be given by the Municipal Clerk by publication
in a newspaper of general circulation in the Village. The Noise Control
Administrator shall not approve an application less than ten days after the
public notice is published. Each application shall be accompanied by a fee as
set forth by the Village Council to cover expenses resulting from the
publication and administration of the waiver application. Any person who claims
to be adversely affected by allowance of the waiver may file a statement with
the Noise Control Administrator containing any information to support his/her
claim.
   (c)   In determining whether to grant or deny the application, the Noise
Control Administrator shall balance the hardship to the applicant, the
community, and other persons of not granting the waiver against the adverse
impact on the health, safety and welfare of persons affected, the adverse
impact on property affected, and any other adverse impacts of granting the
waiver. Applicants for waiver and persons contesting waiver may be required to
submit any information the Noise Control Administrator may reasonably require.
In granting or denying an application, the Noise Control Administrator shall
place for public view in the Municipal Clerk’s Office a copy of the decision
and the reasons for denying or granting the wavier.
   (d)   A wavier shall be granted by notice to the applicant containing all
necessary conditions, including a time limit on the activity.  Necessary
conditions may include regulations of time, place and manner of the activity
creating the vibrations. The waiver shall not become effective until the
applicant agrees to all conditions.  Noncompliance with any conditions of the
waiver shall terminate it and subject the person holding it to those provisions
of this chapter regulating the source of the vibration or activity for which
the waiver was granted.
   (e)   Application for extension of time limits specified in the waiver or
for modifications of other substantial conditions shall be treated like an
application for an initial waiver.
   (f)   The Noise Control Administrator may issue guidelines approved by
resolution of the Village Council defining the procedures to be followed in
applying for a waiver and the criteria to be considered in deciding whether to
grant a waiver.
   (g)   The decision of the Noise Control Administrator may be appealed by the
person denied the waiver or by any person claiming to be adversely affected by
allowance of the waiver. Such appeal shall be made to the Planning Commission,
with a subsequent appeal to Council. 
(Ord. 07-07.  Passed 4-9-07.)
   559.99  PENALTY.
   (a)   Criminal Prosecution.
      (1)   Any Noise Control Administrator may issue a warning giving notice
of a violation of this chapter.
      (2)   Any police officer in conjunction with a Noise Control
Administrator, or any two police officers together, may issue an order
requiring the immediate abatement of a source of vibration alleged to be in
violation of this chapter.
      (3)   A first violation of any other section of this chapter shall be a
minor misdemeanor.
      (4)   Any subsequent violations of any other section of this chapter
shall each be a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Each day such violation is
committed or permitted to continue shall be considered a separate offense.
   (b)   Civil Action.  An action for injunctive relief may be brought by the
Village in a court of competent jurisdiction against any person who has
violated any provision of this chapter. Every day during which the violation
continues shall constitute an additional, separate and distinct offense.
      (1)   Any person who violates any of the provisions of this chapter may
be liable for the actual attorneys’ fees, expenses (including expert witness
fees), and costs incurred in establishing the violation in a civil action.
   (c)   Other Remedies.  The rights and remedies provided by this chapter are
in addition to any other rights and remedies provided by law.

   The Street Commissioner of the Village is hereby charged with the duty of
overseeing all sidewalks within the Village limits, which shall specifically
include inspection of existing sidewalks and reporting any necessary repairs to
Council, supervision of repairs or construction of new sidewalks and
establishing detailed specifications for sidewalks and the location of new
sidewalks. In establishing specifications for and location of specific
sidewalks, for purposes of repair or new construction, the Commissioner shall
attempt, insofar as possible, to establish uniformity throughout the Village,
seeking maximum utility with a minimum of damage to the property and trees,
shrubbery, fences, etc. already located thereon. Unless special circumstances
justify different specifications in constructing new sidewalks, the
specifications shall call for concrete sidewalks of a minimum width of four
feet and a minimum depth of four inches, upon sound footing. In locating
sidewalks, the Commissioner shall not be limited to Village property or street
rights of way, but may specify locations upon private property.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.02  REPAIRS.
   The Street Commissioner shall report all necessary repairs of specific
sidewalks, together with his recommendation thereon, to Council. Council may
provide for the repair and restoration thereof or any portion thereof at the
expense of the Village, or may direct the owner of the abutting property to
repair the same, according to the detailed specifications of the Commissioner.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.03  NEW CONSTRUCTION.
   Council may designate by specific resolutions, from time to time, specific
areas within the Village where new sidewalks shall be constructed, pursuant to
the detailed specifications of the Street Commissioner. The resolution may
provide that the cost shall be borne by the Village in which case the
resolution shall call for proper advertisement for bids as provided by law or
the resolution may provide that the cost thereof be assessed against the owners
of the property bounding or abutting such sidewalks.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.04  PRIVATE CONSTRUCTION; NOTICE; ASSESSMENT.
   If Council elects to assess the cost of the repair or construction of
sidewalks, it shall adopt a resolution specifying the particular sidewalks to
be repaired or constructed. Appropriate written notice of the resolution shall
thereupon be served upon the owner or agent of each parcel of land abutting on
the sidewalks by the Chief of Police or a deputy, as provided in Ohio R.C.
729.02 and 729.03. If the owner of a parcel is a nonresident, notice of the
resolution shall be given by publication, as provided by Ohio R.C. 729.03. The
notice shall state, if the indicated repairs are not made within thirty days or
the indicated construction is not completed within sixty days, or within a
reasonable extension thereof expressly granted by the Street Commissioner, that
the Village shall perform or contract for such repair and construction on
behalf of the owner and shall report and assess the cost or materials furnished
by the Village, or both. However, the cost of sidewalks abutting publicly owned
property and the costs of crossover or intersection sidewalks shall be paid by
the Village and no part thereof so assessed. Council may provide for the
construction of sidewalks on only one side of a street or alley and it may
assess the cost thereof, equally or otherwise, upon the owners of the property
abutting on both sides of such street or alley. The assessed cost shall
constitute a lien on such property from the date the amount thereof is reported
to the owner and, if not paid to the Clerk-Treasurer within ten days
thereafter, the Clerk-Treasurer shall certify it, to the County Auditor, who
shall place it upon the tax duplicate and collect the same as provided by law.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.05  SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS.
   Nothing herein contained shall be construed as preventing Council from
providing for the repair and/or construction of sidewalks, and recovering the
cost thereof by special assessments, as provided by Ohio R.C. 727.01 et seq.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.06  BUILDING OR FENCE ENCROACHMENT.
   No person shall obstruct any street, alley, sidewalk or other public way by
erecting thereon any fence or building, or permitting any fence or building to
remain thereon. Each day that any such fence or building is permitted to remain
upon such public way shall be deemed a separate offense.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.07  MATERIALS ON STREET OR SIDEWALK.
   No person shall encumber any street or sidewalk or, being the owner,
occupant or person having the care of any building or lot of land bordering on
any street or sidewalk, shall permit the same to be encumbered with barrels,
boxes, cans, articles, vegetation, obstructions or substances of any kind so as
to interfere with the free and unobstructed use thereof.
(Ord. 1121. Passed 3-5-84.)
   901.99  PENALTY.

      (Ord. 97-23.  Passed 8-11-97.)
   925.03  PERMITTED INDUSTRIAL WASTES.
   The Village shall receive and treat all industrial wastes except as
stipulated under Section
925.02.  In order to provide for equality among the users of the sewerage
system, the acceptable wastes shall be evaluated in terms of both quantity and
quality.
   (a)   Quantity.  The quantity shall be measured volume of waste water
expressed in gallons or cubic feet.  All new and existing industrial waste
connections shall be provided by the owner and the sampling and measuring
facilities at the discretion of the Village or the owner shall provide derived
volumes of wastes in a manner which reflects accuracy satisfactory to the
Village.
   (b)   Quality; Surcharge.
      (1)   When either or both the total suspended solids and B.O.D. of
acceptable wastes or waste water exceeds the values ascribed to normal waste
waters, the excess concentration of either or both, as the case may be, shall
be evaluated volumetrically in terms of normal waste and be subject to
surcharge on the derived volume in accordance with the following formula:
Sv= (Sw-2800) x 0.90 x F x 133.690 + (Bw-1700) x 0.90 x F x 133.690
                        2900                                          1700
          which reduced to its simplest form is:
               Sv = F (Sw-2800) 43 + (B2-1700) 71
         Sv:   The derived volume of wastes subject to surcharge expressed in
cubic feet.
         Sw:   The pounds per million gallons in the waste as discharged
denoting suspended solids.
         Bw:   The pounds per million gallons of the waste as discharged
denoting B.O.D.
         0.90:   Factor allowance for ninety percent degree of removals.
         F:   The flow expressed in millions of gallons of the wastes as
discharged.
         133,690:   Factor to convert millions of gallons to an equivalent in
cubic feet.
      (2)   The equivalent volume of normal waste water as derived from the
excess above normal strength of any water and wastes shall be subject to a
surcharge for the volume of equivalent normal waste water as computed from the
formula, at a flat rate for each 100 cubic feet, as previously computed.  This
rate shall be the prevailing minimum rate on a volume basis, as provided for in
Ordinance No. 1068.
      (3)   The surcharge is in addition to the present fixed charges for
normal wastewater.
   (c)   Pretreatment.  The Village shall have the right to require
pretreatment of waste when in its opinion the same is necessary to meet permit
requirements and to protect the integrity of its system.  (Ord. 97-23.  Passed
8-11-97.)
   (d)   Grease, Sand and Oil Traps.  Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall
be provided when in the opinion of the Utilities Director or Wastewater
Treatment Plant Superintendent, they are necessary for proper handling of
liquid wastes containing floating grease or oil in excessive amounts, or any
flammable wastes, sand or other harmful ingredients.  (A trap for the
interception of grease, oil and mud shall be provided on a connection from a
restaurant, club, hotel, residential dwelling consisting of more than 4 units,
food, or bakery establishment, commercial or institutional kitchen, public
garage, automobile washing station, slaughter or packing house.)  The Utilities
Board may grant exemption from the street application of this provision upon
application and for good cause shown.
   All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the Utilities
Director or Wastewater Treatment Plant Superintendent, and shall be located as
to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspections.  All
interceptors shall be constructed of impervious materials capable of
withstanding abrupt and extreme changes in temperature.  They shall be of
substantial construction; watertight and equipped with easily removable covers
which when bolted in place shall be gas tight and watertight.  Where installed,
all grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be maintained by the owner(s) at
the owner(s)’ expense, in continuous efficient operation at all times.
   In the maintenance of these interceptors, the owner(s) shall be responsible
for the proper removal and disposal of appropriate means of the captured
material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal, which
shall be subject to review by the Utilities Director or Wastewater Treatment
Plant Superintendent.  Any removal and hauling of the collected material must
be performed by currently licensed waste disposal firms unless approved
otherwise by the Utilities Director or Wastewater Treatment Plant
Superintendent.
      Where the potential for the discharge of flammable substances exists, the
user may be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas
detention meter. 
(Ord.  03-13.  Passed 8-11-03.)
   (e)   Amalgam Management at Dental Offices. 
      (1)   This section applies to any dental office that places or removes
amalgam.  If work in a dental office is limited to work that does not involve
placing or removing amalgam, such as orthodontics, periodontics, oral and
maxillo-facial surgery, endodontics or prosthodontics, then this section does
not apply.
      (2)   All dental offices shall implement best management practices for
amalgam as established by the American Dental Association by July 5, 2005. 
(Ord. 04-27.  Passed 12-13-04.)
   (f)   Control Manhole.  If so ordered by the Village, the owner or operator
of any premises or facility discharging industrial wastes into the system shall
install at his own cost and expense, suitable monitoring equipment to
facilitate the accurate observation, sampling and measurement of wastes. Such
equipment shall be maintained in proper working order and kept safe and
accessible at all times.
      The monitoring equipment shall be located and maintained on the
industrial user’s premises outside of the building.  When such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, the Village may allow such
a facility to be constructed in the public right of way, and located so that it
will not be obstructed by public utilities, landscaping or parked vehicles.
   (g)   Industrial Permit Reports.  All industrial users who discharge or
propose to discharge wastewater to the wastewater treatment system shall
maintain such records of production and related factors, effluent flow, and
pollutant amounts and concentrations of such pollutants that are necessary to
demonstrate compliance with the requirements of this chapter and any applicable
State or Federal pretreatment standards or requirements.
      Such records shall be made available upon request by the Village.  All
such records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made
available to officials of the EPA upon demand.
   (h)   Notification Procedures.  Each industrial user shall provide
protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes
regulated by this chapter.  Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
prohibited materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner’s or
operator’s own cost and expense.  Detailed plans showing facilities and
operating procedures to provide this protection shall be submitted to the
Village for review, and shall be approved by the Village before construction of
the facility.  Review and approval of such plans and operating procedures shall
not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to modify his facility
as necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.
      If, for any reason, a facility does not comply with or will be unable to
comply with any prohibition or limitations in this chapter, the facility
responsible for such discharge shall immediately notify the Village so that
corrective action may be taken to protect the treatment system.  In addition, a
written report addressed to the Village detailing the date, time and cause of
the accidental discharge; the quantity and characteristics of the discharge;
and the corrective action taken to prevent future discharges, shall be filed by
the responsible industrial facility within five days of the occurrence of the
noncomplying discharge.
   (i)   Annual Audit/Review and Notification.  The sewer service charge and
user charges shall be reviewed annually by the Village in order to determine
whether or not they are sufficient to defray the fixed charges, amortization
costs, and annual cost of OM&R of the sewerage system.  If the difference
between the total annual revenue derived and total annual cost is sufficient to
justify an increase or decrease in the sewer service charge or user charges,
the Village will adjust the rates as required.  The purpose of the annual
review is also to maintain a proportional user charge.
      Each user to be notified at least annually, in conjunction with a regular
bill, of the rate and that portion of the sewer service charge which is
attributable to OM&R costs of wastewater treatment services.
      (Ord. 97-23.  Passed 8-11-97.)
   925.04  RIGHT OF ENTRY.

   925.05  REGISTRATION OF WATER WELLS.
   (a)   In the event a lot, parcel of land, building or premises discharges
sewage, industrial waste, water or other liquids, either directly or indirectly
into the Village sewerage system, or which ultimately enters the sewerage
system, is supplied either in whole or in part with water from wells or any
source other than the Village Water Department, then such wells or other source
of supply shall be registered with the Utilities Board, on or before April 1,
1969, and if the water from such wells or other source of supply is not
measured by a water meter acceptable to the Board, then in such case, the owner
or other interested party, at his own expense, shall install and maintain water
meters satisfactory to the Board on all supplies, and the quantity of water
used to determine the sewerage service charge shall be the quantity as measured
by the single meter or the sum of the quantities measured by the several
meters.
   (b)   Where it can be shown to the satisfaction of the Utilities Board that
a portion of the water as measured by the water meter or meters does not enter
the sewerage system, then the Board may require or shall permit the
installation of additional meters at the owner’s or other interested party’s
expense in such manner as to measure the quantity of water actually entering
the sewerage system from the premises of such owner or other interested party,
and the quantity of water used to determine the sewerage system charge shall be
the quantity of water actually entering the sewerage system so determined.
   (c)   If, under this section, the Utilities Board finds that it is not
practicable to measure such waste by meters, it shall determine the waste in
any manner or method as it may find practicable, in order to arrive at the
percentage of metered water entering the sewerage system and the quantity of
water used to determine the sewerage service charge shall be that percentage. 
(Ord. 97-23.  Passed 8-11-97.)
   925.06  WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT.

   929.01  WATER TAP-IN CHARGES.
   (EDITOR’S NOTE: Pursuant to Ordinance 1281, passed April 22, 1991, Council
has adopted additional tap-in charges for the Eastowne Drive Trunk Water Main
Project.  Copies of the ordinance are on file at City Hall.)
   (a)   All water connections from individual properties to the main lines of
the Village of Ottawa, Ohio shall be made by the employees of the Village upon
payment of the following charges:
 
(1) 3/4" water line            $700.00
(2) 1" water line                850.00
(3) 1.5" water line and larger This charge is to be established by negotiation
                               between the owner and Council.
   (b)   Single family, dual family, three family and four family dwellings
shall have separate taps for each dwelling.  New and replacement meters larger
than the standard residential meter, 5/8", shall be at the cost of the owner. 
The owner shall request and purchase the meter through the Village in order for
standard specifications to be met.
   (c)   Taps made by Village personnel on service lines not owned by the
Village of Ottawa shall be charged as listed above plus twenty percent (20%) or
the actual cost of installation plus twenty percent (20%) whichever is higher. 
In certain circumstances, taps on service lines not owned by the Village of
Ottawa may be performed by qualified individuals as approved and inspected by
the Village of Ottawa at a cost of four hundred and twenty dollars ($420.00).
      (Ord. 05-21.  Passed 10-10-05.)
   929.02  METER INSTALLATION CHARGE.
   (a)   In addition to the charges in Section
929.01, the property owner shall also pay to the Village the actual cost to the
Village of the water meter to be installed for such property, and all of the
charges shall be paid by the owner to the Clerk of the Village in advance of
the connection to the Village water system.  The Village shall be responsible
for bringing the water to the owner's property line. 
 
   (b)   The Village may waive the installation charge for replacement of water
meters with radio read meters.  Except as set forth below, the radio read
meters will be installed in businesses, apartment complexes and single family
residences by Village of Ottawa personnel, free of installation charge, so long
as there is sufficient accessibility to the existing meter and provided the
plumbing condition of the current meter is correct.  Incorrect installation of
the existing meter, poor plumbing conditions, or the use of insufficient
materials will not be repaired by Village of Ottawa personnel.  Meters located
in a crawlspace or any other area not readily accessible to Village of Ottawa
personnel, as determined by Village of Ottawa personnel, will need to be
replaced by the property owners at their expense.  The Village personnel may
decline to install meters for good cause, which good cause is within the
discretion of Village personnel.  The Village will cooperate with the property
owner to provide the proper meter in order to allow the property owner to
install the meter at their convenience.
(Ord. 12-16.  Passed 10-8-12.)
   (c)    In the event of the existence of a condition set forth in the
preceding paragraph, or in the event a property owner would prefer to install
the meter, the Village of Ottawa will issue a radio read meter to the property
owner.  The date of the receipt by the property owner of the radio read meter
will be the "issue date".  The property owner will have 30 days from the issue
date to install the meter.  The Village of Ottawa personnel will perform an
inspection to verify the meter has been properly installed and will collect the
old meter and submit the final reading of the old meter at that time.  A
penalty fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month will be charged to
property owners who have not installed the new meter within 30 days of the
issue date, unless a special waiver is approved by Council due to extenuating
circumstances.  Any penalty fee which is not paid within 30 days of demand may
be assessed to property taxes.  (Ord. 13-17.  Passed 8- 26-13.)
   929.03  SEWER TAP-IN CHARGES.
   The following tap-in charges shall be levied on property owners connecting

unit shall be a tap-in charge of six hundred dollars ($600.00) for the area
comprising such trailer court, apartments, motels, hotels and any other
multifamily units, plus the additional tap-in charge of two hundred dollars
($200.00) for each trailer lot, apartment, motel room, hotel room or family
unit over one in number.  Said tap-in charge shall be paid in advance of the
issuance of the tap-in permit, except in the case of trailer courts in which
event the additional charge of two hundred dollars ($200.00) shall be paid for
each lot upon its first use.
   (d)   Any applications for water or sanitary sewer tap of a type not
specifically covered by this section, the charge therefor shall be negotiated
between the owner and Council which shall when evidenced by ordinance of
Council be final and binding upon the owner.

structure to the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project without first paying the
charges provided for in Chapter
925 and Section
929.03 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Ottawa and the additional
charges determined in accordance with the provisions of this Section.  For
purposes of this Section, the term “Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project” shall
means those sanitary sewer improvements which are the subject of an agreement
between the Village and the County of Putnam, Ohio authorized by Ordinance No.
05- 08 of this Village passed on April 25, 2005.
(Ord. 05-10.  Passed 5-9-05.)
   (b)   Where a connection is to be made to the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer
Project, the potential user thereof shall pay, prior to making such connection,
in addition to the charges specified in Chapter
925 and Section
929.03 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Ottawa, a one-time, up-
front connection charge initially equal to $9,025.69 per equivalent dwelling
unit (“EDU”) times the number of EDUs as determined in paragraph (c) of this
Section. 
(Ord. 06-20.  Passed 10-9-06.)
   (c)   For purposes of determining the connection charge under paragraph (b)
of this section, an EDU is hereby determined to be equivalent to a portion of
the capacity of the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project to serve a single family
dwelling.  The number of EDUs shall be determined by the Director of Municipal
Service based upon the following guidelines: (i) lots with only a single family
dwelling thereon shall be assigned one EDU; (ii) lots with a double house or
duplex thereon, or a single family dwelling thereon with only one additional
rental unit or one additional separate living unit therein, or a single family
dwelling thereon and a structure constituting only one additional rental unit
or one additional separate living unit thereon, such as a garage apartment,
shall be assigned two EDUs; (iii) lots which contain a dwelling but do not fall
within categories (i) or (ii) above, or lots which contain structures which are
used other than as dwellings, such as for agricultural, commercial, industrial,
governmental, church, social or community purposes, shall be assigned such
number of EDUs as determined by a consulting engineer to the Village based on
customary engineering principals and practices with respect thereto; and (iv) a
connection to the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project which is other than a
service connection for a single lot, such as a sewer line extension to serve
lots which cannot practicably or economically be served by direct individual
lot service connections to the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project, shall be
assigned such number of EDUs as determined at that time either (A) by a
consulting engineer to the Village based on the standards set forth above and
taking into account the relative value and benefit of the Pohl Road Sanitary
Sewer Project to such lots to be served by that connection by taking into
account such factors as that consulting engineer may determine to be reasonable
and appropriate under the circumstances or (B) by the then Village Council.
(Ord. 05-10.  Passed 5-9-05.)
   (d)   In lieu of payment of the one-time, up-front connection charge
provided in paragraph (b) of this Section a potential user with a direct
individual lot service connection to the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project may
pay any portion thereof and may enter into a written contract with the Village,
in form and substance satisfactory to, and approved by, the Law Director of the
Village, agreeing, on behalf of that user and any successors, assigns and
future users of that connection, to pay the unpaid balance of that connection
charge in two hundred forty consecutive monthly installments to be calculated
by amortizing the unpaid balance of that connection charge on a monthly basis
over a twenty year period and at an interest rate of 6% per year, which results
in a monthly amortization factor of 0.007165.  The monthly installment due
shall be determined by multiplying the unpaid balance of that connection charge
by that monthly amortization factor of 0.007165.  Each such monthly installment
shall be billed monthly to the user of that connection and may be included in
any other monthly bill rendered to that user by the Village.  Any user who is
paying the unpaid balance of that connection charge on a monthly installment
basis may at any time elect to pay in whole (except owners who are responsible
for multiple EDU’s who shall be permitted to pay less than the balance due in
owing, so long as the partial payment is not less than $2,000.00) the remaining
unamortized principle balance of that connection charge as calculated by the
Clerk-Treasurer, and upon such payment in full the monthly charge provided for
in this paragraph shall no longer be billed.
(Ord. 06-27.  Passed 12-18-06.)
   (e)   The connection charge per EDU  set forth in paragraph (b) of this
section shall be increased by an amount equal to 4% thereof on January 1, 2007
and on the first day of January each year thereafter, provided, however, that
the connection charge per EDU shall not be increased by the provisions of this
paragraph (e) beyond $18,000 per EDU.  The incremental charges as set forth in
this paragraph and the incremental charges on a monthly basis as set forth in
paragraph (d) hereof are intended to offset interest charges on obligations
incurred to pay, and interest earnings foregone on any funds utilized or to be
utilized by the Village to pay, the cost of the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer
Project.
   (f)   Any connection charges collected in monthly installments must be paid
in the manner and at the same time as required by Chapter
925 of the Codified Ordinances for monthly bills and the provisions of Section
925.13 shall apply in all respect to those installments as if the same were
sewer charges thereunder.  All moneys collected by the Village as connection
charge and installments thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section
shall be deposited and used as provided in Section
929.04 of the Codified Ordinances.
   (g)   The imposition of charges provided for in this section shall not
preclude the subsequent levy of special assessments against benefitted
properties to provide funds for the construction, replacement, rehabilitation
or other improvement of sanitary sewers required to provide sanitary service to
such properties, and the charges provided for in this section are in addition
to any other permits and charges required by law and by ordinance or regulation
of this Village.
   (h)   In the event any lot or land or building or other structure thereon is
connected to the Pohl Road Sanitary Sewer Project in violation of any of the
provisions of this section, and the owner, agent, lessee, tenant or occupant of
such lot or land fails or refuses to disconnect the same upon being directed to
do so by the Director of Municipal Service, the Director of Municipal Service
is hereby authorized to cause such lot or land to be disconnected from the Pohl
Road Sanitary Sewer Project, and the violator shall be liable to the Village
for the cost of making such disconnection.

   (a)   No person, corporation, public agency, partnership or association
whatsoever shall connect, or cause to be connected, any building or other
structure to the Pohl Road Waterline Project (i) unless authorized to do so
under the ordinances, rules and regulations of the Village of Ottawa and (ii)
without first paying the charges provided for in Chapter
921 and Sections
929.01 and
929.02 of the Codified Ordinances of the Village of Ottawa and the additional
charges determined in accordance with the provisions of this section.  For
purposes of this section, the term “Pohl Road Waterline Project” shall mean the
Pohl Road waterline project set forth in a connection fee study dated April 25,
2005 prepared by the consulting engineers to the Village.
(Ord. 05-12.  Passed 5-23-05.)
   (b)   Where a connection is to be made to the Pohl Road Waterline Project,

front connection charge initially equal to $7,021.61 per equivalent dwelling
unit (“EDU”) times the number of EDUs as determined in paragraph (c) of this
Section.
(Ord. 06-19.  Passed 10-9-06.)
   (c)   For purposes of determining the connection charge under paragraph (b)
of this section, an EDU is hereby determined to be equivalent to a portion of
the capacity of the Pohl Road Waterline Project to service a single family
dwelling.  The number of EDUs shall be determined by the Director of Municipal
Service based upon the following guidelines: (i) lots with only a single family
dwelling thereon shall be assigned one EDU; (ii) lots with a double house or
duplex thereon or a single family dwelling thereon with only one additional
rental unit or one additional separate living unit therein, or a single family
dwelling thereon and a structure constituting only one additional rental unit
or one additional separate living unit thereon, such as a garage apartment,

used other than as dwellings, such as for agricultural, commercial, industrial,
governmental, church, social or community purposes, shall be assigned such
number of EDUs as determined by a consulting engineer to the Village based on
customary engineering principals and practices with respect thereto; and (iv) a
connection to the Pohl Road Waterline Project which is other than a service
connection for a single lot, such as a waterline extension to serve lots which
cannot practicably or economically be served by direct individual lot service

of EDUs as determined at that time either (1) by a consulting engineer to the
Village based on the standards set forth above and taking into account the
relative value and benefit of the Pohl Road Waterline Project to such lots to
be served by that connection by taking into account such factors as that
consulting engineer may determine to be reasonable and appropriate under the
circumstances or (2) by the then Village Council.
(Ord. 05-12.  Passed 5-23-05.)
   (d)   In lieu of payment of the one-time, up-front connection charge
provided in paragraph (b) of this Section a potential user with a direct
individual lot service connection to the Pohl Road Waterline Project may pay
any portion thereof and may enter into a written contract with the Village, in
form and substance satisfactory to, and approved by, the Law Director of the
Village, agreeing, on behalf of that user and any successors, assigns and
future users of that connection, to pay the unpaid balance of that connection
charge in two hundred forty consecutive monthly installments to be calculated
by amortizing the unpaid balance of that connection charge on a monthly basis
over a twenty year period and at an interest rate of 6% per year, which results
in a monthly amortization factor of 0.007165.  The monthly installment due
shall be determined by multiplying the unpaid balance of that connection charge
by that monthly amortization factor of 0.007165.  Each such monthly installment
shall be billed monthly to the user of that connection and may be included in
any other monthly bill rendered to that user by the Village.  Any user who is
paying the unpaid balance of that connection charge on a monthly installment
basis may at any time elect to pay in whole (except owners who are responsible
for multiple EDU’s who shall be permitted to pay less than the balance due in
owing, so long as the partial payment is not less than $2,000.00) the remaining
unamortized principle balance of that connection charge as calculated by the
Clerk-Treasurer, and upon such payment in full the monthly charge provided for
in this paragraph shall no longer be billed.
(Ord. 06-26.  Passed 12-18-06.)

section shall be increased by an amount equal to 4% thereof on January 1, 2007
and on the first day of January each year thereafter, provided, however, that
the connection charge per EDU shall not be increased by the provisions of this
paragraph (e) beyond $15,000 per EDU.  The incremental charges as set forth in

utilized by the Village to pay, the cost of the Pohl Road Waterline Project.
   (f)   Any connection charges collected in monthly installments must be paid
in the manner and at the same time as required by Chapter
921 of the Codified Ordinances for monthly bills and the provisions of Section
921.01 shall apply in all respects to those installments as if the same were
water charges thereunder.  All moneys collected by the Village as connection
charges and installments thereof pursuant to the provisions of this section

   1111.01  LOCATION OF EXISTING STREETS, PARKS, ETC.
   It is suggested that the developer or his engineer, consult with the
Planning Commission or their agent while the plat is in skeleton form and
before the preliminary plat is prepared, to ascertain the location of present
streets, parks, playgrounds or other planned projects and related developments.
(Ord. 554. Passed 1-24-55.)
   1111.02  STREET AND BLOCK LAYOUT.
   In the laying out of a subdivision, the developer shall observe the
following general principles and requirements:
   (a)    Street and Block Layout.
      (1)    The subdivision layout shall conform to the tentative plat.
Whenever a tract to be subdivided embraces any part of a street, thoroughfare,
highway, boulevard or parkway so designed on such plan, such part of such
proposed public way shall be provided for by the developer in the location
indicated on the plan.
      (2)    The street layout shall be in conformity with a plan for the most
suitable advantageous development to the entire neighborhood.
         A.    As far as practicable, all proposed streets shall be continuous
in alignment with the existing planned or platted streets with which they are
to connect.
         B.    Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the
tract to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical
conditions, or unless in the opinion of the Planning Commission, such extension
is not necessary or desirable for the coordination of the layout of the
subdivision with the existing layout for the most advantageous future
development to adjacent tracts. Dead-end streets of reasonable length shall be
approved where necessary by topography or where in the opinion of the
Commission, they are appropriate for the type of development contemplated.
However, dead-end streets should be avoided.
         C.   Should there be along the adjoining boundary line of another
plat, a half-way street duly transferred or dedicated and recorded, the other
half width of such streets must be indicated on the proposed plat to make
streets the standard width.
         D.   Streets shall follow the contour as is practical.
         E.   Streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as
topography or other limiting factors of good design permit.
         F.   Alleys shall not be permitted in residential areas, but they
shall be provided in business sections.  Width to be determined by the
Commission.
         G.   Blocks shall have sufficient width to provide two tiers of lots
of appropriate depth.

together with a six foot “green space” easement adjacent to each side of the
additional right-of-way for the planting and maintenance of trees.
   (b)   Secondary streets shall have a minimum right-of-way of sixty feet
together with an additional six foot easement adjacent to each side of the
right-of-way for the planting and maintenance of trees.
   (c)   Dead-end streets shall terminate in a circular turnaround, having a
minimum right-of-way diameter of the right-of-way unless the Planning
Commission approves a “T” or “Y” shaped paved space in place of the required
turning circle.
   (d)   Easements for utilities shall be approved along rear and/or side lot
lines.  Such easements shall be at least ten feet wide.
   (e)   The “green space” set forth in Section
1111.03(a) and (b) shall be determined by measuring from the center of the
right-of-way to a point thirty feet from center on each side of the right-of-
way thence continuing a distance of six feet on each side as set forth in
Illustration “A”.  The “green space” easement shall not be considered part of
the right-of-way but shall be an easement in favor of the Village for the
limited purpose of planting, removal and maintenance of trees.
      (1)   Set backs required by Section
1161.03 shall be determined without regard to the “green space” created herein
by measuring from a point thirty feet from the center of the right-of-way as
the starting point for setbacks.

owners of the property, shall interpret the map in such a way as to carry out
the intent and purpose of this Zoning Code and map for the particular section

      (2)    Temporary permits. In undeveloped sections of the Village, the
Village Clerk may, with approval of the Planning Commission, grant temporary
and conditional permits for nonconforming uses, to terminate at a date
specified in the permit, which date shall not exceed two years from the date of
such permit, provided that such uses are important to the development of such
undeveloped sections and are not detrimental to the neighborhood. Such permits
may be renewed on reapplication to the Village Clerk.
      (3)    Extension of nonconforming use. The Village Clerk may, with
approval of the Planning Commission, grant a permit for the extension of
nonconforming uses upon a lot occupied by such use or on a lot adjoining or

ownership as the lot in question prior to and continuously since the time such
use became nonconforming, provided that:
         A.    In the case of a nonconforming use in the form of a building or
structure, such extension or extensions shall not exceed, in all, fifty percent
(50%) of the floor area of the existing building or structure devoted to such
nonconforming use, except as provided in subsection (c)(3) C. hereof.
         B.    In the case of the enlargement or an extension of a
nonconforming use not involving any building or structure, such extension or

extension shall not extend more than twenty-five feet beyond the district, or
to within 100 feet of the closest property line, whichever permits the greater
extension.
      (4)    Temporary uses for war purposes. In the event, in order to carry
out the use for war purposes of any building or premises, or by the direction
of the United States Government, it is shown to be necessary to use such
building or premises for a use prohibited by this Zoning Code, the Village
Clerk shall have the power to grant a temporary and conditional permit for such
use, in accordance with the following regulations:
         A.    The Village Clerk shall not exercise this power upon any
application unless he finds, upon the evidence produced before him, that there
is necessity for the proposed war purposes at the particular location of such
building or premises.
         B.    Any such permit shall terminate within two years or not later
than six months after the termination of the present National Emergency as
declared by the President of the United States.
         C.    In granting any such permit, the Village Clerk may permit such
repairs or temporary improvements or construction as he finds necessary for
such use.
         D.    Any application for any such permit shall be accompanied by a
written agreement of the owner and, if leased, also by the lessee of the
building or premises, that said improvements or constructions will be removed
on or before the termination of the permit as aforesaid, and that if such owner
or lessee fails to so remove the same, the Village may remove the same at the
cost of the owner or lessee and shall have a lien upon the property as security
for said agreement, the form of such agreement to be as may be specified by the
Village Solicitor.
         E.    No appeal for a continuance of such use shall be based upon said
repairs, improvements or constructions.
         F.    The Village Clerk may impose other conditions which he may deem
necessary or advisable to assure the temporary nature of the grant.
         G.    Upon the termination of the permit as hereinbefore provided, the
building or premises shall revert to its zoning status previous to the grant of
the permit.
      (5)    Control of manufacturing and other industrial uses. The Village
Clerk in authorizing any manufacturing or other industrial use in the I-
1 District, may require the installation, operation and maintenance, in
connection with the proposed use, of such devices and/or methods as may, in the
opinion of the Village Clerk, be reasonably required to prevent or reduce
fumes, gas, dust, smoke, odor, water-carried waste, noise, vibration or similar
nuisances, and may impose such conditions regarding the extent of open spaces
between it and surrounding properties as shall tend to prevent or reduce the
injury which might result from the proposed use to the surrounding properties
and neighborhood.
         (Ord. 1135. Passed. 11-26-84.)
   1125.04  VARIANCES.
   (a)    The Planning Commission shall have the power, upon application, to
authorize variances from the provisions and requirements of this Zoning Code
which shall not be contrary to the public interest or the intent and purpose of
this Zoning Code, but only where, owing to special conditions pertaining to a
specific piece of property the strict application of provisions or requirements
of this Zoning Code would cause undue or unnecessary hardship.
   (b)    No such variance shall be authorized by the Planning Commission
unless the Planning Commission finds that all the following facts and
conditions exist:
      (1)    Exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions applying
to the subject property that do not apply generally to other properties in the
same district or vicinity.
      (2)    The special circumstances or conditions do not result from actions
of the property owner or any of his predecessors in title.
      (3)    Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a
substantial property right of the applicant possessed by owners of other
properties in the same district or vicinity.
      (4)    The authorization of such variance shall not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property in the district or
vicinity in which the property is located.
   (c)    In modifying the literal interpretation and strict application of the
provisions of this Zoning Code and in authorizing a variance therefrom the
Planning Commission may impose such requirements and conditions regarding the
location, character and other features of the proposed uses or structures as he
may deem necessary in order to carry out the intent and purpose of this Zoning
Code, and to safeguard otherwise the public health, safety convenience and
general welfare.
   (d)    The Planning Commission shall have the power to establish definite
time limits within which any usage authorized by a variance shall be
commmenced. Any construction associated with a variance shall be governed by
the requirements of its building permit as stated in Section
1125.01(d). (Ord. 1135. Passed 11-26-84.)

   1127.01  HEARING OF APPEALS.
   All appeals from decisions made by the Village Clerk in administering the
zoning law shall be heard by the Planning Commission.
(Ord. 1135. Passed 11-26-84.)
   1127.02  APPEALS.
   (a)    Appeals to the Planning Commission may be taken by any person or by
any officer, board or commission of the Municipality affected by any grant or
refusal of a Certificate of Occupancy or by any other decision of the Village
Clerk, where such decision is based upon the requirements of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    The Planning Commission may, in conformity with the provisions of
this Zoning Code, reverse or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order,
requirement, decision, ruling or determination appealed from. (Ord. 1135.
Passed 11-26-84.)
   1127.03  PROCEDURE.
   (a)    Rules and Regulations. In exercising its powers in hearing appeals,
the Planning Commission shall adopt from time to time such general rules and
regulations as it may deem necessary to carry out its functions in hearing
appeals.
   (b)    Hearings.
      (1)    Any party adversely affected by any order or action of an
administrative decision by the Village Clerk, may appeal therefrom by filing a
notice of appeal with the Village Planning Commission, setting forth the order
or decision appealed from and the grounds of his appeal. Such notice of appeal
shall be filed within fifteen days after the issuance of the order or decision
made and issued by the Clerk, except in case of any order or decision made and
issued by the Village Clerk prior to the adoption of this chapter, in which
case fifteen days shall begin to run from the time of service of these rules
and regulations upon the parties affected by such administrative decision, by
publication in The Putnam County Sentinel.
      (2)    The filing of a notice of appeal shall not automatically operate
as a suspension of the order or decision of the Village Clerk. If it appears to
the Planning Commission that an unusual hardship to the appellant shall result
from the execution of the Village Clerk's order or decision pending
determination of the appeal, the Planning Commission may grant a suspension and
fix its terms.
      (3)    Within twenty days after the receipt of the notice of appeal from
an order or decision in any case the Village Clerk shall prepare and certify to
the Planning Commission a complete record of the proceedings in the case.
Failure of the Village Clerk to comply within the time allowed shall, upon
motion, cause the Planning Commission to enter a finding in favor of the party
adversely affected. Additional time, however, may be granted by the Planning
Commission, not to exceed ten days, when it is shown that the Clerk has made
substantial effort to comply. Such records shall be prepared and transcribed,
and the expense thereof shall be taxed as part of the cost on the appeal. The
appellant shall provide security for cost satisfactory to the Planning
Commission. Upon demand by any interested party, the Planning Commission shall
furnish, at the cost of the party requesting it, a copy of the stenographic
report of testimony offered, if any, and evidence at any hearing, and a copy of
the complete record.
      (4)    In the hearing of the appeal the Planning Commission is not
confined to the record as certified to it by the Clerk, but may hear any
evidence offered and consider the matter de novo.
      (5)    The Planning Commission shall conduct a hearing on such appeal and
shall give preference to such proceedings over all other matters, irrespective
of the time of filing of any other proceedings on the calendar of the Planning
Commission. The hearing before the Planning Commission shall determine the
rights of the parties in accordance with the Zoning Code and general laws of
the State of Ohio applicable to such appeal. At such hearing Council may be
heard on oral argument, briefs may be submitted, and evidence introduced, if
the Planning Commission has granted a request for presentation of additional
evidence.
      (6)    The Planning Commission may affirm the order or decision of the
Village Clerk complained of in the appeal, if it finds, upon evidence of the
entire record and such additional evidence as the Planning Commission has
admitted, that the order or decision is supported by reliable, probative, and
substantial evidence and is in accordance with law. In the absence of such
finding it may reverse, vacate or modify the order or make such other rulings
as are supported by reliable, probative, and substantial evidence and in
accordance with law. The decision of the Planning Commission shall be final and
conclusive unless reversed, vacated or modified on appeal to the Court of
Common Please. Such appeal may be taken either by the party or the Village
Clerk and shall proceed as in the case of appeals in civil actions as provided
by the Ohio Revised Code and the Ohio Rules of Civil Procedure.
      (7)    Hearings of the Planning Commission shall be public.
      (8)    Notice of hearings on each appeal shall be given by publication in
accordance with the Ohio Revised Code.
   (c)    Actions of the Planning Commission in Hearing Appeals.
      (1)    The Planning Commission may go into executive session for
discussion but not for vote on any case before it.
      (2)    The Planning Commission shall act by resolution, in which a
majority of members shall concur.
      (3)    Concise records and minutes of all official acts of the Planning
Commission in hearing appeals shall be maintained.
   (d)    Fees.
      (1)    With each application, the applicant shall pay a fee of not more
than twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
      (2)    Such fee shall be in addition to the payment of the regular
building permit fee and any other fee which thereafter may accrue, and no
portion of any fee shall be refunded whatever may be the outcome of the
application.

   1163.01  OFF-STREET LOADING SPACE.
   (a)    Required. In connection with every building or part thereof hereafter
erected, except dwellings, there shall be provided, on the same lot with such
building, off-street loading spaces or berths for uses which customarily
receive or distribute material or merchandise by vehicle, in accordance with
the requirements of subsection (f) hereof.
   (b)    Dimensions.
      (1)    Each off-street loading space in a B District shall be not less
than ten feet in width and twenty-five feet in length and, if a roofed berth,
not less than fourteen feet in height.
      (2)    Each off-street loading space in a I District shall be not less
than ten feet in width and fifty feet in length and, if a roofed berth, not
less than fifteen feet in height.
   (c)    Yard Occupancy. In any R District, such off-street loading space
shall be screened along any frontage abutting a street right-of-way line by a
screen fence. Screened fences shall be as permitted in Chapter
1169.
   (d)    Mixed Occupancies and Uses Not Specified. In the case of mixed uses,
the total requirement for off-street loading facilities shall be the sum of the
various uses computed separately. Where a use is not specifically mentioned,
the requirements for a use which is mentioned, and to which such use is
similar, shall apply. Off-street loading facilities for one use shall not be
considered as providing requirements for any other use, except as provided for
collective use.
   (e)    Collective Use. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent
the provision of off-street loading facilities for two or more buildings or
uses, provided that the total of such off-street loading spaces shall be not

(Ord. 1135. Passed 11-26-84.)
   1163.02  OFF-STREET PARKING SPACE.
   (a)    General.
      (1)    Required. In connection with every use, there shall be provided,
at the time any building or structure is erected, or at any time any use of
land is extended, off-street parking spaces for automobiles in accordance with
the requirements specified in Section
 1163.03.
      (2)    Minimum size. Each off-street parking space shall contain an area
of not less than 160 square feet exclusive of access drives and aisles, and
shall be of usable shape and condition.
      (3)    Access. In any district, there shall be no driveway entrance
hereafter constructed with, or altered to, a width of less than ten feet or
more than twenty-six feet at the curb or roadway, and no driveway shall
hereafter be constructed with, or widened to, a width greater at the property
line than at the curb or roadway; driveway entrances on any lot shall not
hereafter be constructed or widened to occupy more than an aggregate of twenty-
six feet of such lot’s frontage on the same street, and on any lot which has or
shall have more than one driveway entrance, from all abutting streets combined,
no such entrance or part thereof shall hereafter be provided within thirty feet
from the adjacent side line of the nearest such entrance on the same lot.
      (4)    Type. Parking space for all types of uses may be provided either
in garages or parking areas conforming to the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)    Location of Parking Facilities. Except as otherwise provided in the
applicable district use regulation, required off-street parking facilities
shall be located on the same lot as the principal building or on a lot within
500 feet thereof. The distance specified herein and the distances specified in
the district use regulations shall be measured from the nearest point of the
parking facility to the nearest point of the lot occupied by the building or
use that such facility is required to serve.
   (c)    Units of Measurement. For the purposes of determining off-street
parking requirements, the following units of measurement shall apply:
      (1)    Floor area. In the case of use, where floor area is the unit for
determining the required number of off-street parking spaces, such unit shall
mean the gross floor area, except that such floor area need not include any
floor area used for parking within the principal building and need not include
any area used for incidental service storage, installations of mechanical
equipment, penthouses, ventilators, and heating systems and similar uses.
      (2)    Hospital bassinets. In hospitals, bassinets shall not be counted
as beds.
      (3)    Places of public assembly.
         A.    Benches. In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and other places
of assembly in which those in attendance occupy benches, pews or other similar
seating facilities, each eighteen inches of such seating facilities shall be
counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the off-street parking
requirements of this Zoning Code.
         B.    Fixed seats and assembly area. In cases where a place of
assembly has both fixed seats and open assembly area, requirements shall be
computed separately for each type and added together.
      (4)    Fractions. When units of measurement determining the number of
required parking spaces result in requirement of a fractional space, any
fraction up to and including one-half shall be disregarded and fractions of
over one-half shall require one parking space.
   (d)    (1)    Additions and Enlargements. Whenever any enlargement of
building or extension of land use results in an increase in the number of units
used to measure required off-street parking spaces, and such alteration or
change creates a need for an increase of more than ten percent (10%) in the
number of required off-street parking spaces, additional off-street parking
shall be provided on the basis of the increase in the number of such units of
measurement, provided, however, that in case a change or increase in use
creates a need for an increase of less than five off-street parking spaces, no
additional parking facilities shall be required.
      (2)    Exceptions. In the case of additional dwelling units created by
conversion of an existing dwelling one off-street parking space shall be
required for each additional dwelling unit so created.
   (e)    Mixed Occupancies and Uses Not Specified. In the case of mixed use,
the total requirements for off-street parking facilities shall be the sum of
the requirements for the various uses computed separately. Where a use is not
specifically mentioned, the requirements for a use which is so mentioned and to
which said use is similar shall apply. Off-street parking facilities for one
use shall not be considered as providing requirements for any other use, except
as specified for joint use.
   (f)    Collective Provision. Where permitted by the applicable district use
regulations, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent provision of
collective off-street parking facilities for two or more buildings or uses. In
cases of collective uses for other than dwelling units, the required total of
such off-street parking spaces supplied collectively shall be not less then
eighty-five percent (85%) of the sum of the requirements computed separately,
provided, further, that the applicable district use regulations shall be
complied with. In cases of collective usage involving dwelling units, parking
spaces shall be provided at the rate of one per dwelling unit.
   (g)    Joint Use of Facilities. Off-street parking facilities required for
churches shall be reduced by fifty percent (50%) where such churches:
      (1)    Abut, either directly or across a street or alley, a nonresidence
district; or
      (2)    Are located within a nonresidence district; or
      (3)    Abut a parking lot serving a business or industrial use in a
nonresidence district.

1170.03   Sites affected.
1170.04   Procedure.
1170.05   Responsibility.
1170.06   Construction.
1170.07   Screening and buffer standards for special areas.
   1170.01  PURPOSE OR INTENT.
   (a)   Promoting the use of buffering structures or to conceal detracting
elements between adjacent or contiguous zoning districts.
      
   (b)   Minimizing the possibility of nuisance including potential noise,
glare and visual clutter of parking and service areas.
   (c)   To protect, preserve and promote the aesthetic appeal, character and
value of the surrounding neighborhoods.
   (d)   To soften the appearance of building masses and paved areas and reduce
generation of heat, run-off and noise level of adjacent neighborhoods.
(Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)
   1170.02  WHERE REQUIRED.
   Screen(s) and buffer(s) shall be provided along the common property line
separating all Agricultural and Residential districts from Institutional,
Commercial and Industrial zoning districts as well as between residential
zoning districts at the discretion of the Planning Commission’s or designee’s
plan review.  For purpose of definition, designees described in this chapter
shall be a committee appointed by the Mayor, consisting of the Mayor, Municipal
Director, Safety Service/Public Works Director, Deputy Clerk-Treasurer,
Utilities Director, Environmental Compliance Director and Zoning Clerk.  Final
approval will be given by the Planning Commission.  Visual screening and
physical separations of zoning districts through open space, fencing and
landscaping shall be required.  The extent of the application of this effort
shall be determined by the degree of compatibility between the uses and the
need to promote land use stability based on pre-existing conditions.
(Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)
   1170.03  SITES AFFECTED.
   (a)   New Sites.  No building permit shall be issued hereafter for any
development or the construction of any building, structure or vehicular use
except where a screen or buffer plan for such development or construction has
been approved as required by the provisions of this chapter.
   (b)   Existing Sites.  No building, structure or vehicular use area shall be
constructed or expanded unless the minimum screen or buffer requirement by the
provision of this chapter is provided to the property to the extent of its
alteration or expansion and not for the entire property of which the alteration
or expansion is a part unless the alteration or expansion is substantial.  An
alteration or expansion to an existing property is substantial when:
      (1)   In the case of a building or structure expansion which does not
involve additional land, the square footage of the alteration exceeds twenty-
five percent (25%) of the existing building.
      (2)   In the case where new land is involved, the new land or the
expanded square footage of structure exceeds by twenty-five percent (25%) of
the existing site or structure.
      (3)   Land as used herein includes land used for space, parking or
building.
         (Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)
   1170.04  PROCEDURE.
   Whenever any property is affected by these buffer and/or screening
requirements, or where such plans are a part of an application for rezoning,
variance, a conditional use permit or development plan approval, such plans
shall be submitted for review to the Planning Commission or designee for review
and final approval before a building permit is issued.  A public hearing will
be held for comment at the regularly scheduled Planning Commission meeting,
where final approval may be given at this time.  No final approval shall be
given to the applicant until all Federal, State and local requirements are met.
   (a)   Environmental review of the land if required.
   (b)   Necessary EPA permitting.
   (c)   State building permits.
   (d)   Local utility permits to install.
   (e)   Negotiated traffic concerns with Village; off-street parking
facilities included, but not limited.
      (Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)
   1170.05  RESPONSIBILITY.
   Provisions for such buffer areas and construction of required screens shall
be the responsibility of the property owner or developer introducing the new
use as defined by the requirements for screening and buffering within the
individual zoning districts.  All buffers and screens shall be maintained in a
condition reasonably representing the original condition, recognizing growth of
natural vegetation, and shall be replaced upon the recommendation of the
Building Inspector for the Village as necessary.  The property owner shall be
responsible for such maintenance and/or replacement of buffer areas and
acreens, including but not limited to, appropriate trimming of natural
vegetation, painting and general repair.  The Building Inspector shall provide
a time limit as to when the work (repairs) shall be completed.  The property
owner may request an extension based upon weather, access to materials or for
some other reasons beyond their control.  However, if repairs are not
completed, there shall be no other issuance of building permits or extended
utilities until the end of the matter is resolved.
(Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)
   1170.06  CONSTRUCTION.
   All screens or buffers required or provided shall be constructed of any
combination of natural and man-made elements to comply with the height and
material requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.  All vertical screening elements
between incompatible land uses and required within the various zoning districts
of the Zoning Ordinance shall be a minimum height of six feet.  Natural screens
made of vegetation having a mature height greater than six feet may be required
in cases where the difference in topography and/or intensity of the two uses
being screened merits such action.  Either type of screening or buffer shall
not obscure traffic visibility within fifty feet or reasonable consideration of
an intersection.  The height of such screen may be adjusted to prevent limits
to visibility that may affect safety.
   (a)   For the purposes of this chapter, screening and buffer areas shall
consist of objects:
      (1)   Kept in good condition;
      (2)   Free of advertisements of other signs.
   (b)   Buffer areas shall be landscaped and screened at the discretion of the
Planning Commission or their designee whenever applicable.
   (c)   Screening materials.  For the purpose of screening incompatible land
uses, the property owner may utilize any combination of the following:  masonry
wall, wooden fences, earthen mounds, natural vegetation hedges and plantings,
open space or any other material approved by the Planning Commission.
      (Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)
   1170.07  SCREENING AND BUFFER STANDARDS FOR SPECIAL AREAS.
   (a)   Service Courts and Loading Dock Areas.
      (1)   For commercial, industrial, office/institutional and community
service areas, including access to loading of all these areas, all areas used
for service, loading and unloading activities shall be screened along the
entire affected lot line to the building setback line, if adjacent to or
abutting a residential district.  It is the responsibility of the property
owner to conduct decibel ratings and propose audible screening.  May need to be
adjusted, based upon actual screening effect if determined inadequate.
      (2)   Screening shall consist of walls, fences, natural vegetation or an
acceptable combination of these elements.  Such standards for special areas
shall be presented to the Planning Commission for plan review.
   (b)   Screening of Trash Container Receptacles.  For commercial, community
service, industrial, office/institutional and multiple family uses, all trash
containers or receptacles shall be screened or enclosed.  Trash containers
designed to service more than one residential unit or to service a
nonresidential structure shall be screened by walls, fences or natural
vegetation or an acceptable combination of these elements.  Trash containers
shall not be located in the front yard building setback and shall be considered
the same as loading and access to loading and shall be required to also meet
the audible screening section of this chapter and shall be in compliance with
the side and rear yard setbacks of the applicable zoning district and have
maintained accessible entry to containers.  Other requirements regarding
screening of receptacles, such as height, will be determined by the Planning
Commission or their designee.  (Ord. 96-03.  Passed 2-26-96.)

   1171.01  PURPOSE.
   (a)   The purpose of this chapter shall be to coordinate the type, placement
and physical dimensions of signs within the different zoning districts; to
recognize the commercial communication requirements of all sectors of the
business community; to encourage the innovative use of design; to promote both
renovation and maintenance; to allow for special circumstances; and to
guarantee equal treatment under the law through accurate record keeping and
consistent enforcement.  These shall be accomplished by regulation of the
display, erection, use and maintenance of signs.
   This chapter also encourages the proper development and use of graphic
signage systems and to regulate signs and signing systems so as not to endanger
the public safety of individuals; confuse, mislead or obstruct the vision
necessary for traffic safety; negatively impact property values; or otherwise
endanger public health, safety, welfare and morals.
   (b)   This chapter shall not relate to building design; Nor shall this
chapter regulate window displays; official traffic or government signs; the
copy and message of signs; signs not intended to be viewed from a public right-
of-way; product dispensers and point of purchase displays not intended to be
viewed from a public right-of-way; scoreboards on athletic fields; flags of any
nation, government or noncommercial organization; gravestones; the display of
street numbers; or any display or construction not defined herein as a sign.
   Thus, the primary intent of this chapter shall be to regulate signs of a
commercial nature intended to be viewed from any public right-of-way.

   All buildings or structures which are structurally unsafe or not provided
with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise
dangerous to human life or which in relation to existing use constitute a
hazard to health by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation or
obsolescence, are for the purpose of this chapter, "unsafe buildings".  All
such unsafe buildings are declared to be public nuisances and shall be abated
by repair and rehabilitation or by demolition in accordance with the procedure
of this chapter.
(Ord. 1347.  Passed 10-25-93.)
   1329.02  REVIEW BOARD.
   The Village Review Board, hereinafter referred to as the “Board”, shall
consist of the Village Building Inspector, who shall be the Mayor, one member
from Council appointed by Council, and the Fire Chief.  If the Fire Chief is
unable to perform in respect to this chapter, then the Assistant Fire Chief
shall be a member of the Board.  The Board shall examine or cause to be
examined every building or structure or portion thereof on the exterior and/or
interior reported as or believed to be an unsafe building as defined in Section
1329.01.
   A member of the Board having obtained consent from the property owner or
tenant in possession may enter at reasonable times or such other times as may
be necessary, any building or structure or portion thereof alleged to be unsafe
or in a nuisance condition, for the purpose of making inspections and
performing their duties.
   If acting pursuant to actual or apparent emergency conditions, such persons
described above may so enter without first obtaining consent of the property
owner or tenant in possession.
   If consent for entry or inspection is refused or cannot be obtained, or if
for any other reason an inspector is unable to enter or obtain free access to a
structure for the purpose of inspection, the inspector may apply to any court
of record for an administrative inspection warrant pursuant to Ohio R.C.
2933.21(F) under any of the following circumstances:
   (a)   If any inspection required pursuant to law is refused, hindered or
thwarted by the owner or agent of the owner;

the existence of articulable physical conditions which are or may become
hazardous to the public health, safety or welfare of any person or persons; or
   (c)   The Board has reason to believe, based on a complaint, that hazardous
or dangerous conditions exist.
   (d)   If the owner cannot be found.
   The Board shall give written notice to the owner or owners of record,
including any purchasers under a recorded land contract and to the persons
occupying such building, if they are not the owners thereof.  The written
notice shall specifically state the defects that cause the building to be
unsafe.  The notice shall state that a hearing will be held before the Board at
a place therein fixed not less than ten days nor more than thirty days after
the serving of the notice; that the owner and parties in interest may file an
answer to the complaint and appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony
at the place and time fixed in the notice, and that the rules of evidence
prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings
before the public officer.  (Ord. 16-15.  Passed 11-14-16.)
   1329.03  ORDER TO REPAIR; DEMOLISH.

unsafe building, it shall state in writing its findings of fact in support of
such determination and shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner
thereof an order requiring the owner:
   (a)   Within the time specified in the order, to repair, alter or improve
the structure to render it fit for human habitation, occupancy or use, or at
the option of the owner, to vacate and close the structure if the repair,
alteration or improvement of the structure can be made at a cost that is not
more than fifty percent (50%) of the value of the structure; or

deemed to be properly served, if a copy thereof is sent by registered mail to
the last known address of the owner of record.  If any of the parties cannot be
located, nor can his address be ascertained, this notice shall be deemed to be
properly served if a copy thereof is placed in a conspicuous place in or about
the building or structure affected by this notice.  If such notice is by
registered mail, the period within which such owner is required to comply with
the order of the Board shall begin as of the date he received such notice.
(Ord. 1347.  Passed 10-25-93.)
   1329.05  POSTING OF SIGNS.
   The Board shall cause to be posted at each entrance to such building a
notice to read:  "DO NOT ENTER, UNSAFE TO OCCUPY.  VILLAGE OF OTTAWA, OHIO".

thereof, such party, either the owner of record or the purchaser under a land
contract, shall be subject to the penal provision of this chapter and the Board
shall proceed to have the building or structure or portion thereof demolished
and removed from the premises, leaving the premises in a clean, safe, and
sanitary condition and the cost of such work shall be paid by the Village.  If
the Village is not immediately reimbursed for such costs, the amount thereof
shall be certified to the County Treasurer and levied as a special assessment
against the property on which the building or structure is located and shall be
collected in the manner provided for in Ohio R.C. 715.261.

cannot be immediately remedied so as to remove any danger therefrom, shall,
within twenty-four hours after such discovery, report the existence of such
dangerous condition to the Board, who shall forthwith take such steps as may be
necessary to protect the public safety and welfare.  If the Board cannot be

   1333.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens.  Therefore, the Council of
the Village of Ottawa, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows. 
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Ottawa has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base.  Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.  In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted. 
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the flood
plain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program. 
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property  due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other
areas. 
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.05  LANDS TO WHICH THIS CHAPTER APPLIES.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Ottawa as identified in Section
1333.06 including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Ottawa.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)    For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
Flood Insurance Rate Map for Putnam County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
effective June 20, 2018
Flood Insurance Study for Putnam County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas effective
June 20, 2018
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations.  Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village of Ottawa Municipal Building, 136

   1333.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes.  In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed.  These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a State or Federal Law, such State or Federal Law shall take precedence over
these regulations. 
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-6-04.)
   1333.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purpose and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations.  Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions.  Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes.  These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage.  These
regulations shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Ottawa,
any officer or employee thereof, of the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
for any flood damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any
administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   1333.11  DEFINITIONS.
   (a)   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
      (1)   “Accessory structure”  means a structure on the same lot with, and
of a nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
      (2)   “Appeal” means a request for review of the floodplain
administrator’s interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a
request for a variance.
      (3)   “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.  The base flood may also be referred to
as the 1% chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
      (4)   “Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE)” means the water surface
elevation of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the
National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum
of 1988, and usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL).  In Zone AO areas,
the base flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number
(from 1 to 3 feet).       
      (5)   “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade
(below ground level) on all sides.
      (6)   “Development” means any manmade change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations
or storage of equipment or materials.
      (7)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.”  See “Lowest Floor.”
      (8)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).” Issued by
President Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted
activities be conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special
flood hazard areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.   
      (9)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)” means the agency with
the overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance
Program.
      (10)   “Fill” means a deposit of earth material placed by artificial
means.   
      (11)   “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
         A.   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
         B.   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
      (12)   “Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM)”.  Usually the initial map,
produced by the Federal emergency Management Agency, or U. S. Department of
Housing and Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special
flood hazard areas.
      (13)   “Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)”  means an official map on which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
      (14)   “Flood Insurance Risk  Zones” means zone designations on FHBMs and
FIRMs that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community.  Following are the zone definitions:
         A.   Zone A:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are not determined.
         B.   Zones A1-A30 and Zone AE:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; base flood
elevations are determined.
         C.   Zone AO:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; with flood depths
of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain); average depths are
determined.
         D.   Zone AH:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood; flood depths of 1
to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood elevations are determined.
         E.   Zone A99:
Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year flood to be protected from
the 100- year flood by a Federal flood protection system under construction; no
base flood elevations are determined.
         F.   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):
Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject to the 100-year flood with average
depths of less than 1 foot or with contributing drainage area less than 1
square mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
         G.   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):
Areas determined to be outside the 500-year floodplain.
      (15)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS)” means the official report in which
the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U. S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes
shown on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of
the base flood.
      (16)   “Flood Protection Elevation” means the Flood Protection Elevation,
or PFE, is the base flood elevation plus one foot of freeboard.  In areas where
no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood
protection elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood
elevations determined and/or approved by the floodplain administrator.
      (17)   “Floodway” means  the channel of a river or other watercourse and
the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge.  A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height.  In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.  The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and
is usually characterized by any of the following:  Moderate to high velocity
flood waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to
high erosion forces.
      (18)   “Freeboard”  means a factor of safety usually expressed in feet
above a flood level for the purposes of floodplain management.  Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and
floodway conditions, such as wave actions, obstructed bridge openings, debris
and ice jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
      (19)   “Historic Structure”    means any structure that is:
         A.   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places
(a listing maintained by the U. S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
         B.   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
         C.   Individually listed on the State of Ohio’s inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (20)   “Hydrologic and  Hydraulic Engineering Analysis” means an analysis
performed by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in
accordance with standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to
determine flood elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
      (21)   “Letter of Map Change (LOMC)” means  an official FEMA
determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.  LOMC’s
are broken down into the following categories:
         A.   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA).  A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area.  A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate
Map and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
         B.   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR).  A revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. 
One common type of LOMR, LOMR-F is a determination concerning whether a
structure of parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevations
and is therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
         C.   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR).  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria.  A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
      (22)   “Lowest Floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure.  This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirement specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
      (23)   “Manufactured Home”  means a structure, transportable in one or
more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use
with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required
utilities.  The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational
vehicle".  For the purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes
manufactured homes and mobile homes as defined in Section 3781.06 of the Ohio
Revised Code.
      (24)     "Manufactured Home Park"  As specified in the Ohio
Administrative Code 4781-12-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of
land upon which three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are
parked, either free of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any
roadway, building, structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as
part of the facilities of the park.  A tract of land that is subdivided and the
individual lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the
purpose of installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a
manufactured home park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked
thereon, if the roadways are dedicated to the local government authority. 
Manufactured home park does not include any tract of land used solely for the
storage or display for sale of manufactured homes.  (Ord. 18-10.  Passed 6-11-
18.)
      (25)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP)”.  The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding.  This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods.  Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
      (26)   “New Construction” means structures for which the “start of
construction” commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Village
of Ottawa Flood Insurance Rate Map, dated January 3, 1986, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
      (27)   “Person” includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies.  An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any government entity of the state and includes,
but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau,
society, council, institution, state college or university, community college
district, technical college district, or state community college. “Agency” does
not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general’s
department, or any court.
      (28)   “Recreational Vehicle” means a vehicle which is (1) built on a
single chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest
horizontal projection, (3) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable
by a light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
      (29)   “Registered Professional Architect” means a person registered to
engage in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01
to 4703.19 of the Revised Code.
      (30)   “Registered Professional Engineer” means a  person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
      (31)   “Registered Professional Surveyor” means a person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
      (32)   “Special Flood Hazard Area”.  Also know as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard”, it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year.  Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate
Maps, Flood Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood
Hazard Boundary Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99.  Special flood
hazard areas may also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from
other federal, state or local sources of data including but not limited to
historical flood information reflecting high water marks, pervious flood
inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
      (33)   “Start of Construction”  means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date.  The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation.  Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.  For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.

or gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
      (35)   “Substantial damage” means damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged
condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred. 
      (36)   “Substantial Improvement” means any reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement.  This term
includes structures which have incurred “substantial damage”, regardless of the
actual repair work performed.  The term does not, however, include:   
         A.   Any improvement to a structure which is considered “new
construction,”
         B.   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state of local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
         C.   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
      (37)   “Variance” means a  grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
      (38)   “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development
to be fully compliant with these regulations.

   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
Minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that the Village of Ottawa flood maps, studies and other data identified
in Section
1333.06 accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirements to Submit New Technical Data.
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available.  These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1333.13(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with subsection (j)(1) hereof, prepared in a format
required for a Conditional Letter of Map Revision or Letter of Map Revision,
and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and processing fees for these map revisions
shall be the responsibility of the applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of 
Map Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to subsection (j)
(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information  shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details.  Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Ottawa,
and may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Ottawa have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area.  In order that the
Village of Ottawa’s Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the Village
of Ottawa boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the
Village of Ottawa suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate
limits or the new area for which the Village of Ottawa had assumed or
relinquished floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations.  Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA
floodmaps and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain
Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:

the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the Purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA.  Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard.  A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1333.14.
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc.  After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
         B.   Coordinate substantial damage determinations by qualified
personnel for damaged structures located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process.  These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in  special
flood hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

reduction of the flood carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.  Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1333.12(j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas which
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;
            4.   Documentation of individual legal notices to all impacted
property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and,
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of the Village of Ottawa and the
Chief Executive Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed
actions.
      (2)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks. 
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
“bankfull stage.”  The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based
on methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites:An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source.  For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished.  Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water Resources, must be
notified prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse.  Evidence of
such notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
            (Ord. 18-10.  Passed 6-11-18.)
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished.  The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with the
Village of Ottawa specifying the maintenance responsibilities.  If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1333.12(j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocations or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
(Ord. 04-13.  Passed 7-26-04.)
   (j)   Critical Development. 
      (1)    Critical development is that which is critical to the community's
public health and safety, are essential to the orderly functioning of a
community, store or produce highly volatile, toxic or water-reactive materials,
or house occupants that may be insufficiently mobile to avoid loss of life or
injury.  Examples of critical development include jails, hospitals, schools,
fire stations, nursing homes, wastewater treatment facilities, water plants,
and gas/oil/propane storage facilities.
      (2)    Critical Developments shall be elevated to the 500-year flood
elevation or be elevated to the highest known historical flood elevation (where
records are available), whichever is greater.  If no data exists establishing
the 500-year flood elevation or the highest known historical flood elevation,
the applicant shall provide a hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis
that generates 500-year flood elevation data.
   (k)   Fill.   The following standards apply to all fill activities in
special flood hazard areas:
      (1)   Fill sites, upon which structures will be constructed or placed,
must be compacted to 95 percent of the maximum density obtainable with the
Standard Proctor Test method or an acceptable equivalent method,
      (2)   Fill slopes shall not be steeper than one foot vertical to two feet
horizontal,
      (3)   Adequate protection against erosion and scour is provided for fill
slopes.  When expected velocities during the occurrence of the base flood of
five feet per second armoring with stone or rock protection shall be provided. 
When expected velocities during the base flood are five feet per second or less
protection shall be provided by covering them with vegetative cover.
      (4)   Fill shall be composed of clean granular or earthen material. 
   (l)   Storage of Materials.  Storage of material or equipment not otherwise
prohibited in subsection (a)(2) hereof shall be firmly anchored to prevent
flotation.

Floodplain Administrator.  Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator’s decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance.  The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owning to special conditions of the lot or
parcel, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would
result in unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a Variance.
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
         C.   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a
variance application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the Village of
Ottawa.
      (2)   Notice for Public Hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator.  Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public Hearing.
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires.  In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use
which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location where
applicable.
            7.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan
and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the flood waters and the effects of wave actions, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property.  Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other Conditions for Variances.
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may by issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsections (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered.  As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre,
the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevations below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
      (5)   Procedure at Hearings.
         A.   All testimony shall be given under oath.
         B.   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
         C.   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and
testimony in support of the appeal or variance.
         D.   The administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
         E.   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the
adverse party or their counsel.
         F.   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
         G.   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
         H.   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision.  The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
      (6)   Appeal to the Court.  Those aggrieved by the decision of the
Appeals Board may appeal such decision to the Putnam County Court of Common
Pleas, as provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code.
