(1998); TO REPEAL ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN CONFLICT THEREWITH; TO PUBLISH
THE ENACTMENT OF NEW MATTER; AND TO DECLARE AN EMERGENCY.
   WHEREAS, Council has had the matter of codification and general revision of
the legislation of the Village before it for some time, and
   WHEREAS, it has heretofore entered into a contract with The Justinian
Publishing Company to prepare and publish such codification, and
   WHEREAS, the codification of such legislation, together with the new matter
to be adopted, the matters to be amended and those to be repealed, is now
before the Council,
   NOW THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED BY THE COUNCIL OF THE VILLAGE OF POLAND,
MAHONING COUNTY, OHIO:
   SECTION 1:  That the ordinances and resolutions of the Village of Poland,
Ohio, of a general and permanent nature, as revised, codified, arranged and
consolidated into component codes, titles, chapters and sections, are hereby
approved, adopted and enacted as the Codified Ordinances of Poland, Ohio, 1998.
   One book-form copy of the Codified Ordinances shall be certified as correct
by the Mayor and the Clerk-Treasurer, attached to this ordinance as a part
hereof, and filed with the permanent ordinance records of the Village of
Poland, Ohio.
   SECTION 2:  That all ordinances and resolutions or parts thereof which are
in conflict or inconsistent with any provision of the Codified Ordinances are
hereby repealed as of the effective date of this ordinance, except as follows:
      (a)   The enactment of the Codified Ordinances shall not be construed to
affect a right or liability accrued or incurred under any legislative provision
prior to the effective date of such enactment, or an action or proceeding for
the enforcement of such right or liability.  Such enactment shall not be
construed to relieve any person from punishment for an act committed in
violation of any such legislative provision, nor to affect an indictment or
prosecution therefor.  For such purposes, any such legislative provision shall
continue in full force notwithstanding its repeal for the purpose of revision
and codification.
      (b)   The repeal provided above shall not affect:
         (1)   The grant or creation of a franchise, license, right, easement
or privilege;
         (2)   The purchase, sale, lease or transfer of property;
         (3)   The appropriation or expenditure of money or promise or

which summary is attached hereto.
   SECTION 4:  That all sections and subsections in the Codified Ordinances of
Poland without an ordinance or resolution history, or with the words "Adopting
Ordinance" at the end thereof, are or contain new matter in the Codified
Ordinances, said new matter having been found to be necessary, in the course of
preparing the Codified Ordinances, to render the legislation of the Village
internally consistent and consistent with State law, where and as required by
Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution, as well as to adopt the
latest editions of technical codes adopted by the Village by reference, and
said new matter is hereby approved, adopted and enacted.  A summary of such new
matter is attached to this ordinance as Exhibit A and the same shall be
published, together with notice of the adoption of this ordinance, as

law, with which to administer the affairs of the Village, preserve law and
order and avoid practical and legal entanglements, wherefore this ordinance,
including the Codified Ordinances of Poland, 1998, hereby approved, adopted and
enacted, shall be in full force and effect immediately upon its passage and
approval by the Mayor; otherwise from and after the earliest period allowed by
law.

EDITOR'S NOTE
   The numbering system used in these Codified Ordinances is similar to that
used in the Ohio Revised Code and is consistent with general practice. Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number. For
example, 238.02 indicates that the code number is 2, the chapter number is 238
(or the 38th chapter within code 2), and the section number is .02. The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being the
first two digits left of the decimal. The section number appears to the right
of the decimal. As another example, 408.01 indicates that the code number is 4,
the chapter number is 408 (or the 8th chapter within code 4), and the section
number is .01.
   With this numbering system, the Codified Ordinances may be expanded almost
endlessly. Codes, titles and chapters are initially even-numbered, thus
reserving the use of odd numbers for future legislation. Sections within
chapters are consecutively numbered, except that penalty provisions are usually
assigned the number .99, as in the Revised Code.  Exceptions are the Traffic
and General Offenses Codes, where the penalties are either grouped in one
chapter in each Code or are included as part of the sections.  Newly created
sections subsequent to the original codification may be indicated by three
digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly belongs between two
consecutively numbered sections. For example, newly created 660.061, 660.062
and 660.063 follow 660.06 and precede 660.07 to be placed in their logical
position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section. The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code. Sections and subsections without
histories or with the words "Adopting Ordinance" at the end thereof are or
contain new matter ordained by the Adopting Ordinance that enacts these
Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance and resolution included in these Codified Ordinances. It indicates
whether a given ordinance or resolution was consolidated with another into one
section or split into two or more sections. Cross references direct the user to
subject matter reasonably related to material contained within a given chapter.

phrases that have acquired a technical or particular meaning, whether by
legislative definition or otherwise, shall be construed accordingly.

      (1)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day; except that when
the last day falls on Sunday or a legal holiday, then the act may be done on
the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal holiday.
      (2)   When a public office, in which an act required by law is to be
performed, is closed to the public for the entire day that constitutes the last
day for doing the act or before its usual closing time on that day, the act may
be performed on the next succeeding day that is not a Sunday or a legal
holiday.
      (3)   “Legal holiday,” as used in divisions (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this
section, means the following days:
         A.   The first day of January, known as New Year's day;
         B.   The third Monday in January, known as Martin Luther King day;

depends upon the order of events on the same day, such priority shall be
determined by the times in the day at which they respectively occurred.
(ORC 1.15)
      (6)   If a number of months is to be computed by counting the months from
a particular day, the period ends on the same numerical day in the concluding

   (f)   Exceptions. The rules of construction shall not apply to any law which
shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when the

202.04   REVIVOR; EFFECT OF RE-ENACTMENT, AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing provision of the Codified Ordinances does
not revive the provision originally repealed nor impair the effect of any
saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of a provision of the Codified
Ordinances does not, except as provided in division (c) of this section:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the provision or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred with respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy with respect to any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
provision had not been repealed or amended.
   (c)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re- enactment or amendment of a provision of the Codified Ordinances, the
penalty, forfeiture or punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed
according to the provision as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
202.05   CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of a provision of the Codified Ordinances
applies to all re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections, or of subsections or other subdivisions of a section, such
reference shall be construed to mean a violation of any section, subsection or
other such subdivision included in such reference.
   (c)   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized
under designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case,
action taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.
(ORC 1.23)
   (d)   Whenever in one section reference is made to another section hereof,
the reference shall extend and apply to the section referred to as subsequently
amended, revised, recodified, or renumbered, unless the subject matter be
changed or materially altered by the amendment or revision.
202.06   CONFLICTING PROVISIONS.
   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both. If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
   (d)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different meetings
of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments are to
be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each. If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails. The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable. Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)
202.07   DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council, may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
202.08   SEPARABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of these Codified Ordinances or the
application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, the
invalidity does not affect other provisions or applications of the section or
related sections which can be given effect without the invalid provision or
application, and to this end the provisions are separable.
(ORC 1.50)
202.99    GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in these Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, the commission or performance
of such act, or the failure to commit or perform such act, as required, shall,
unless another penalty is provided, be deemed a minor misdemeanor and the
offender shall be fined not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each
offense. A separate offense shall be deemed committed each day during or on
which a violation or noncompliance occurs or continues, unless otherwise
provided.
CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE:  The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time
from 2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday
in October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a state legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard.  The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State of Ohio.
   On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act
changed the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States.
Beginning in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m.
on the second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the
first Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of
this change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

238.08   INVESTMENT POLICY.

compliance with S.B. No. 81, an investment policy as set forth herein.
   (b)   Scope.  The investing authority for the Village shall reside with the
Fiscal Officer in accordance with this investment policy.  This policy is
designed to cover all monies under the control of the Fiscal Officer and those
that comprise the core investment portfolio.  Notwithstanding the policies
detailed in this section, Ohio R.C. Chapter 135 will be adhered to at all
times.
   (c)   Objectives and Guidelines.  The following investment objectives will
be applied in the management of Village funds:
      (1)   The primary objective shall be the preservation of capital and the
protection of principal while earning investment interest.
      (2)   In investing public funds, the Fiscal Officer will strive to exceed
or at least equal the average market rate of return on the investment portfolio
over the course of budgetary and economic cycles, taking into account State
law, safety considerations and cash flow requirements.
      (3)   The investment portfolio shall remain sufficiently liquid to enable
the Fiscal Officer to meet reasonably anticipated operating requirements.
      (4)   The investment portfolio shall be diversified in order to avoid
incurring potential losses regarding individual securities which may not be
held to maturity, whether by erosion of market value or change in market
conditions, that will not exceed the income generated by the portfolio.
      (5)   Investments shall be made with the exercise of that degree of
judgment and care, under circumstances then prevailing, which persons of

considered a derivative instrument.

instrument or security authorized by Ohio R.C. Chapter 135, as amended.  A copy

      (6)   Labor Day
      (7)   Columbus Day

      (10)   Christmas Day
   ** Veterans' Day is an optional holiday in that this day may only be
exchanged for another work day with thirty days advance notification and at the
discretion of the department supervisor based upon staffing needs. An optional
holiday is to be taken for extended time off and is not subject to a premium
holiday payment.

officers scheduled to work on Easter Sunday.
   (b)   If a full-time employee works on a paid holiday that is a regularly
scheduled holiday, that employee will be paid the regular rate of pay plus
eight hours holiday pay.  Call-in for an early shift of two hours or less that
falls on a paid holiday does not make the employee eligible for holiday pay. 
Overtime scheduling that necessitates two hours of work at the end of a shift
that falls on a paid holiday does not make the employee eligible for holiday
pay.  Full-time employees who do not work the holiday shall receive eight hours
holiday pay, provided that the employee has worked the last regularly scheduled
day prior to the holiday and the first regularly scheduled day after the
holiday.  A pre-approved scheduled vacation the day before or the day after a
paid holiday will maintain the employee's eligibility for holiday pay.  Changes
in State laws regarding changes in paid holidays shall be regarded as
applicable to full-time employees of the Village without the necessity of
modifying this section to conform to such State law changes.

beginning with the first full pay period following the date they complete the
required years of service.
   (b)   Computations for Eligibility.  Years of continuous service shall be
computed based on active payroll records.  Credit for actual active military
service will be allowed.
   (c)   Scheduling.  A complete annual vacation request schedule, with
vacation taken in full week units, must be submitted in writing before April 1,
and must be approved by the appropriate department supervisor.  No less than
one week (seven calendar days) in advance, an employee may request that the
employee's supervisor modify the employee's written schedule.  The decision as
to whether to grant a change in the vacation schedule, including the use of
vacation days in less than full week units of five consecutive days, is solely
at the discretion of the supervisor based upon staffing needs.
   (d)   Accumulated Vacation Time.  Vacation leave shall be taken prior to an
employee's next anniversary date or the employee shall forfeit the vacation
time and/or pay.  The Mayor, with the consent of Council, may permit a ninety-
day extension period should an employee be forced to adjust his or her vacation
due to a Village emergency.  At no time shall two employees of the same
department be granted the same week or weeks of vacation or time off for
military leave.  Wherever possible, employees will be accommodated on their
request for vacation scheduling.  When duplicate weeks are requested,
department seniority shall prevail in the approval of a vacation schedule.

hours per month.  Sick leave shall be compensated at one hundred percent of his
or her base rate of pay. This sick leave shall be computed from the active date
of service from the date of employment. No paid sick leave shall accumulate
during unpaid leaves except military leave.  Paid sick leave shall not be
counted as eight hours worked for holiday payment eligibility (day before or
day after a holiday) or for overtime calculation.
      (2)   Employees may use accumulated sick leave for absence due to
personal illness, pregnancy, personal injury, injury on the job (five days
maximum), exposure to contagious disease which could be communicated to other
employees, and illness, injury or death in the employee's immediate family,
including mothers, fathers, spouse, siblings and/or children.  In no event

the employee's immediate family.
      (3)   After three consecutive days of personal illness, the employee must
have one of the following:  proof of a doctor's visit, consultation or a

continuing nature, requests for additional medical information shall also be
the right of Council.

weeks notice, and works the two weeks, then, unless instructed to terminate
immediately by the department head, he or she shall be paid for all accumulated
but unused sick leave up to the maximum of thirty days at the current base
rate, and the same is to be included and considered as severance pay, subject
to the provisions of Ordinance 973-94, passed October 18, 1994.  If any
employee is discharged for committing a serious infraction, for improper
conduct, dereliction of duty, fraud, etc., he or she shall forfeit all annual
and accumulated sick leave.
   (c)   Unpaid Sick Leave.  Unpaid sick leave may be granted for extended
personal injury or personal illness at the discretion of the department head
and the approval of Council on a case-by-case basis and in accordance with the
Federal Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993.
   (d)   Military Leave.
      (1)   In the event that full-time employees are required to serve
military duty on an active status, they shall be granted a leave of absence
which will not be counted against continuity of service if they return to the
Village within thirty days of discharge from the military.  Qualifying extended
military leave shall be counted as active service for vacation, but no payment
shall be made for vacation accrued while on military leave.  Full-time
employees who are members of the Ohio National Guard or any United States
military reserve unit shall be granted temporary military leave with pay when
ordered to temporary active duty or annual military training exercises for not
to exceed thirty-one days in a calendar year.  Military leave pay shall be the
difference between the employee's regular pay and his or her service pay.  An
employee may, at his or her option, elect an alternative to regular pay,
instead of regular pay, and use accumulated vacation pay in lieu of military
leave pay.

the leave on the department vacation schedule by April 1 of the affected year. 
Within ninety days of the temporary leave, an employee shall supply the

privacy in any message, file, image or data created, sent, retrieved or
received by use of the Village's equipment and/or access. The Village has a
right to monitor any and all aspects of their computer systems including, but
not limited to, sites, instant messaging systems, chat groups, or news groups
visited by users, material downloaded or uploaded by users, and e-mail sent or
received by users. Such monitoring may occur at any time, without notice, and
without the user's permission. In addition, electronic records may be subject
to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) and, therefore, available for public
distribution.
      (4)   Prohibited Activities. Certain activities are prohibited when using
the Internet or electronic communications. These include, but are not limited
to:
         A.   Accessing, downloading, printing or storing information with
sexually explicit content;
         B.   Downloading or transmitting fraudulent, threatening, obscene,
intimidating, defamatory, harassing, discriminatory, or otherwise unlawful
messages or images;
         C.   Installing or downloading computer software, programs, or
executable files without authorization from the Mayor;
         D.   Uploading or downloading copyrighted materials or proprietary
information without authorization from the Mayor;
         E.   Uploading or downloading access-restricted information without
authorization from the Mayor;
         F.   Sending e-mail using another's identity, an assumed name, or
anonymously;
         G.   Permitting a non-user to use for purposes of communicating the
message of some third party individual or organization.
      (5)   Security.  The distribution of electronic communications is
difficult to control and routing mistakes can easily occur. Copies of
electronic communications can be forwarded without the sender's knowledge or
permission to unintended recipients. Therefore, electronic communications
should be drafted and sent with at least the same level of care, professional
judgment and discretion as paper memoranda or documents.
   (c)   User responsibilities. The conduct of computer users who access the
Internet or send e-mail with any perceivable relationship to the Village of
Poland may be viewed as reflecting on the character of the Village. When
engaging in such conduct, whether for personal or official purposes, users are
expected to do so in a responsible and professional manner. All users are
responsible for exercising appropriate care to protect the Village's computer
systems against the introduction of viruses or other invasive matter.
   (d)   Violations. Violations of this policy will be addressed with
appropriate disciplinary action or censure. The appropriate level of
disciplinary action will be determined on a case-by-case basis with sanctions
up to or including termination depending on the severity of the offense.
Sanctions will be determined by a majority of Village Council.

TITLE TEN - Judiciary
   
Chap. 290.  Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE:  Ohio R.C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Poland has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Poland ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving moving
traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the corporate
limits of Poland, subject to the limitations of Ohio R.C. 2937.08 and 2938.04. 
In keeping his or her docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the laws
pertaining to county courts.
   Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him or her unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him or her, waives a
jury and consents to be tried by the magistrate.  If the defendant, in such
event, does not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate
shall require the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court
of record in Mahoning County (the Struthers Municipal Court) and the magistrate
shall thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of
proceedings and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the
court of record.  However, Rule 23 (A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure
provides that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he or she demands a jury trial. 
The jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule
9 of the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his or her right to a
jury trial in writing, a Mayor may try the case only if (1) his or her
compensation as a judge is not directly dependent upon criminal case
convictions, or (2) he or she is not the chief executive and administrative
officer of the Municipality and as such responsible for the financial condition
of the Municipality.  Guilty and no contest pleas may be taken by any Mayor.
   Ohio R.C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall
be claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the
clerk of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for
trial or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for
trial, whichever is later.  However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R.C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later.  Failure to claim a jury trial
as provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto.  Ohio R.C.
2938.04 provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of
record, but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial
may be asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of
record as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
   Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury
at any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Poland ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not exceed
a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
   The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated “Rules of
Practice and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common
Pleas,” the adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969.  Amended
Rules, referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1,
1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the operator's commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (OVI), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

414.02   THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals shall be erected at all
intersections with such through highways by the Department of Transportation as
to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities as to highways
under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Where
two or more state routes that are through highways intersect, and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. Whenever the
Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an engineering and
traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop traffic on a
through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this section shall
be construed to prevent the installations. When circumstances warrant, the
Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through highways
under his or her jurisdiction. Before the Director either installs or removes a
stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in writing, of that
proposed action to the affected local authority at least thirty days before
installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways. For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway, or
portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical terminus
of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at which
vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or yield to
traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence districts, the
Municipality may by ordinance designate the street or highway, or portion
thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected residence
district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. Where two or
more through highways designated under this division intersect and no traffic-
control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at
one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local authorities having
jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop. Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs or traffic-control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting the through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.

414.03   TRAFFIC-CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady green signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.

      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady red signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted to enter
the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-way street, after
stopping. The right to proceed with the turn shall be subject to the provisions
that are applicable after making a stop at a stop sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted to enter the intersection to make the movement
indicated by the arrow signal indication, after stopping. The right to proceed
with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the arrow and
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing green signal indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing yellow signal indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing red signal indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C.  4511.61 and 4511.62.
(ORC 4511.13)
414.04   SIGNAL TO CONTROL LANE DIRECTION OF TRAVEL.
   The meanings of lane-use control signal indications are as follows:
   (a)   A steady downward green arrow.  A road user is permitted to drive in
the lane over which the arrow signal indication is located.
   (b)   A steady yellow “X”. A road user is to prepare to vacate the lane over
which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A steady red “X”.  A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.
(ORC 4511.131)
414.05   PEDESTRIAN CONTROL SIGNALS.
   Whenever special pedestrian-control signals exhibiting the words “walk” or
“don't walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm are in
place, these signals shall indicate the following instructions:
   (a)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
   (b)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
   (c)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian shall
not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
   (d)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the continued
use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those signals
were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
   (e)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and shall
not be used.

be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic,  or a qualified technician, chemist or

alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum or blood plasma. This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens. A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion, the physical welfare of the

withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person's own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and (d)(4)C. of this
section,”National Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration established as an administration of the
United States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49
U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including
but not limited to any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.

evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory Report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,

is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the

the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity or amount of any

withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions. For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C.
4511.194.
      (2)   Implied Consent to Chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at Request of Law Enforcement Agent. The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of Death or Unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical Tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)
(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person's whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person's own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice Required. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of Arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
         “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under
state law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the
person was arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a
drug, or a combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance; operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence).
         “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio
driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a
fee to have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of
O.V.I., O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a
listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance
under state or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under
arrest for state O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will
face increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
         (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having
physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.) “If you take any
chemical test required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited
amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled
substance in your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set
by law, your Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you
will have to pay a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
         “If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical
test taken at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions Required by Arresting Officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within twenty-four hours after the
arrest, and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the
license or permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge.
Upon receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C.
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of Officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending thirty
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within twenty-four hours after the
person is given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the
officer's employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to
the Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within forty-eight hours after the
arrest of the person, a sworn report that includes all of the following
statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn Report of Arresting Officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than fourteen days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may
give an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest,
provided the report is complete when given to the arrested person and
subsequently is sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not
later than forty-eight hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting
officer shall send a copy of the sworn report to the court in which the
arrested person is to appear on the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.

driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial Appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or
(B), or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or (C)
or Ohio R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge
resulting from the arrest shall be held within five days of the person's arrest
or the issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance
granted by the court pursuant to Ohio R.C. 4511.197 regarding the issues
specified in that section.

within sixty days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the sixty-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in Ohio
R.C. 4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic
monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
         B.   As an alternative to the mandatory jail terms as required by Ohio

the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)
of this section, the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, the court, in addition to any

this section is unable to pay the cost of the stay in the program, the court
may order that the cost be paid from the court's Indigent Drivers' Alcohol

driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege is suspended
under this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of

on the basis of an engineering and traffic investigation that slow speeds on
any part of a controlled-access highway, expressway or freeway consistently

section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one

public or private property used by the public for purposes of vehicular travel
or parking with more than one person who is not a family member occupying the
vehicle unless the probationary license holder is accompanied by the
probationary license holder's parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of division (a)(1)A. or
(a)(1)B. of this section if, at the time of the violation, the holder of the
probationary driver's license was traveling to or from an official function
sponsored by the school the holder attends, or an emergency existed that
required the holder to operate a motor vehicle in violation of division (a)
(1)A. or (a)(1)B. of this section, or the holder was an emancipated minor.
   (c)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in division (c)(2) of this
section, if a person is issued a probationary driver's license prior to
attaining the age of seventeen years and the person pleads guilty to, is
convicted of or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving
violation during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the
person is issued the probationary driver's license, the holder must be
accompanied by the holder's parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating
a motor vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the
public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking during whichever of the
following time periods applies:
            1.   If, on the date the holder of the probationary driver's
license pleads guilty to, is convicted of or is adjudicated in juvenile court
of having committed the moving violation, the holder has not attained the age
of sixteen and one-half years, during the six-month period commencing on that
date;
            2.   If, on the date the holder pleads guilty to, is convicted of
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed the moving violation,
the holder has attained the age of sixteen and one-half years but not seventeen
years, until the person attains the age of seventeen years.
         B.   If the holder of a probationary driver's license commits a moving
violation during the six-month period after the person is issued the
probationary driver's license and before the person attains the age of
seventeen years and on the date the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of or
is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed the moving violation the
person has attained the age of seventeen years, or if the person commits the
moving violation during the six-month period after the person is issued the
probationary driver's license and after the person attains the age of seventeen
years, the holder is not subject to the restriction described in divisions (c)
(1)A.1. and (c)(1)A.2. of this section unless the court or juvenile court
imposes such a restriction upon the holder.
      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under division (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for occupational or educational driving privileges
without being accompanied by the holder's parent or guardian during the period
of time specified in that division. The court may grant the person such driving
privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the restrictions
established in division (c)(1) will seriously affect the person's ability to
continue in employment or educational training or will cause undue hardship on
the license holder or a family member of the license holder. In granting the
driving privileges, the court shall specify the purposes, times and places of
the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate forms setting forth the
privileges granted. Occupational or educational driving privileges under this
division shall not be granted to the same person more than once. If a person is
convicted of, pleads guilty to or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having
committed a second or subsequent moving violation, any driving privileges
previously granted under this division are terminated upon the subsequent
conviction, plea or adjudication.

does not exceed the total number of occupant restraining devices originally
installed in the motor vehicle by its manufacturer, and each occupant of the
vehicle is wearing all of the available elements of a properly adjusted
occupant restraining device.
   (e)   A restricted license may be issued to a person who is fourteen or
fifteen years of age under proof of hardship satisfactory to the Registrar of
Motor Vehicles.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by division (d) of this section, or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons if that requirement has been or is being violated,
or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a
violation of that requirement.
   (g)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (a)(1)A. or (a)(1)B. of this
section has been or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a
ticket, citation or summons for such a violation or for causing the arrest or
commencing a prosecution of a person for such a violation.

in determining whether a violation of division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4)
or (a)(5) of this section has occurred, it shall be prima facie evidence that
the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that the operator of the
motor vehicle owned by the offender or under the offender's control is in a
category described in division (a)(1), (a)(2), (a)(3), (a)(4) or (a)(5) of this
section if any of the following applies:

in any collision in which the licensee may be involved. When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license. A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed

not having obtained a driver's license.

forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender's driver's or commercial driver's license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender's restricted license was expired at the time of the

the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license or nonresident operating privilege from the range

where the offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender
will not be able to begin serving that term within the sixty-day period
following the date of sentencing.

   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section has been
or is being committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or
summons for a violation of division (c) or (d) of this section or causing the
arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person for a violation of division
(c) or (d) of this section, and absent another violation of law, a law
enforcement officer's view of the interior or visual inspection of a motor
vehicle being operated on any street or highway may not be used for the purpose

to carry out this section.
   (g)   The failure of an operator of a motor vehicle to secure a child in a

vehicle has safely and appropriately restrained the child in accordance with
any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars

   (d)   Officers Not Permitted to Stop Cars to Determine Violation.
Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law enforcement
officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on any street
or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of determining whether a
violation of division (b) of this section has been or is being committed or for
the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for the violation or

the failure of a person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an
automobile being operated by that person is wearing all of the available
elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving
the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this section.
      (2)   If, at the time of an accident involving a passenger car equipped
with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.   It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the occupant;
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car;
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section shall be fined
thirty dollars ($30.00).
      (2)   Whoever violates division (b)(2) of this section shall be subject
to the penalty set forth in Section

division (b)(4) of this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor. If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to a violation of
division (b)(4) of this section, whoever violates division (b)(4) of this
section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

   (a)   State Regulations.
      (1)   The Municipality, with respect to highways under its jurisdiction,
upon application in writing and for good cause shown, may issue a special
permit in writing authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles of a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the
maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in
conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, upon any highway under its
jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a
special permit issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34
may move the vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the special permit
on any highway that is a part of the state highway system when the movement is
partly within and partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality. No
local authority shall require any other permit or license or charge any license
fee or other charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a
vehicle or combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the state
highway system. The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the
holder of a permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for
the movement of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the
jurisdiction of the Municipality. Permits may be issued for any period of time
not to exceed one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines
advisable or for the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   The application for a permit shall be in the form that the
Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe a permit fee to be
imposed and collected when any permit described in this section is issued. The
permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse the Municipality for the
administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit, and also to cover the cost
of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway or a street or highway
structure as the result of the operation of the nonconforming vehicle or
combination of vehicles. For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted
by the Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is
deemed a nondivisible load.
      (4)   The Municipality may issue or withhold a permit. If a permit is to
be issued, the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for
the vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the Municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit shall be carried in the vehicle or combination of
vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to inspection by any police
officer or authorized agent of any authority granting the permit. No person
shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (b)   Violations. Whoever violates division (a) of this section is guilty of
a minor misdemeanor.
(Ohio R.C. 4513.99)
   (c)   Local streets. No person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity
with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37, or exceeding a gross weight of five
tons, upon any street in the Municipality other than state routes and county
roads, except those local streets designated as a truck route and marked as
such by appropriate traffic signs, and except when the operation is necessary
to load or unload property, to go to or from the usual place of storage of the
vehicle or to perform any other legitimate business or act other than passage
through the Municipality. Operators of vehicles so deviating from either a
state route or a designated truck route within the Municipality shall confine
the deviation to that required in order to accomplish the purpose of the
departure. On county roads, Council or other duly designated local authority
shall establish reasonable weight limits commensurate with the construction and
material specifications for the roads and the load resistance of the roads as
determined by the County Engineer. County roads shall be posted with signs
indicating the weight limits.
   (d)   Local permit and conditions. Upon application and for good cause, the
Police Chief may issue a local permit authorizing an applicant to move an
oversize or overweight vehicle or combination of vehicles upon local streets
and highways.
      (1)   No permittee shall be required to obtain a special permit from the
Ohio Director of Transportation for the movement of the vehicle or combination
of vehicles on streets or highways under local jurisdiction. However, the
approval of the Ohio Director of Transportation shall be required for movement
upon state routes as provided in division (a) of this section.
      (2)   The Police Chief may grant a permit for a single or round trip, or
for such period of time, not to exceed one year, as the Police Chief in his or
her discretion deems advisable, or for the duration of any construction
project. The Police Chief may limit or prescribe terms or conditions of

parking locations are required to be designated in accordance with division (e)
of this section shall fail to properly mark the special parking locations in
accordance with that division or fail to maintain the markings of the special
locations, including the erection and maintenance of the fixed or movable

Chief shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered
removed.
      (2)   The Police Chief immediately shall cause a search to be made of the
records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the owner and any
lienholder of a motor vehicle ordered into storage by the Police Chief, and if
known, shall send or cause to be sent notice to the owner or lienholder at his
or her last known address by certified mail with return receipt requested, that
the motor vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed
within ten days of the date of mailing of the notice. The owner or lienholder
of the motor vehicle may reclaim it upon payment of any expenses or charges
incurred in its removal and storage, and presentation of proof of ownership,
which may be evidenced by a certificate of title or memorandum certificate of
title to the motor vehicle. If the owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle

after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the owner of the place of storage or
the owner's employee, and the notice was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the

storage of the vehicle.
      (3)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle
within ten days of the date of mailing the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in Ohio R.C. 4513.62, the Police
Chief, without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the
county in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance
with the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.61. Upon presentation of the affidavit,
the Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Police Chief. If the vehicle is to
be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4513.62, the Police Chief shall execute in triplicate an
affidavit, as prescribed by the registrar of motor vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed, and that all
requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.61 have been complied with. The Police Chief
shall retain the original of the affidavit for his or her records, and shall
furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility. Upon
presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor vehicle salvage dealer,
the Clerk of Courts, within thirty days of the presentation, will issue to such
owner a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances.
      (4)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives
such an affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this
section, the dealer or facility is not required to obtain a state certificate
of title to the motor vehicle in the dealer's or facility's own name if the
vehicle is dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are
delivered to the Clerk of Courts.

public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the
right-of-way of any road or highway for forty-eight hours or longer without
notification to the Police Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in
that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (b)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and Ohio R.C. 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (b) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
municipality;
      (4)   While out of this municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

606.06   LIMITATION ON CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS.

2917.02, a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.11 or 2903.12 if the victim is a peace
officer, a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 that is a felony, or a violation of
former Ohio R.C. 2907.12.
         B.   A conspiracy to commit, attempt to commit, or complicity in
committing a violation set forth in division (a)(3)A. of this section.
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in division (b)(2) of this section,
if the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3) of this
section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for an offense of which an
element is fraud or breach of fiduciary duty within one year after discovery of
the offense either by an aggrieved person or by the aggrieved person's legal
representative who is not a party to the offense.
      (2)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)(3)
of this section has expired, prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2913.49
shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person's legal representative who is not a
party to the offense.
   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)
(3) of this section has expired, prosecution shall be commenced for the
following offenses during the following specified periods of time:
         A.   For an offense involving misconduct in office by a public servant
at any time while the accused remains a public servant, or within two years
thereafter;
         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of Ohio
R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43
(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process unless reasonable diligence is
exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or conceals the accused's identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused's purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a mentally retarded, developmentally
disabled, or physically impaired child under 21 years of age shall not begin to
run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have
occurred.
   (j)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07   REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the section defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the section defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. When the section neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, recklessness is sufficient culpability to commit the offense.
   (c)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense. Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense. Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (d)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor's volition are “involuntary acts.”
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor's control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08   CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is his or her specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is his or her specific intention to engage in conduct of
that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of his or her purpose, when he or
she is aware that his or her conduct will probably cause a certain result or
will probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances
when he or she is aware that the circumstances probably exist.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, he or she perversely disregards a known risk that his or her
conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of a certain
nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with heedless
indifference to the consequences, he or she perversely disregards a known risk
that the circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, he or she fails to perceive or avoid a risk that his or her conduct
may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is negligent
with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse from due
care, he or she fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the circumstances may
exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
606.09   ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission. This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity. “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.10   PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by the organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in that
conduct, or tolerates that conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and the duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.11   ATTEMPTS.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense, of
complicity in the commission of an offense or of conspiracy to commit an
offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to commit the same offense in
violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned his or her effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (e)   (1)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit
an offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for
which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first
degree, to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a
drug abuse offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is
an offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if
that drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number
of unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range
of controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an
attempt is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a
felony, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor. In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision
of Ohio R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to
hazardous wastes, an attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate
state law. An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in
conspiracy, is not an offense under this section.
      (2)   In addition to any other sanctions imposed pursuant to division (e)
(1) of this section for an attempt to commit aggravated murder or murder in
violation of division (a) of this section, if the offender used a motor vehicle
as the means to attempt to commit the offense, the court shall impose upon the
offender a class two suspension of the offender's driver's license, commercial
driver's license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license or
nonresident operating privilege as specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02(A)(2).
      (3)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to attempted rape and
also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a specification of the type described
in Ohio R.C. 2941.1418, 2941.1419 or 2941.1420, the offender shall be sentenced
to a prison term or term of life imprisonment pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2971.03.
   (f)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Drug abuse offense.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
      (2)   “Motor vehicle.” Has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4501.01.
(ORC 2923.02)
606.12   COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Conspire with another to commit the offense in violation of Ohio
R.C. 2923.01;
      (4)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.02 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his or her complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete
and voluntary renunciation of his or her criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he or she
were a principal offender. A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of
this section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
606.13   SELF DEFENSE; LIMITATIONS ON DUTY TO RETREAT PRIOR TO USING FORCE.
   (a)   As used in this section, “residence” and “vehicle” have the same
meanings as in Ohio R.C. 2901.05.
   (b)   For purposes of any section of this code that sets forth a criminal
offense, a person who lawfully is in that person's residence has no duty to
retreat before using force in self defense, defense of another, or defense of
that person's residence, and a person who lawfully is an occupant of that
person's vehicle or who lawfully is an occupant in a vehicle owned by an
immediate family member of the person has no duty to retreat before using force
in self defense or defense of another.

report to law enforcement authorities any gunshot or stab wound that the person
treated or observed, or any serious physical harm to other persons that the
person knows or has reasonable cause to believe resulted from an offense of

   (c)   No person who discovers a body or acquires the first knowledge of the

ambulance service, emergency squad or the coroner in a political subdivision in
which the body is discovered, the death is believed to have occurred, or

telecommunications relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor's
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to disclosure by a
member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to him or her in his or her capacity as such by a person
seeking his or her aid or counsel.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program

Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.05, or to victims of felonious sexual penetration in
violation of former Ohio R.C. 2907.12. As used in this division, “counseling
services” include services provided in an informal setting by a person who, by
education or experience, is competent to provide those services.
   (h)   No disclosure of information pursuant to this section gives rise to
any liability or recrimination for a breach of privilege or confidence.
   (i)   Whoever violates division (a) or (b) of this section is guilty of
failure to report a crime. Violation of division (a)(1) of this section is a

describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual excitement or sado-
masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (b)   “Juvenile.” Any unmarried person under eighteen years of age.
   (c)   “Material.” Any book, magazine, newspaper, pamphlet, poster, print,

discernibly turgid state.
   (h)   “Obscene.” When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to
ordinary adults or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to that group, any material or
performance is “obscene” if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting

to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite.
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way that

serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose.

activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or

666.04   IMPORTUNING.  (REPEALED)

is reckless in that regard) was held unconstitutional in State v. Thompson, 767

content-based restriction on speech). For current felony provisions, see Ohio
R.C. 2907.07.

      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender's same
employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of those offenses may be
tried as a single offense. If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the
value of the property or services involved for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all of the offenses in the series of two or
more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender's same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
the property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
“fair market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

returned the rented property nor made arrangements acceptable with the renter
to return the rented property.
   (c)   To establish that a rentee has an intent to commit theft of rented
property or rental services under division (b)(2) above, a renter may issue a
notice to a rentee demanding the return of the rented property. The renter
shall mail the notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
rentee at the address the rentee gave when the rental contract was executed, or
to the rentee at the last address the rentee or the rentee's agent furnished in
writing to the renter.
   (d)   A demand for the return of the rented property is not a prerequisite
for the prosecution of a rentee for theft of rented property or rental
services. The evidence specified in division (b) above does not constitute the
only evidence that may be considered as evidence of intent to commit theft of
rented property or rental services.

action for any injury, death or loss to person or property that allegedly was

employer is immune from liability in a civil action for any injury, death or

private employer's decision to permit a licensee to bring, or prohibit a
licensee from bringing, a handgun onto the premises or property of the private
employer. As used in this division, “private employer” includes a private

a sign in a conspicuous location on that land or on those premises prohibiting
persons from carrying firearms or concealed firearms on or onto that land or
those premises. Except as otherwise provided in this division, a person who
knowingly violates a posted prohibition of that nature is guilty of criminal
trespass in violation of Ohio R.C. 2911.21(A)(4) and is guilty of a misdemeanor
of the fourth degree. If a person knowingly violates a posted prohibition of
that nature and the posted land or premises primarily was a parking lot or
other parking facility, the person is not guilty of criminal trespass in
violation of Ohio R.C. 2911.21(A)(4) and instead is subject only to a civil
cause of action for trespass based on the violation.

      (5)   A peace officer has the same right to carry a concealed handgun in

peace officer shall be considered to be a licensee in this state.

peace officer identification card issued pursuant to division (b)(6)B. of this
section and a valid firearms requalification certification issued pursuant to

with that agency, the person was trained and qualified to carry firearms in the
performance of the peace officer's duties.
               d.   Before retiring from service as a peace officer with that
agency, the person was regularly employed as a peace officer for an aggregate
of fifteen years or more, or, in the alternative, the person retired from

enforcement officers who serve the agency, the agency may comply with division
(b)(6)B.1. of this section by issuing the same credentials to persons who
retired from service as a peace officer with the agency and who satisfy the

   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
   (a)   “Dangerous offender.” A person who has committed an offense, whose

be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a pattern of
repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender.” A person who has a history of persistent criminal
activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or
she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a person is a

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as

for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;

more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;

(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02   PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender or
religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or 698.03 of this code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)
(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized
pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety
days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty
days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court's consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court's
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender's jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56 or
2947.19 and 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than sixty days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least thirty days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court's own motion, the court, in
the court's sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Sections
666.99 and
698.03 of this code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e) or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court's own motion, the
court, in the court's sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a Department of
Probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the municipal court or county court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the municipal court or the
county court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
state without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender. The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the Department of Probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the Department of Probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e) or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d). Community residential
sanctions include but are not limited to the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term of up to sixty days in a community alternative sentencing
center or district community alternative sentencing center established and
operated in accordance with that section, in the circumstances specified in
that section, with one of the conditions of the sanction being that the
offender complete in the center the entire term imposed.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)C. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender's occupation or care
for the offender's family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term Is Not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court

the offender as determined necessary by the court;
         E.   A term of intensive probation supervision;
         F.   A term of basic probation supervision;
         G.   A term of monitored time;
         H.   A term of drug and alcohol use monitoring, including random drug
testing;
         I.   A curfew term;
         J.   A requirement that the offender obtain employment;
         K.   A requirement that the offender obtain education or training;
         L.   Provided the court obtains the prior approval of the victim, a
requirement that the offender participate in victim-offender mediation;
         M.   If authorized by law, suspension of the offender's privilege to
operate a motor vehicle, immobilization or forfeiture of the offender's motor
vehicle, a requirement that the offender obtain a valid motor vehicle
operator's license, or any other related sanction;
         N.   A requirement that the offender obtain counseling if the offense
is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity's
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed thirty
hours.  After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the
sentence to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to
the appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include but are not
limited to the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court orders as
restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic loss suffered by the victim
as a direct and proximate result of the commission of the offense. If the court
decides to impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on
restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor disputes the amount of
restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the
victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence
the amount of restitution sought from the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
(f)(1)B.2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by
law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A state fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including but not limited to the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including but not limited to a per diem fee for room and
board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of repairing
property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
county's General Fund. The county shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund
to pay the costs incurred by the county pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e)
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the
Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the Fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e) or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e) or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(4), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the state or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility, and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the
judgment debtor. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender's criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(4)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(4)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(4)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, state or political subdivision may
do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2)  or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (5)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(4) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (6)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a county court or
a municipal court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a county court or a municipal court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a municipal court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (7)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.

698.03   IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B) or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
(b)(1)C. of this section.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e) and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.

thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
that penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05   MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C) or 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term or sentence of imprisonment
shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail term or sentence
of imprisonment imposed by a court of this municipality, the state, another
state or the United States. Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this
section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor shall be
served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for felony
served in a state or federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131. When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed eighteen months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21 or 4511.19, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to a prison term

or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04 involving the operation
of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served in a state correctional
institution when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of imprisonment and
prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one or more felonies
under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the consecutive
terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed for a felony
before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.

   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision

violation of any provision of this code of ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed

the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
code of ordinances is substantially equivalent.

1040.01   WATER MAIN CONNECTIONS; CHARGES.
   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3-7 of the Consumers Ohio Water
Company Master Tariff P.U.C.O. No. 2, and any provision of the Ohio
Administrative Code regarding water main extensions, including, but not limited
to, Section 4901:1-15-32, the following shall apply:
   (a)   The Consumers Ohio Water Company (the Company), if it so desires, may
construct a water main which will enable persons situated along such main to
obtain water service not otherwise available from the system.  The Company
shall establish either a per foot frontage charge or a per lot charge to be
collected from each applicant for water service having a frontage along said
main connecting into said main, which charge shall be computed and collected as
follows:
      (1)   The per foot frontage charge shall be computed by taking the
Company's total cost of said main and dividing such cost by the total number of
feet of private property fronting said main, but not including any frontage for
which water service has been or may become available from an existing main of
the system.
      (2)   Each applicant for water service having frontage along said main,
which frontage was taken into consideration in computing the per foot frontage
charge, shall pay to the Company, at the time of making application for
service, a total front footage charge computed by multiplying the per foot
frontage charge by the total foot frontage of the applicant's lot or parcel of
land which is to receive water service.
      (3)   The lot connection charge shall be computed by taking the Company's
total cost of said main and dividing such cost by the total number of lots
receiving service from the mains, but not including any lots for which water
service has been or may become available from an existing main of the system.
         The lot method may be used only when at least sixty percent of the
owners of frontage along a proposed water main request in writing that the lot
method be used.
         Each applicant for water service having a lot along said main, which
lot was taken into consideration in computing the per lot charge, shall pay to
the Company, at the time of making application for service, a connection charge
computed by the lot or number of lots which are to receive water service,
multiplied by the per lot charge.
      (4)   Each applicant shall also pay a related facilities fee.
   (b)   The Company will make no refunds of contributions in aid of
construction or for related facilities charges relative to the extension of any
main extension constructed after the date of this section (Ordinance 1039-97,
passed February 18, 1997), except for advances in excess of actual costs, and
except as set forth in subsection (c) hereof.
   (c)   Where, in the past, the Company has installed main extensions under
the provisions of previous contracts with the Village and/or regulations of the
Public Utilities Commission of Ohio and has accepted certain deposits on such
main extensions which are subject to refund under the provisions of said
contracts, the Company shall be required to continue to make such refunds for
the term of such contracts.
   (d)   Provisions of the Consumers Ohio Water Company Master Tariff P.U.C.O.
No. 2, Section 3-7, and the regulations described therein which are not in
conflict with subsections (a) through (c) hereof, shall continue to apply.

   (e)   Severability. The provisions of this section are hereby declared to be
severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this section or
the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be
held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or
application of this section.
   (f)   Ultimate Responsibility. The standards set forth herein and
promulgated pursuant to this section are minimum standards; therefore this

that there will be no contamination, pollution, nor unauthorized discharge of
pollutants.
   (g)   Discharge Prohibitions.
      (1)   Prohibition of Illegal Discharges. No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any
pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality
standards, other than storm water. The commencement, conduct or continuance of
any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as
described as follows:
         A.   The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions
established by this section — water line flushing or other potable water
sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising
ground water, ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains,
uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including
active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning
condensation, springs, noncommercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian
habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated — typically less
than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source
not containing pollutants.
         B.   Discharges specified in writing by the authorized enforcement
agency as being necessary to protect public health and safety.
         C.   Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal
notification to the authorized enforcement agency prior to the time of the
test.
         D.   The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge
permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the
discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental
Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any
discharge to the storm drain system.
      (2)   Prohibition of Illicit Connections.
         A.   The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of
illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.
         B.   This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit
connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of
connection.
         C.   A person is considered to be in violation of this section if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection
to continue.
   (h)   Suspension of MS4 Access.
      (1)   Suspension Due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations. The
Village of Poland may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a
person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened
discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of
the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order
issued in an emergency, the authorized enforcement agency may take such steps
as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the
United States, or to minimize danger to persons.
      (2)   Suspension Due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge. Any person
discharging to the MS4 in violation of this section may have their MS4 access
terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The
authorized enforcement agency will notify a violator of the proposed
termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the authorized
enforcement agency for a reconsideration and hearing.
      (3)   A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to
premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
authorized enforcement agency.
   (i)   Industrial or Construction Activity Discharges. Any person subject to
an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall
comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit
may be required in a form acceptable to the Village of Poland prior to the
allowing of discharges to the MS4.
   (j)   Monitoring of Discharges.
      (1)   Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have
storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.
      (2)   Access to Facilities.
         A.   The Village of Poland shall be permitted to enter and inspect
facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access to representatives of the authorized enforcement
agency.
         B.   Facility operators shall allow the Village of Poland ready access
to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling,
examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional
duties as defined by state and federal law.
         C.   The Village of Poland shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
authorized enforcement agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the
facility's storm water discharge.
         D.   The Village of Poland has the right to require the discharger to
install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and
monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper
operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to
measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their
accuracy.
         E.   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to
the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at written or oral request of the Village of Poland and shall not be
replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.
         F.   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Village of Poland access to a
permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this
section. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to
discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if
the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the
permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or
required by this section.
         G.   If the Village of Poland has been refused access to any part of
the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he or she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this
section, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine
inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with the
ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public
health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement
agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.
   (k)   Requirement to Prevent, Control, and Reduce Storm Water Pollutants by
the Use of Best Management Practices. The Village of Poland will adopt
requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any activity, operation,
or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of
storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or
operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their
own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited
materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses
through the use of these structural BMP's. Further, any person responsible for
a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural
and non-structural BMP's to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the
municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions
of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated
with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance
with the provisions of this section. These BMP's shall be part of a storm water
pollution prevention plan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements
of the NPDES permit.
   (l)   Watercourse Protection. Every person owning property through which a
watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part
of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive
vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard
to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.
   (m)   Notification of Spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as
soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for
emergency response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into storm water, the storm drain system,
or water of the U.S. said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the
discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a
release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency
response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the
event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the
authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than
the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed
by written notice addressed and mailed to the Village of Poland within three
business days of the phone notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials
emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator
of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the
discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall
be retained for at least three years.
   (n)   Enforcement.
      (1)   Notice of violation.  Whenever the Village of Poland finds that a
person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this
section, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written
notice of violation to the responsible person.
      (2)   Such notice may require without limitation:
         A.   The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
         B.   The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
         C.   That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease
and desists;
         D.   The abatement or remediation of storm water pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;
         E.   Payment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs;
         F.   The implementation of source control or treatment BMP's. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required,
the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or
restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that, should
the violator fail to remediate or restore within the established deadline, the
work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the
expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.
   (o)   Appeal of notice of violation. Any person receiving a notice of
violation may appeal the determination of the authorized enforcement agency.
The notice of appeal must be received within thirty days from the date of the
notice of violation. Hearing on the appeal before the appropriate authority or
his or her designee shall take place within fifteen days from the date of
receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the municipal authority or
their designee shall be final.
   (p)   Enforcement Measures after Appeal. If the violation has not been
corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in the notice of violation or,
in the event of an appeal, within thirty days of the decision of the municipal
authority upholding the decision of the authorized enforcement agency, then
representatives of the authorized enforcement agency shall enter upon the
subject private property and are authorized to take any and all measures
necessary to abate the violation and/or restore the property. It shall be
unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises
to refuse to allow the governmental agency or designated contractor to enter
upon the premises for the purposes set forth above.
   (q)   Cost of Abatement of the Violation. Within thirty days after abatement
of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of
abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a 
written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within ten days. If
the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision
of the municipal authority or by the expiration of the time in which to file an
appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and
shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any
person violating any of the provisions of this section shall become liable to
the village by reason of such violation. The liability shall be paid in not
more than twelve equal payments. Interest at the rate of six percent per annum
shall be assessed on the balance beginning on the first day following discovery
of the violation.
   (r)   Injunctive Relief. It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any
provision or fail to comply with any of the requirements of this section. If a
person has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this section, the
authorized enforcement agency may petition for a preliminary or permanent
injunction restraining the person from activities which would cause further
violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation of the
violation.
   (s)   Compensatory Action. In lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties,
and remedies authorized by this section, the authorized enforcement agency may
impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain
stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.
   (t)   Violations Deemed a Public Nuisance. In addition to the enforcement
processes and penalties provided, any condition caused or permitted to exist in
violation of any of the provisions of this section is a threat to public
health, safety, and welfare, and is declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be
summarily abated or restored at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action
to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such nuisance maybe
taken.
   (u)   Criminal Prosecution. Any person that has violated or continues to
violate this section shall be liable to criminal prosecution to the fullest

   (a)   If a zoning permit is required in reference to construction, erection,

the Zoning Administrator certifying that the business use, building or other
structure complies with the provisions of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Upon the substantial completion of the construction, erection,
reconstruction, alteration or repair of a building or other structure for which

business days of such denial.
   The Mayor and the Planning Commission Chairperson shall sign for approval of
all replats, including variances.
   (b)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the authority and
responsibility to hear replat variances, where this Zoning Code permits a lot

   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve or deny a replat request upon
review of the replat and the findings of the Planning Commission pertaining to
conformity to this Zoning Code.
   Upon approval of a variance, the Board shall immediately submit such
approval to the Planning Commission to proceed in the usual fashion for replat
requests.

1264.01   COMPOSITION; TERMS.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall be composed of five members:  one
member from the Planning Commission; one member from the Architectural Review
Board; one member of Council; the President of Council; and one Village
resident to be appointed by the Mayor for a four-year term.  The President of
Council, Council member, Planning Commission member and Architectural Review
Board member shall all have terms on the Board co- terminus with their
membership or election to each respective body.  The Village resident Board
member shall be appointed by the Mayor, with the approval of the majority of
Council, to serve a four-year term.  However, the Village resident member's
term may be superseded by a subsequent appointee by the Mayor with the approval
of the majority of Council, regardless of whether such superseding appointment
is the result of a vacancy caused by the initial appointee or the result of
action by the Mayor and Council.  Such subsequent appointment shall be only for
the balance of the present term.  Nothing in this section precludes a Village
resident Board member from serving multiple terms.
   (b)   In the event the designated member for the Board of Zoning Appeals
from the Planning Commission, the Architectural Review Board or Council is
unavailable for a scheduled meeting, and his or her absence would result in
less than the required quorum of four members of the Board being present,
thereby preventing the Board from conducting its business, the unavailable
member shall designate an alternate member from the Planning Commission, the
Architectural Review Board or Council to serve as a member of the Board of
Zoning Appeals for that meeting in his or her place in order to constitute a
quorum.
(Ord. 1106-99.  Passed 7-20-99.)
1264.02   MEETINGS; RECORDS; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall adopt rules necessary to conduct its
affairs in keeping with the provisions of this Zoning Code.  At the first
meeting during the calendar year, the Board shall elect one of its members
Chairperson.  Meetings shall be held at the call of the Chairperson or at such
time as the Board may determine.  All meetings shall be open to the public. 
The Board shall keep a complete record of all its examinations and official
actions and of the votes of each member.  All minutes of the Board meetings
shall be a part of the public record on file at the Village Hall.  A quorum of
four Board members shall be necessary to permit the Board to conduct its
affairs at any meeting.  A majority vote (three or more votes) of the Board
members present at a meeting shall be necessary to reverse, modify or vacate
any order requirement, decision and/or determination of the Zoning
Administrator.  All members present, including the Chairperson, shall
participate in all votes, except those where any such members are precluded
from participating by a conflict of interest.
   (b)   Where a member of the Board of Zoning Appeals is presented with a
potential conflict of interest and fails to acknowledge the conflict and take
appropriate steps to avoid the conflict and/or the appearance of impropriety
potentially associated with it, any member of the Board observing the potential
conflict shall seek an opinion from the Village Solicitor as to the existence
of a potential conflict of interest and the appropriate action to be taken to
avoid the conflict.  Notwithstanding any other provision of these Codified
Ordinances, the proceedings presenting a potential conflict of interest shall
be stayed until the Village Solicitor renders an opinion on the potential
conflict of interest.
   In the event the Village Solicitor determines that a potential conflict of
interest exists, his or her opinion will be binding upon each and every Board
member affected.
   (c)   The provisions of this section concerning conflicts of interest are
not intended to be exclusive and are intended to be supplementary to any and
all other applicable statutes, codes, regulations and rulings upon the subject
of conflicts of interest.
(Ord. 1072-98.  Passed 5-5-98.)
1264.03   POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall call a public hearing for any of the
following reasons:
      (1)   Upon receipt of a written appeal where it is alleged that there is
an error in any order, requirement, decision, interpretation or determination
made by the Zoning Administrator in the administration or enforcement of the
provisions of this Zoning Code;
      (2)   Upon receipt of a written appeal after the disapproval of an
application for a permit by the Architectural Review Board for noncompliance
with the design review criteria;
      (3)   Upon application for a conditional use permit in a district
requiring such a permit according to the procedures set forth in Section
1264.05;
      (4)   Upon application for a zoning or design variance according to the
procedures set forth in Section
1264.04.
   (b)   The applicant shall pay a fee specified by Council upon filing for a
hearing before the Board.  The hearing shall be called within thirty days of
the request.  Notice of the hearing shall appear in a locally distributed
newspaper at least two weeks prior to the hearing.  All adjoining property
owners and others affected by the decision of the Board shall be notified of
the hearing in writing five days prior to the date of the hearing.  The Board
shall hear and determine whether a variance may be granted or a conditional use
permit may be issued.  A decision of the Board shall be made within thirty days
following the hearing.  The Board shall keep or cause to be kept, on file at
the Village Hall, a full public record of all of its proceedings.  This record
may not leave the Village Hall premises and may be duplicated by a Village
secretary upon request with the cost of the duplication being borne by the
requesting party.
   (c)   The Village Council will have the authority to approve or disapprove,
after a public hearing, the decision of the Board of Zoning Appeals with regard
to a variance application filed on behalf of Walgreen's, within 60 days of the
Board decision.
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-12-97; Ord. 1202-03. 
Passed 5-6-03.)
1264.04   ZONING OR DESIGN VARIANCE.
   (a)   A variance from the terms of this Zoning Code shall not be granted by
the Board of Zoning Appeals unless a written application for a variance is
submitted to the Zoning Administrator and the Board of Appeals.  The Board may
grant variances where, because of physical circumstances such as exceptional
narrowness, shallowness, shape, topographic conditions or extraordinary lot
conditions, there is no possibility that the property can be developed in
strict conformity with the provisions of this Zoning Code, and a variance is
therefore necessary to enable the reasonable use of the property, provided that
minimum relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good
and does not substantially impair the intent of this Zoning Code.  No variance
shall be granted unless the Board finds that the requested variance will:
      (1)   Permit only land uses approved for the zoning district in question.
      (2)   Treat special conditions or circumstances peculiar to the lot or
property in question, where strict enforcement of this Zoning Code will result
in unnecessary hardship which has not been self imposed by previous actions in
any way.
      (3)   Grant the applicant enjoyment of his or her substantial property
right and not merely serve as a convenience, profit or special privilege to the
applicant.
      (4)   Be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Zoning
Code and not injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the
public welfare.
      (5)   Be of the least magnitude.
   (b)   If rezoning of the property in question may be proper and would make a
variance unnecessary, the variance should be denied.  No nonconforming use of
neighboring lands, buildings or other structures in the same district, and no
permitted or nonconforming use of lands, buildings or other structures in other
districts, shall be considered grounds for issuance of a variance.  The Board
may attach any condition to the granting of a variance under this section which
it may find necessary to ensure that the intent of this Zoning Code and design
review criteria are observed in all respects.  It is incumbent upon the Board
to make specific findings of fact for the granting or denial of a variance. 
Such findings shall become a part of the public record at the Village Hall and
copies of the same shall be given to each Board member and Council member and
to the applicant. 
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78.)
1264.05   CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS.
   Any person seeking a conditional use permit shall provide the Board of
Zoning Appeals with such material as it may require in addition to the material
required for application for a zoning permit.  The Board shall determine
whether the granting of the requested conditional use permit is authorized by
law and in conformity with the intent of this Zoning Code.  No conditional use
shall be allowed which would change the essential character of the same area;
be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future neighboring uses; create
excessive additional requirements at public cost for public facilities and
services; involve uses, activities, processes, materials, equipment and
conditions of operation which will be detrimental to persons, property or the
general welfare by reason of traffic, noise, smoke, fumes, glare or odors;
create interference with traffic; result in the destruction, loss or damage of
a natural or historic feature of major importance; or in any way be detrimental
to the economic welfare of the community.

is the site of a significant historical event or identified with a person who
contributed significantly to the Village's history, or that is unique for its
location as a familiar and established visual feature of the Village, or that
embodies a particular architectural style or unusual details, or that is the
work of a particular builder or architect.  Such buildings shall generally be
over fifty years of age.
   (b)   “Village Preservation District” means an area that, through its visual
character, has definable educational, social, historical or architectural
significance to the Village and the region. 
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78.)
1266.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Architectural Review Board is to promote and protect the
general welfare of the residents of the Village through:
   (a)   Establishment of criteria that will direct exterior building design
and/or modification, vehicular and pedestrian access, and overall site
planning, in accordance with the design characteristics prevalent in certain
areas of the Village.  These criteria will be directed toward:
      (1)   Building size and scale.
      (2)   Building materials and details.
      (3)   Site development.
      (4)   Interrelationships with other environmental elements such as
adjacent buildings, streets, walkways, landscaping and signage.
      (5)   Enhancement or protection of specific public places or properties.
   (b)   Establishment of specific Village landmarks and Village Preservation
Districts which are of unusual importance to the Village and the surrounding
region by their associated historical events and/or their architectural
significance.
   (c)   Establishment of a design review process, as described below, to
retain the unique qualities of the Village, to promote a continuance of the
Village's scale in new commercial development insofar as is reasonable, and to
increase pedestrian access throughout the Village wherever possible.  This
review process shall cover all new construction, all areas zoned commercial
according to this Zoning Code, and all properties in designated Preservation
Districts or which are Village landmarks, but shall not apply to single-family
dwellings, except those designated as Village landmarks or those within the
boundaries of any Village Preservation District.
   (d)   Encouragement of a public knowledge and understanding of those
elements of the built environment of the Village that constitute its
architectural and historical character.
   (e)   Review of applications for demolition permits for any structures in
any designated Preservation District or which are parts of any Village
landmark.
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-12-97.)
1266.03   MEMBERSHIP; TERMS; VACANCIES.
   (a)   The Architectural Review Board shall consist of seven members

without compensation and shall be qualified by reason of their general
knowledge of architecture and local history.  Members shall be residents of the
Village.  One member shall be chosen from both Council and the Planning
Commission.  All members shall hold office two years.  Upon passage of this
section, three members shall be appointed for one year and four members shall
be appointed for two years.  Members may succeed themselves.  Vacancies shall
be filled by appointment by the Mayor and approved by Council.  Any member not
attending three consecutive regular meetings of the Board may be removed from
the Board by the Mayor.
   (b)   The Village Tree Commissioner shall be an additional voting member of
the Board on all landscaping issues.
(Ord. 1109-99.  Passed 7-20-99.)
1266.04   MEETINGS; RECORDS.
   The Architectural Review Board shall meet at least once per month on a
designated day of the month.  For each meeting, there shall be an agenda
available to the public at least twenty-four hours prior to the meeting.  Four
members of the Board shall constitute a quorum, and four votes are needed for
approval of an application.  Once each year, the Board shall elect a
Chairperson and a Secretary.  The Chairperson or his or her designee shall
prepare the agenda and preside at all meetings or hearings.  The Secretary

(Ord. 949-94.  Passed 1-3-94; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-14-97.)
1266.05   DUTIES; CONFLICTS OF INTEREST.
   The Architectural Review Board shall perform the following duties:
   (a)   Design Review Criteria.
      (1)   The Board shall follow design criteria that will direct its
decisions.  The design criteria are set forth in
Appendix II, following the text of this Zoning Code.  The design criteria shall
be available to the public at cost.  The Board shall require all applicants to
show that submitted projects conform to the design criteria and to describe the
project's probable impact on the proposed site, adjacent properties and the
overall character of the Village.  The Board may amend the criteria as needed
according to the procedures set forth in Section
1268.03.
      (2)   The design criteria for the Village are hereby amended by adding
Elements of Poland's Historic Architectural and Site Character, which are set
forth in
Appendix III, following the text of this Zoning Code, and which shall be used
to clarify the design criteria.
   (b)   Design Review Process.  The Board shall review for approval all new
construction, exterior modification, exterior alteration, addition, relocation
or demolition of any building or other structure or part thereof, provided,
however, that none of the foregoing shall be construed to require approval of
plans relating to any new construction, alteration, addition, relocation or
demolition of any single-family dwelling in the Village other than those
designated as Village landmarks or those within the boundaries of any Village
Preservation District.  All design changes in signage or major pedestrian and
vehicular accessways shall be approved by the Board prior to issuance of a
building or zoning permit.
      (1)   Application for project approval shall be transmitted to the Board
from the Zoning Administrator after his or her approval.  Submission to the
Board shall be made no later than five days prior to the meeting of the Board. 
Submissions shall be in accordance with the requirements of Section
1266.08.
      (2)   The Board shall consider all applications at the meeting following
submission.  If additional information is required, the Board shall so inform
the applicant and may delay a decision until the meeting following submission
of such additional information.  If the Board makes no decision at that time,
and if the application has been properly submitted, the application shall be
deemed approved.  In either case, the applicant shall be notified, in writing,
of the decision of the Board within five days after the decision.  If the Board
disapproves the application, it must, within five days, submit a written
statement to the applicant of the reasons for its disapproval and state the
specific violations of the design review criteria.  The applicant may then
either revise and resubmit the design application or he or she may request a
hearing.  This procedure is set forth in Section
1266.06.
   (c)   Village Landmarks and Village Preservation Districts.  The Board may
designate such Village landmarks and Village Preservation Districts as it deems
proper.  Council shall formally approve all designations according to the
procedures set forth in Section
1268.03.
      (1)   Landmark and District designation recognize the particular
importance of buildings, structures, sites and areas, pointing out their
educational and cultural value to the community.  Such designation promotes
awareness of the local heritage.  All landmarks and Districts shall have
property lines as their boundaries.
      (2)   For each proposed District or landmark, all relevant information
shall be gathered into a public record which shall be made available upon
request.  The record may be amended as further research is completed.  All
proposed Districts or landmarks shall be accepted or changed according to
procedures set forth in Section
1268.03.  The subsequent public hearing shall elaborate the boundaries,
character and importance of the proposed designation.  The proceedings of the
hearing shall become a part of the public record of each landmark and
District.  The Chairperson of the Architectural Review Board shall preside at
all hearings.
      (3)   Upon formal approval by Council, all Village landmarks and Village
Preservation Districts shall be considered official and shall be shown on the
official Zoning Map of the Village.  The Board may propose a change in or the
dissolution of any landmark or District and shall submit such change or
dissolution to Council for its approval according to the procedures set forth
in Section
1268.03.
   (d)   Advisory Duties.  As a part of the efforts of the Board to encourage
public knowledge and understanding of the elements of the built environment of
the Village, the Board may be asked to consult with and act in an advisory
capacity to the Planning Commission or Council.  Its advice shall not be
binding.
   (e)   Demolition Permits.
      (1)   For any Preservation District or Village landmark, before the
Zoning Administrator issues a permit for the demolition of all or a part of a
structure, the Zoning Administrator shall transmit the application for
demolition to the Board for its consideration.  The Board shall require a
statement of the reasons why the building or part of the building is being
considered for demolition.  In the case of demolition in a District, if the
Board finds that demolition would severely damage the character of the
District, and thereby alter the reason for the designation of the District,
then the Board may stop demolition for a period of ninety days.  In the case of
a landmark, if the Board finds that demolition would severely alter the
exterior architectural importance or otherwise affect the reasons upon which
the landmark was designated, the Board may stop demolition for a period of
ninety days.  In the ninety-day period, the property owner and the Board shall
explore all means of protecting the structures from demolition, whether by
adaptive use, remodeling or other means.  If, at the end of ninety days, no
reasonable solution can be found, the permit for demolition shall be issued.
      (2)   Any request for a demolition permit must include a complete
description of the property, including the extent of demolition proposed. 
Plans for the renovation of the existing building and grounds must be approved
by the Architectural Review Board.  In the case of building renovations, a
building permit must be submitted.  R-1 permits which are not landmarks or in a
Village Preservation District may be approved by the Zoning Administrator.  All
other permits must be approved by both the Architectural Review Board and the
Zoning Administrator.
   (f)   Landscaping and Trees.  The Board shall work with the Village Tree
Commissioner, and shall, as provided in the Ohio Revised Code and Section
1024.01 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code, have the authority
to review for approval the landscaping plan, including, but not limited to,
trees, for all new construction or renovation of private property, as well as
to regulate the planting, trimming and preservation of shade trees in streets,
alleys, devil strips, public grounds and places, and to provide for the
planting, removal, trimming and preservation of shade trees and ornamental
shrubbery.  Applications for project approval shall be transmitted to the Board
from the Zoning Administrator, and, in the case of trees, to the Tree
Commissioner, pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter and Section
1024.01 of the Streets, Utilities and Public Services Code.
(Ord. 1109-99.  Passed 7-20-99.)
   (g)   Conflicts of Interest.  Where a member of the Architectural Review
Board is presented with a potential conflict of interest and fails to
acknowledge the conflict and take appropriate steps to avoid the conflict and/
or the appearance of impropriety potentially associated with it, any member of
the Board observing the potential conflict shall seek an opinion from the
Village Solicitor as to the existence of a potential conflict of interest and
the appropriate action to be taken to avoid the conflict.  Notwithstanding any
other provision of these Codified Ordinances, the proceedings presenting a
potential conflict of interest shall be stayed until the Village Solicitor
renders an opinion on the potential conflict of interest.
   In the event the Village Solicitor determines that a potential conflict of
interest exists, his or her opinion will be binding upon each and every Board
member affected.
   The provisions of this section concerning conflicts of interest are not
intended to be exclusive and are intended to be supplementary to any and all
other applicable statutes, codes, regulations and rulings upon the subject of
conflicts of interest.
(Ord. 1072-98.  Passed 5-5-98.)
1266.06   APPEALS.
   (a)   After the refusal of the Architectural Review Board to approve an
application, the aggrieved person may make a written appeal to the Board of
Zoning Appeals, specifying the grounds for the appeal.  Such appeal shall be
made within twenty days after the decision of the Architectural Review Board. 
Upon payment of a fee set by Council, the Board of Appeals will review and rule
on the appeal of the applicant.
   (b)   The appeal shall follow the procedures set forth in Sections
1264.03 and
1264.04.  In the hearing, the applicant has the burden of showing why he or she
is unable to comply with the design review criteria and to show whatever
hardship he or she would incur by not fulfilling the intent of this Zoning
Code.  The full record of the hearing shall become a part of the record of the
Architectural Review Board.
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-12-97.)
1266.07   ENFORCEMENT.
   The Zoning Administrator shall enforce the provisions of this chapter.  No
permit shall be issued for excavation, construction, exterior alteration or
modification, relocation or demolition of any building or other structure or
part thereof in areas covered in this chapter where the plans and
specifications indicate the building would not conform to all the provisions of
this Zoning Code.  The Zoning Administrator may stop any work in which the
letter of this Zoning Code is not being observed.

      (3)   The applicant shall provide samples of the exterior finish
materials.  For minor alterations, photographs, sketches, manufacturer's
descriptions and samples of finish materials may be used.
   (b)   The Board may, within reason, request additional information from the
applicant if it is necessary for the proper application of the design criteria.
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-12-97.)
1266.09   ADVICE OF SPECIALISTS.
   The Architectural Review Board may retain, with Council's permission, a
qualified designer, planner or preservationist to consult with the Board on any
matter set forth in this chapter.  If Village landmarks or Village Preservation
Districts are involved, such a specialist shall be qualified in preservation or
restoration work.  Consultation will be strictly advisory and nonbinding on the
Board or Council.
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-12-97.)

prevent any change that is required for the public safety because of any unsafe
or dangerous condition.

   (a)   Restrictions.  Within the districts established by this Zoning Code,
there exist uses of structures and land which were lawful before this Zoning
Code was passed, but which would be prohibited under the terms of this Zoning
Code.  It is the intent of this Zoning Code to permit these nonconformities to
continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival.  It is
further the intent of this Zoning Code that nonconformities shall not be
extended, expanded or enlarged upon, nor used as grounds for adding other
structures or uses prohibited in the same district.  All nonconforming uses can
be continued subject to the following provisions:
      (1)   No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this Zoning
Code in the district in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended,
constructed, moved or structurally altered except in changing the use of the
structure to a use permitted in the district in which it is located;
      (2)   Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of
adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, unless otherwise restricted by a
court decree, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
building;
      (3)   If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a
structure or structure and land may, upon appeal to the Board of Zoning
Appeals, be changed to another nonconforming use, provided that the Board shall
find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the
district than the existing nonconforming use.  However, the Board shall never
institute a lower use.  In permitting such change, the Board may require
appropriate safeguards and conditions in accord with other provisions of this
Zoning Code;
      (4)   Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which
a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform
to the regulations for the district, and the nonconforming use may not
thereafter be resumed;
      (5)   When a nonconforming use of land, structure, or land and structure
in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for more than twelve months, and
land, structure or land and structure in combination shall not be used, except
in conformity with the regulations of the district in which they are located;
      (6)   A nonconforming use that is damaged by fire or other casualty to
the extent that the cost of reproduction or repair exceeds fifty percent of the
reproduction costs of the structure shall not be resumed except in conformance
with the regulations of the district in which it is located;
      (7)   Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and land in
combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the
nonconforming status of the land.
   (b)   Repairs and Maintenance.  On any nonconforming structure or portion of
a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary
repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or
plumbing, provided that the cubic content existing when it become nonconforming
shall not be increased.  Nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the
strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof
declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public
safety.
   (c)   Conditional Uses Considered Conforming.  Any use which is permitted as
a conditional use in a district under the terms of this Zoning Code shall not
be deemed a nonconforming use in such district, but shall without further
action be considered a conforming use.

1276.01   USES AND RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Intent.  The Residential District One-Planned Unit Development (R1-
PUD) is intended to permit a choice of living environments by allowing a more
useful pattern of open space and recreation areas; a preservation and
utilization of the natural topography and landscaping; a harmony with existing
land use densities, transportation patterns and community facilities; and the
objectives of this Zoning Code.
   (b)   Availability.  With the exception of plans involving nonconforming
uses, the R1-PUD shall only be applied to an area of contiguous real estate
which is wholly owned by a single person and which is two or more acres in
size.  No variance shall be available to the size restriction set forth
herein.  In the case of plans involving properties which are nonconforming uses
where the contiguous real estate is wholly owned by a single person, an R1-PUD
may be approved regardless of land area where the Planning Commission, with the
approval of Council, or Council itself, upon appeal from the Planning
Commission, approves the submitted plan.  Further, the R1-PUD designation shall
only apply after approval, as described in this Zoning Code, by the Planning
Commission, the Architectural Review Board and Council.
   (c)   Permitted Principal Uses.  Single-family dwellings.
   (d)   Conditional Uses.  No conditional uses shall be permitted in an R1-
PUD.
   (e)   Accessory Uses.
      (1)   Garage space of paved parking space with a minimum total of four of
either such spaces per single-family unit;
      (2)   No other accessory uses are permitted in an R1-PUD.
   (f)   Parking.
      (1)   All parking shall be behind the front setback.
      (2)   No parking shall be permitted, except in designated parking spaces
or garages.
      (3)   Parking, outside of a garage, of trucks in excess of three-fourths
of a ton, recreational vehicles, boat trailers, boats, travel trailers and
utility trailers is prohibited.
      (4)   No unlicensed, abandoned, wrecked or dismantled vehicle of any kind
is permitted anywhere outside of an enclosed garage on R1-PUD property.
(Ord. 1013-96.  Passed 6-11-96; Ord. 1047-97.  Passed 8-12-97.)
1276.02   DENSITY, WEIGHT, BULK AND OTHER RESTRICTIONS.
   (a)   Density.
      (1)   Not more than sixty percent of the land comprising the R1-PUD shall
be used for foundations of dwellings and garages.
      (2)   Notwithstanding paragraph (a)(1) hereof, and with the exception of
R1-PUD's which incorporate and eliminate prior nonconforming uses, the number
of single- family dwellings shall not exceed one per each 15,000 square feet of
land within the development.  In the case of R1-PUD's which incorporate
nonconforming uses existing prior to the 1978 Comprehensive Zoning Plan, and
where the incorporation of such nonconforming uses will reduce the density of
families per unit or units per land area, the Planning Commission, as part of
the plan review described in Section
1276.03, may recommend and Council may approve a greater density of single-
family dwellings, but not in any case to exceed fourteen dwellings per acre. 
No variances beyond these density levels shall be permitted under any
circumstance.
   (b)   Required Common Open Space.  Within the tract to be developed on a
planned unit basis, a minimum land area of forty percent of the entire tract
shall be required for use as common open space.  This common open space may
include the front, rear and side setback areas, pedestrian walkways, parkland,
open areas, drainageways, drives, streets, nonenclosed parking areas and
landscaped islands in any parking area.  At least twenty percent of the land
area of the entire tract shall be comprised of lawn and/or landscaped areas. 
Isolated or fragmented pieces of land which do not serve a purely residential
function, such as landscaped islands in parking areas, shall not be included in
calculating said lawn and/or landscaped area.
   (c)   Setback Lines.
      (1)   Front setback lines shall not be less than ten feet.  No building
or any appurtenance thereto shall extend beyond the front setback line.  All
parking is prohibited in front of the front setback line.
      (2)   Side setback lines shall not be less than ten feet.
      (3)   Rear setback lines shall not be less than twenty feet.
   (d)   Height.  Building height shall not exceed thirty-five feet from grade
to the highest point on any structure.  As used herein, the “highest point” on
a structure shall be the highest point on the roof, if a flat roof, the
deckline of a mansard roof, and the mean height between eaves and ridge for
gable, hip and gambrel roofs.  The front foyer or main entrance door shall
determine the grade where any dispute may exist.
   (e)   Variances.  As part of the plan review described in Section
1276.03, the Planning Commission may recommend and Council may approve
variances to the required common open space, setback lines and height
requirements.

   (b)   Planning Commission Review.  The Zoning Administrator shall notify the
Planning Commission Chairperson of the receipt of an R1-PUD proposed plan. 
Upon notification, the Chairperson shall place the R1-PUD proposal on the
Planning Commission agenda for the next regularly scheduled meeting of the
Planning Commission occurring not less than seven days from the Chairperson's
receipt of notice of the proposal.  At the Chairperson's discretion, a special
meeting of the Planning Commission may be scheduled, but, in that case, no
earlier than seven days from the date of mailing or hand delivering notice of
the meeting to the Planning Commission members, whichever occurs later.  The
Planning Commission shall study and review the proposed R1-PUD application to
determine whether all requirements have been satisfied and that the following
specific conditions are fully met:
      (1)   That the R1-PUD District is in conformity with the Comprehensive
Zoning Plan;
      (2)   That the development shall not exceed the maximum density allowed;
      (3)   That the ownership of the real estate is vested in one legal
entity;
      (4)   That the use proposed will not be detrimental to present and
potential surrounding uses, but will have a beneficial effect which could not
be achieved under other zoning districts;
      (5)   That the areas proposed shall be used only as permitted in R1-PUD;
      (6)   That the internal streets, major and minor streets and driveways
that are proposed shall properly interconnect with the surrounding existing
major and minor streets in a manner which will not increase traffic congestion
and which is otherwise in the best interest of the Village;
      (7)   That the minimum common open space area has been designated and
meets the requirements for R1-PUD;
      (8)   That the preliminary PUD plan is consistent with the intent and
purpose of this Zoning Code, to promote public health, safety and the general
welfare of the residents of the Village.
   (c)   Acceptance, Rejection or Modification.  To the extent that the above
criteria have or have not been met to its satisfaction, the Planning Commission
shall either accept, reject or request modification of the proposed plan.
      (1)   If the Planning Commission accepts the proposed plan, it shall
issue a typewritten recommendation, including its findings relative to
subsection (b) hereof, and it shall note its approval, including the date
thereof, on all three copies of the plan and, in turn, shall submit the
recommendation and two copies to the Architectural Review Board for its
approval.
         Notwithstanding Section
1266.05(b) with respect to R-1 dwellings, the review by the Architectural
Review Board shall follow the process set forth in Sections
1266.05(a) and (b) and sections incorporated therein by express reference. 
Actions of the Architectural Review Board shall be submitted to the original
records of the Village.  Findings supporting approval, including restrictions

records of the Village, and the other two copies shall be returned to the owner
of the proposed R1-PUD.  Within thirty days of the meeting at which the
decision to reject the proposed plan occurs, the owner may appeal the rejection
to Council.  The rejection by the Planning Commission will be reversed only by
a three-fourths or greater vote of Council, in which event the proposed R1-PUD
shall be referred to the Architectural Review Board for review in accordance
with paragraph (c)(1) hereof.
      (3)   If the Planning Commission determines that modifications to the
plan are necessary, the nature of the proposed modifications shall be described
in a dated opinion of the Planning Commission.  A copy of that opinion shall be
placed in the permanent records of the Village and another copy shall be
transmitted to the owner.  There shall be no appeal of a request for
modification by the Planning Commission to an R1-PUD plan.  No further action
concerning the plan shall occur until and unless the owner resubmits a modified
plan.
   (d)   Council Action.  After an R1-PUD plan has been approved by both the
Planning Commission and the Architectural Review Board, the findings,
recommendation and plan shall be submitted to Council.  Upon receipt of reports
from the Planning Commission and the Architectural Review Board, Council shall
proceed in the same manner as it would upon receipt of a recommended change to
this Zoning Code, as set forth in Section
1268.03.

1280.01   PURPOSE; SIGN DEFINED.
   The purpose of this chapter is to review and regulate all existing and
proposed signs of any type in order to create a more attractive business
climate, enhance and protect the physical appearance of the community and
preserve the beauty of designated areas.  Furthermore, this chapter is intended
to promote public welfare and to reduce distractions and/or obstructions which
may contribute to safety hazards.
   As used in this chapter, “sign” means a limited display identifying a
business by name and/or the nature of the business.  It may be permanently
fixed to the ground or attached to a building or, in certain cases, it may be a
temporary display that conforms to the spirit and letter of this chapter.

APPENDIX II
DESIGN CRITERIA FOR THE VILLAGE OF POLAND, OHIO
1.   It is the intention of the Design Review Board to place the greatest
possible emphasis on the further development of a village as distinct from a
suburb.  A village gives equal opportunity to pedestrian and motorist alike. 
The heart of every village is it's commercial and business area, with buildings
close to the street easily rubbing elbows with one other, and where adults and
children walk comfortably from one building to the other.  Poland has the
potential to offer a Village center unique in the Youngstown area.  It is the
firm conviction of the Design Review Board that Poland can reverse her recent
commercial suburban sprawl by insisting on a well defined Village streetscape
where building character, building placement and building access are the main
elements of design.
SECTION I.   AREAS OF COVERAGE
These criteria are designed to reflect the visual character of all of the
Village of Poland, Ohio; however, they are specifically intended to apply to
only three specific areas when used in the formal considerations of the Design
Review Board of the Village of Poland:
   1.   All new construction, exterior changes, relocations or demolitions of
any building, structure or part thereof warranting a building permit, excluding
all single-family dwellings not in a Village Preservation District or a
designated Village Landmark.
   2.   The relationship of pedestrian and vehicular access and general site
planning among existing and proposed construction in all areas, excluding
single-family dwellings.
   3.   Design of signage requiring a permit.
SECTION II.   USE OF THE CRITERIA
For each design submitted to the Design Review Board, the applicant shall show
how his or her design responds to all points in each of the following
applicable criteria.  All designs must comply with Section III - GENERAL DESIGN
FEATURES and, in addition, each design must comply with Sections IV, V and/or
VI, as applicable, depending upon the use and location of the design.
SECTION III.   GENERAL DESIGN FEATURES
It is not the intent of these criteria to prevent planners, architects,
landscape architects and other designers from expressing and exploring new
ideas.
III-1.   New design should express its own time and solve its own contemporary
functional problems while maintaining a harmony of materials and proportion and
scale with earlier building character and styles of Poland.
III-2.   In the case of a new building the designer should seek a unity and
coherence with the dignity and prevailing character of a neighborhood.
III-3.   In the case of remodeling or enlargement of an existing building, the
designer should seek a unity and coherence with the dignity and character of
the present structure.  Design defects cause substantial deterioration of the
architectural character of a neighborhood and property devaluation.
III-4.   New design shall avoid arresting and spectacular effects, violent
contrast of materials and colors and a multiplicity or incongruity of details
resulting in a restless and disturbing appearance.
III-5.   New design shall maintain the local taste for simplicity of materials,
using only one principal exterior material, no more than one or two window
sizes and a few simple decorative details; never a smorgasbord of materials or
decorative detailing.
III-6.   Poland buildings define the edges of the public street.  Therefore,
only buildings, not parking, should be on the street edge.  Parking should be
confined to the rear of the building.  The main facade and main entrance should
face the street and be a social part of the public sidewalk and street edge.
SECTION IV.   COMMERCIAL DESIGN
Intent:   To assist developers and guide building and site design in the
commercial area so that a cohesive, active and pleasant shopping, service and
business area will be strengthened and grow in the center of Poland Village.
   For a comparative value, the better model of site planning and general
building design is the South Main Street commercial area.  In this part of the
Village the commercial area changes slowly and comfortably into a residential
area.  This area has particularly noteworthy features which should be retained,
reinforced and repeated.
IV-1.   Maintain the occasional old commercial buildings and use the smaller
scale and tall proportions of the 19th and early 20th century buildings.
IV-2.   Continue the proximity to the street and evenness of setback from the
street.
IV-3.   Include shade trees and shrubbery planting that relieves the hardness
of concrete and asphalt in all designs.
IV-4.   Include the option to walk and bicycle as well as drive to a store.
Other equally important building and site features are the following:
IV-5.   Do not transplant building designs from other obvious historic or
geographic areas not consistent with the design character of Poland, e.g.
American western frontier buildings.
IV-6.   Proportion of height to width and depth:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-26.jpg]
 
   Most old commercial buildings in Poland are tall and narrow to the street. 
When more space is needed, additions are made; but the building is not just
made bigger by increasing all of its dimensions.
IV-7.   Rhythm of bays and/or variations in the planes of the facade:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-28.jpg]
 
   Many buildings have regularly spaced windows and doors that divide a facade
of the building equally into regular repeated bays.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-30.jpg]
 
   On many other Poland buildings, particularly late 19th and 20th century
buildings, the structure is not a perfect rectangle with flat facades, but each
facade pushes out with additions, bay windows, porches, etc., allowing for
varied window placement and adding great variety to each facade.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-32.jpg]
 
   In particularly large buildings, there are regular bay divisions and
variations in the planes of the facade to help break up the large mass of the
building.
IV-8.   Interrelation of design and materials of all visible facades:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-34.jpg]
 
   No old Poland buildings have one fancy "public" facade and the rest plain
and characterless or even windowless.  Windows, materials and details continue
on the sides and back as well as the front when any of these facades are
intended to be seen.
IV-9.   Rhythm of built to unbuilt space:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-36.jpg]
 
   In the older parts of the commercial area, buildings are regularly spaced
along the street, with narrow pedestrian or vehicular access between buildings.
IV-10.   Focus:
   The focus of the commercial area of Poland Village center is the 170-224
intersection.  It needs imposing buildings to organize and focus the town's
commercial activity.
IV-11.   Separate Parking and the Pedestrian:
   Parking and pedestrian access should be designed for the safety of the
pedestrian.  Many neighboring buildings should be accessible from the same
parking area.  A pedestrian can walk from one end of the commercial area to the
other pleasantly and easily.
IV-12.   Public places:
   The commercial area should have public, landscaped places free from vehicles
and easily accessible from several commercial structures.  These places should
add to the character and pleasure of using the commercial area, giving relief
from the harshness of asphalt and concrete.
SECTION V.   RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION COVERED BY THIS ORDINANCE
Intent:   To assist architects and builders to provide new housing for Poland
that continues and maintains the small town visual character of Poland,
reinforcing but also extending those design features that make the Village a
cohesive unit, visually appealing and pleasant to be in.
   New residential building and site designs should be compared to and
interrelate with neighboring structures in the same block or area.  Where no
consistency in examples exists, and few neighboring structures are relevant for
comparison, but the new construction will be visible from public ways,
comparative buildings should be drawn from another neighborhood of Poland
Village with obvious cohesive character.
   The following general design features should be incorporated in new
residential construction:
V-1.   The building as a volume:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-38.jpg]
 
   Poland buildings are not facades along a street, but volumes on a site, seen
from three or even four sides; therefore, all the facades of the building
should interrelate and contain similar design features.
V-2.   Bulk:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-40.jpg]
 
   Poland residential buildings are composed of volumes added together to make
bigger houses.  There seldom is a building with a dimension exceeding 45'.  The
bigger the building, the more rambling it becomes, rather than just having
larger dimensions.
V-3.   Solid to void:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-42.jpg]
 
   In most residential buildings in Poland, neither the windows and doors nor
the solid wall space dominates the appearance of the facade.
V-4.   Roof proportions:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-44.jpg]
 
   In most Poland neighborhoods, there is a distinct proportion that exists
between roofs and building mass.  A few neighborhoods are characterized by a

   Poland houses are usually of two types:  those with similar windows in each
facade, evenly spaced across each facade, in a regular, rhythmic pattern; or
those with windows that vary in size but each facade of the building juts and
recedes, giving varied wall space to each kind of window.
SECTION VI.   VILLAGE PRESERVATION DISTRICTS AND VILLAGE LANDMARKS
Intent:  To encourage interest in and preservation of the old buildings and
neighborhoods of Poland.  The social, historical, educational and architectural
value of these buildings makes them worthy of special care to ensure their
continuance of Poland's character and self-image.  Therefore, owners of these
properties should take every precaution to protect, preserve and maintain their
buildings.
25.   Where documentation exists, the earliest or most historic precedent shall
be followed in the use of materials, window size and placement, doorway
placement, roof style, building bulk and the relation of additions or ells,
signage and out-building design, and other features that add significantly to
the character of the site and the building on it.
(Ord. 710-78.  Passed 9-19-78.)
APPENDIX III
ELEMENTS OF POLAND'S HISTORIC ARCHITECTURAL AND SITE CHARACTER
The following discussion elaborates the most characteristic features of
Poland's older architecture, site planning and street character so that
developers, designers and property owners will understand the separate elements
that go together to make the built character of Poland's oldest neighborhoods. 
Construction and site development dating after 1930 have not been included. 
Elements have been arranged in decreasing order of importance.  Maintenance
should preserve historic elements; repair should make every attempt to
duplicate worn out historic material.  New construction and development should
fit in with existing character, but NEVER SLAVISHLY IMITATE OR MOCK EARLIER
BUILDINGS.
MASS:  Each Poland building is seen as a three-dimensional volume on it's
site.  There are five general forms of these buildings:  ridge to the street,
narrow facade to the street, T, square and bungaloid.
Ridge to the street:    This is the earliest form of building (Stone Tavern). 
It continued in use through the nineteenth century for both commercial and
residential buildings.  It regained really stylish popularity late in the
nineteenth century and early in the twentieth century with renewed interest in
colonial architecture.
(Examples: 214 S. Main Street, 441 S. Main Street, 14 N. Main Street.)

IMAGES/0-0-0-48.jpg]
 
Narrow facade to the street:  This form was most popular in stylish houses and
commercial buildings of the late Federal and Greek Revival period, when a
gabled roof was used.  In the 1850-1880 period, most often a hip or mansard
roof was used.  The doorway is nearly always to one side.
(Examples:  70 N. Main Street, 307 S. Main Street.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-50.jpg]
 
T plan:  This form, where the wing is of equal height and visual importance as
the main structure, is most seen in farmhouses built from the 1860's to the
early twentieth century.
(Examples:  9 E. McKinley Way, 7 Water Street, 725 N. Main Street.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-52.jpg]
 
Square:  These houses, usually important residences of the second half of the
nineteenth century, have facades wider than they are tall, or square facades. 
They usually have center doorways and hip or mansard roofs.
(Examples:  4 Riverside, 24 College St.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-54.jpg]
 
Bungaloid:  These houses of the twentieth century have a low, huddled
appearance, with a one-story main facade and dormered windows.  They are
somewhat square in plan.
(Examples:  22 Water Street, 59 Poland Manor.)
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-56.jpg]
 
STORIES:  All old Poland buildings are one and one-half or two stories high. 
Often, among more stylish buildings, ceilings are over eight feet, even as much
as ten and one-half feet, giving buildings a very tall appearance.  Except for
the contemporary Methodist Church, Poland is notable for having no buildings
whose roof lines act as landmarks for persons approaching Poland.  Poland has
no other steeples, watertowers, belfries, etc.
ROOF FORM:  Nearly all Poland roofs are pitched.  At least to the mid-
nineteenth century, sawn wooden shingles were used on most roofs.  (Never
shakes.)  With better transportation and new manufacturing processes, after the
middle of the nineteenth century, slate shingles and tin-coated iron with
crimped seams were also used.  Poland buildings show much of their character in
the specific details of roof construction, as those illustrated below:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-58.jpg]
 
EXTERIOR MATERIALS:  Most Poland buildings are covered with wooden lap siding
showing from four and one-half inches to six inches to the weather.  Some
structures have flush board siding, which, occasionally, is beaded.  Usually,
it is under a porch, although it also is used on the entire main facade of some
very stylish buildings.  During the late nineteenth century, drop or ship
lapsiding was often used; it gave an appearance of very small exposure.  As
visually important as the exposure of the siding are the corner boards, which
were used on all wooden old Poland buildings.  If wood siding is properly
maintained and painted every five to ten years, it will last well over one
hundred years.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-60.jpg]
 
   Brick was used on Poland's most pretentious buildings.  Most brickwork prior
to the 1860's employed locally made red brick laid in American common bond,
using soft lime mortar. Later, commercially made brick became available.  Wood
construction was never mixed with brick construction except for small details
such as doors and windows, or for a rear kitchen wing.  Little or no fancy
brick work (e.g. quoining) was ever employed in Poland's brick buildings.
   Brick walls, if properly protected, regularly repointed with compatible
mortar, and kept clean, will last well over one hundred years. Re-pointing old,
soft brick with modern hard mortar will eventually destroy the brick wall.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-62.jpg]
 
   Poland only has one building with stone work - - the historically important
and architecturally unique Stone Tavern, which has coursed and uncoursed rubble
sandstone endwalls.
   Aluminum and vinyl siding, with its small corner pieces and overlapping end
joints, covers important architectural details such as entablatures, door and
window casings, corner boards, etc.  Further, a reason for initial application
of aluminum or vinyl siding, water damage within walls and siding, may be
accelerated by the siding because of its water-sealing properties.  Aluminum
siding also dents, dulls and does not paint well.  Vinyl siding burns faster
than wood, producing poisonous fumes.
DOORWAYS:  For most Poland buildings, decorative detail is limited to the
doorway or front porch.  Doorways tend to be simple, bold and rectilinear,
although some houses do have rounded and elliptical fan lights and elaborate
detailing.  Post-1860 houses usually have plain doorways with decorative
emphasis dependent on the front porch.  Typical doorway styles are illustrated
below:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-64.jpg]
 
WINDOWS:  On nearly all Poland buildings, windows are the same size on all
sides of a building; fenestration is regular.  On houses built prior to the
1860's windows are placed far enough from the corner to not interfere with the
structural cornerbraces.  The windows of an ell may be smaller than those of
the main structure.  Some commercial buildings have large display windows along
the street facade.
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-66.jpg]
 
   Window size originally was determined by the size of available panes of
glass.  As glass production improved, pane sizes increased and window sizes
could increase also.  Both the size of the window pane and the size and
proportion of the whole window are critical to the character of a building.
   The windows of old Poland buildings usually have simple exterior casings,
about four and one-half inches to six inches wide, with a casing molding and
drip cap.  The muntin bars of early windows were painted white or the same
light color as the building (usually white).  Late in the nineteenth century,
muntin bars were painted a dark color, so the whole window looked like one pane
of glass.
FOUNDATIONS:  Most nineteenth century Poland buildings have local sandstone
foundations about twenty-four inches tall.  The most distinguished buildings
have fancy, dressed ashlar foundations.  With the introduction of tile and
block foundation material after the turn of the century, foundation heights
became lower.  Foundations were exposed until the 1950's when dense, usually
evergreen, foundation planting became popular.  Foundations need periodic
maintenance.  If stone or block foundations are kept properly pointed and
clean, free from water and plumb, they will last well over one hundred years.

1.   (Example - Village Hall.)      2.  (Example - 121 S. Main Street.)
PORCHES:  Poland houses built between 1860 and 1910 depend on large, front
porches for the focal, decorative detail.  Poland is unusual for having small
wooden porches at the front doorway of many Greek Revival buildings (as the
Kirtland-Hine house).
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/91ab0b9fe89ea5b133fd98562953d9aea0dc46f0/
IMAGES/0-0-0-70.jpg]
 
1.  (Example:  114 E. McKinley Way.)   2. (Examples:  320 N. Main St., 500 S.
Main St.)
Porches need careful maintenance as they are more exposed to weathering than
most other parts of a building.  Whether they are embellished with railings,
brackets, columns or balustrades, both kinds usually are the central design
element of a building.
FRONT STEPS:  Because foundations are so tall, front steps are visually
important.  A stoop is no wider than the doorway.  All originally were wooden
or sandstone.  Brick steps appear to be an early twentieth century style, from
the colonial revival movement.  Concrete steps are, of course, modern.
COLOR:  Building color is remarkably important to the character of a building,
especially considering how easily it can be changed.  In the 1840's Henry Howe
noted that most Poland houses were white.  Greek Revival buildings almost
always were white.  In the 1850's attitudes changed and white became the most
unpopular color for a building.  Instead, houses had two, three or four colors,
all earth tones, that were used to pick out architectural details.  With the
colonial revival movement, early in this century, white again gained popularity
as the most stylish house color.
SITE PLANNING:  As with building character, these features of site character
are organized in order of decreasing visual importance.
BUILDING SETBACK:  Generally, old Poland houses tend to be near the street with
a "dooryard".  The oldest buildings (Stone Tavern, the brick Truesdale house)
are very close to the sidewalk.  Important stylish houses (the Town Hall) are
set back within a yard.  Only those built after the passage of the Zoning
Ordinance have consistent, deep setbacks of forty to fifty feet, as required in
that Ordinance.
SIDEYARD:  Generally, Poland buildings are close together with partial
screening of the view into the backyard.  Few sideyards are totally closed or
screened, neither are backyards open and public.  As with front setbacks,
important houses have wide side yards.
OUTBUILDINGS:  These include barns, carriage houses, sheds, privies, smoke
houses, ice houses, etc.  Every house had at least one out-building, a privy. 
Most had a carriage house.  Generally, outbuildings complemented the main house
in materials, form and color; often they were very stylish.  In most of the
nineteenth century, board and batten siding was frequently used on
outbuildings.  Early buildings often have later outbuildings.  These buildings
are extremely important parts of the visual landscape.  Once they far
outnumbered dwellings.  Today, many have disappeared so that those remaining
are increasingly precious additions to the visual character.
FENCES AND RETAINING WALLS:  Fencing was essential to Village life.  Cows
wandered loose in the early nineteenth century.  Throughout the century, Poland
was a center for the sale of sheep, wool and cattle, all of which came to
market on the hoof.  Early fences, especially around fields and gardens, were
rails, tree stumps, slash, woven branches and dense bushes such as hawthorne. 
Homesites had more stylish fencing, usually vertical or horizontal board
fences, pickets or pales.  When iron became readily available, cast and wrought
iron fencing grew in popularity because of its durability.  Yard fencing
usually was near the sidewalk or street edge.  With frequent painting, fencing
will last well over fifty years.  Little of Poland's fencing has survived.  The
landscape looks very different without it.
   Early retaining walls were built of native sandstone with dry joints.  At
important locations, the stone was dressed and laid in courses.

IMAGES/0-0-0-72.jpg]
 
PLANTING:  As noted in "historic Poland", Poland yards still have many early
plant materials, both deciduous and evergreen.  Throughout the nineteenth
century, Poland was important for its nurseries and hybrid plant development. 
Yard planting of this period was distinguished by a wide variety of plants; by
wild mixing of textures and colors, flowers and smells; and by enthusiasm for
exotic and native plants and vines.  Plants were collected almost like objects
of art to be shown off to all visitors.
YARD FURNITURE:  To complement the planting and add interest to a yard or
garden, most yards by the 1850's included urns, seats and benches, iron or
stone animals, gazebos, greenhouses, or garden houses, even fountains.  These
decorative features have disappeared from most Poland yards.  The most notable
exceptions are the stone bear and playhouse at the Kirtland-Hine house.
   Houses did not have eagles or other plaques, doorway lights or lamp posts
until well into the twentieth century.
WALKWAYS AND PATHS:  Every house had a walk from the front doorway to the
street.  Early in the nineteenth century it was gravel covered or made of broke
bricks (bats).  Later, it was made of cut sandstone or brick.  Concrete walks
are a modern style, as are walks that run to the drive instead of the street.
THE STREET EDGE:
DEVIL STRIP PLANTING:  Poland streets had deciduous shade trees in front of
houses, along the street edge, by the 1840's.  Tree types varied on each lot;
all trees were native; locust, tulip, poplar and other flowering trees were
particularly popular (not flowering shrubs).  When sidewalks were built, the
shade trees provided necessary shade for pedestrians.  By this time, conifers,
particularly larch and hemlocks, were used in devil strip planting, as well as
native deciduous trees.  The edge of the street, since the earliest days, has
been planted in grass.
SIDEWALKS:  Poland's first sidewalks were board walks and paving in front of
heavily used Village buildings, especially taverns.  After 1866, sandstone
sidewalks were laid along at least one side of all Village main streets.  Most
of these original sidewalks have been replaced with concrete walks.  Most
Poland streets laid out from the 1860's up to the 1950's had at least a
sidewalk on one side.  Since the 1950's no new streets included sidewalks. 
(Example: in front of 424 S. Main Street.)
POWER POLES:  Every street in Poland has highly visible power poles on at least
one side.  Occasionally, these poles also have street lights attached to them.
CURBS:  Poland had no curbs on it's streets until this century.  The oldest
curbs are cut sandstone; most curbs are concrete.  Curb placement follows no
pattern, although all commercial streets and properties do have street
curbing.  (Example: in front of 424 S. Main Street.)

1420.01   1998 EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by and for the
Village the Ohio Basic Building Code (OBBC), being particularly the 1998
edition thereof, as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, Department
of Industrial Relations, and as published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio
Administrative Code (OAC), save and except such portions thereof as may be
hereinafter amended or deleted.
1420.02   PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the OBBC, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:
   (a)   Provide uniform minimum standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units, such standards relating to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy;
   (b)   Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)   Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units, which tend to reduce the cost of construction and
erection without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and
security of the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and
without preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or
methods of construction; and
   (d)   Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.
(OAC 4101:2-1-05)
1420.03   APPLICATION.
   The OBBC applies to all buildings except as follows:

International One and Two Family Dwelling Code
EDITOR'S NOTE:  This chapter, previously titled "CABO One and Two Family
Dwelling Code", was re-titled "International One and Two Family Dwelling Code"

(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.02   COMPREHENSIVE STORM WATER MANAGEMENT PLAN.
   The construction site conservation plan developed to meet this chapter will
be coordinated and combined with the riparian and wetland setback plan and the
post-construction water quality plan that are developed for the same site.
These plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
comprehensive storm water management plan for the site. The comprehensive storm
water management plan so developed will serve as the storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES storm water
permit for general construction.
(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.03   PURPOSE.
   The intent of this chapter is to establish consistent technically feasible
and operationally practical standards to achieve a level of storm water
management, and erosion and sediment control that will minimize damage to
public and private property and the degradation of water resources, and will
promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the
Community. This chapter further intends, but is not limited to:
   (a)   Allow development while minimizing increases in downstream flooding,
erosion, and sedimentation.
   (b)   Reduce damage to receiving water resources and drainage systems that
are caused by new development or redevelopment activities;
   (c)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities;
   (d)   Assure that development site owners control the volume and rate of
storm water runoff originating from their property so that surface water and
ground water are protected, soil erosion is controlled, and flooding potential
is not increased;
   (e)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable the natural drainage
characteristics of the building site and minimize the need to construct,
repair, and replace enclosed storm drain systems;
   (f)   Preserve to the maximum extent practicable natural infiltration and
groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that replenishes water
resources, wetlands, and wells;
   (g)   Assure that storm water controls are incorporated into site planning
and design at the earliest possible stage;
   (h)   Prevent unnecessary stripping of vegetation and loss of soil,
especially adjacent to water resources and wetlands;
   (i)   Reduce the need for costly maintenance and repairs to roads,
embankments, sewage systems, ditches, water resources, wetlands, and storm
water management practices that are the result of inadequate soil erosion,
sediment and storm water control;
   (j)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water, erosion and sediment control;
   (k)   Require the construction of storm water management practices that
serve multiple purposes including flood control, soil erosion and sediment
control, and require water quality protection; and encourage such practices
that promote recreation and habitat preservation;
   (l)   Ensure that all storm water management, soil erosion and sediment
control practices are properly designed, constructed, and maintained.

maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate such
nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting therefrom.

five feet in width, or larger if required by the Community Engineer.
   (f)   Flood control or storm drainage easements containing underground
facilities shall have a minimum width of twenty-five feet.
   (g)   The easements shall be restricted against the plantings with woody
growth characteristics, and buildings, fences, walls or any other obstructions
to the free flow of storm water and the movement of inspectors and maintenance
equipment and also restricted against the changing of final grade from that
described by the grading plan.
(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.11   MAINTENANCE.
   Any portion of the permanent drainage and soil erosion systems, including
on-site and off-site storage facilities that are constructed by the owner, will
be continuously maintained into perpetuity.
   (a)   Maintenance Plans. Maintenance plans shall be provided by the
permittee to both the Community Engineer and the post construction operator of
the BMP (including homeowner associations) upon completion of construction
activities and prior to the Community Engineer giving final approval for the
completed construction.
   (b)   Single Family and Multi-family Residential Developments. A homeowners'
association shall be created and placed in title of the affected lands and
shall be continuously responsible for post-construction maintenance and
inspections into perpetuity unless such maintenance and inspections become
officially accepted by the Community.
   (c)   Apartments, Commercial and Industrial Developments. The plans will
clearly state that the owner of the property shall be continuously responsible
for post-construction maintenance and inspections into perpetuity unless the
Community officially accepts such maintenance and inspections.
   (d)   Maintenance Design. All temporary and permanent soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be designed and constructed to minimize
maintenance requirements. Multi-use facilities incorporating assets such as
aesthetics and recreation may be incorporated into the design of the drainage
facilities. All permanent drainage, soil erosion, sediment control, water
quality management systems and BMPs, including on-site and off-site structures
and vegetation that are constructed or planted, must be inspected and
maintained into perpetuity by the responsible party designated in the plans.
Inspections and maintenance will be incorporated periodically throughout the
year to ensure that the facilities are properly operational.
   (e)   Perpetual Maintenance Inspections. One inspection with a written
report will be performed each year. The written report will be given to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each and every year after the Best Management
Practice (BMP) has been completed.
      (1)   Structures that Require a Permit from the Ohio Division of Water. A
written and stamped report from professional engineer on the status of all
structural BMPs that require a permit from the Ohio Department of Natural
Resources (ODNR) Division of Water. This applies to all BMPs that require
permit either at the time of construction or fall under the jurisdiction of the
ODNR Division of Water at any time after construction is completed.
      (2)   Easements. A written report from an inspector on the status of all
storm water management easement for each project shall be submitted to the
Community Engineer by May 1st of each year into, perpetuity. These reports will
document if restricted plantings, fences and structures are on the easement and
will identify the location of the noted easement restriction violations.
      (3)   Best Management Practices (BMPs) That Do Not Have a High Risk for
Loss of Life, Bodily Injury, or Damage to Structures or Infrastructure Related
to Imminent Failure as Determined by the Community Engineer. A written and
stamped report from a professional engineer, landscape architect or certified
professional in erosion and sediment control (CPESC) on the status of permanent
soil erosion, sediment control water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a Potential Loss of Life. A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.12   MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control sediment pollution of water resources, the owner or
person responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards.
   (a)   The plan shall include measures that control the flow of runoff from
disturbed areas so as to prevent soil erosion from occurring.
   (b)   Structural practices shall be used to control erosion and trap
sediment from areas remaining disturbed for more than fourteen days.
   (c)   Sediment barriers. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas shall be
intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent properties and
water resources from sediment. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt
fence shall be placed on a level contour. The relationship between the maximum
drainage areas to silt fence for a particular slope is shown in the table
below.
   Table 1: Silt Fence Applicability
 
Maximum drainage area (in acres) to 100 Range of slope for a particular
linear feet of silt fence            drainage area (in percent)
0.5                                     < 2%
0.25                                    > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                   > 20% but < 50%
 
This does not preclude the use of other sediment barriers designed to control
sheet flow runoff. The total runoff flow treated by a sediment barrier shall
not exceed the design capacity for that sediment barrier. Straw bale barriers
are not acceptable.
   (d)   Storm water diversion practices. Storm water diversion practices shall
be used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes where
practicable. Such practices, which include swales, dikes or berms, pipe slope
drains and diversions, may receive storm water runoff from areas up to ten
acres. Storm water diversion practices alone are not considered a sediment
control practice unless those are used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond.
   (e)   All sediment control practices must be capable of ponding runoff in
order to be considered functional.
   (f)   Clearing and grubbing will be done in two or more phases. The first
phase will include only those locations necessary to install the perimeter soil
erosion, sediment and storm water control BMPs. After the perimeter controls
are in place and functioning, the remaining phase(s) of clearing and grubbing
may continue.
   (g)   Timing of sediment trapping practices. Sediment control practices
shall be functional throughout all phases of up slope earth disturbing
activity. Settling facilities, perimeter controls and other practices intended
to trap sediment shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days
from the start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is permanently restabilized. As construction progresses and
the topography is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing
controls altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
   (h)   Stabilization of denuded areas. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as
specified in the tables below, or according to the Ohio EPA NPDES storm water
permit rules, whichever is most restrictive:
   Table 2: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area requiring permanent stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any areas that will lie dormant for one Within seven days of the most recent
year or more                            disturbance
Any areas within fifty feet of a stream Within two days of reaching final grade
and at final grade
Any other areas at final grade          Within seven days of reaching final
                                        grade within that area
 
   Without using two building permits, the only way that a community can ensure
that this requirement is met is to:
      (1)   First require a copy of the Ohio EPA letter stating the permit
coverage has been transferred. This letter takes Ohio EPA two weeks to process
and mail Since the permit transfer request is to be submitted seven days before
the lot ownership transfer takes place, the selection of this method can
prevent a builder from starting construction for a minimum of fourteen days
after the property transfer takes place.
      (2)   The Community Engineer must inspect the lot to be sure the
temporary seeding has been done. This will add to the builder's delay unless
the Community Engineer inspects the parcel prior to receipt of a copy of the
NPDES permit coverage transfer letter.
   Table 3: Temporary Stabilization
 
Area requiring temporary stabilization  Time frame to apply erosion controls
Any disturbed areas within 50 feet of a Within two days of the most recent
stream and not at final grade           disturbance if the area will remain

                                        Community Engineer. The Community
                                        Engineer shall then inspect the lot to
                                        ensure that the temporary seeding has
                                        been done.
Disturbed areas that will be idle over  Prior to the onset of winter weather
winter
 
Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural instability or
are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization techniques must be
employed.
   (i)   Sediment settling ponds. Storm water runoff that exceeds the design
capacity of sediment barriers and concentrated storm water flows shall pass
through a sediment settling facility.
      (1)   Where storm sewer drainage areas include ten or more acres
disturbed at one time, a temporary (or permanent) sediment settling pond must
be provided until final stabilization of the site. In single-family residential
construction, final stabilization is after the houses are built and permanent
landscaping is done.
         A.   Alternative equivalent controls may be used if the owner can
show, in writing, that the Ohio EPA approved the use alternatives in the (Ohio
EPA NPDES permit for construction activity) Storm water pollution prevention
plan (SWP3) for the site.
         B.   It is recommended that for drainage locations of less than ten
acres, smaller sediment settling basins and/or sediment traps be used.
      (2)   Each facility's storage capacity shall be no less than 67 cubic
yards per acre of total contributing drainage area. The storage volume will be
measured from the bottom of the basin to the top of the primary (principle)
spillway.
      (3)   Permanent storm water management ponds that are designed to trap
sediment during construction shall be designed to provide for a slow release of
sediment-laden water. The draw down time must be at least seventy-two  hours,
or meet the criteria in the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual
whichever is most stringent.
      (4)   The design configuration between inlet(s) and the outlet of
settling ponds must provide at least two units of length for each one unit of
width (> 2:1 length to width ratio).
      (5)   The depth of the sediment settling pond must be less than or equal
to five feet.
      (6)   Sediment must be removed from the sediment settling ponds when the
design capacity has been reduced by forty percent.
      (7)   Public safety, especially as it relates to children, must be
considered in the design. Alternative sediment controls must be used where site
limitations would preclude a safe design.
      (8)   Temporary sediment settling ponds will not be constructed in any
stream channel.
   (j)   Storm sewer inlet protection.
      (1)   All storm sewer inlets that accept water runoff from the
development area shall be protected so that sediment-laden water will not enter
the storm sewer, unless the storm drain system drains to a sediment settling
pond and is exempted in writing by the Community Engineer. In areas where
construction will be ongoing, such as subdivisions, the storm sewer protection
shall be maintained until all up slope areas reach final stabilization, as
determined by the Community Engineer.
      (2)   At the end of this period the site owner shall hydraulically clean
the storm sewers to the satisfaction of the Community Engineer. All sediments
shall be removed from the system and shall not be flushed downstream.
   (k)   Storm sewer and other drainage outlets. All storm sewers, footer
drains, roof gutter drains and all other drains will be outletted at the bottom
of the slope. The slope below the outlet will be able to control the water
being drained through the storm sewer or other drains without causing erosion
of the stream or channel banks or channel bottom or other areas that the water
is outletted on.
   (l)   Working near or crossing streams and wetlands.
      (1)   Construction vehicles shall avoid water resources, wetlands,
riparian areas, and their setbacks. If construction vehicles must cross these
areas during construction, an approved temporary crossing shall be constructed.
Streams, including intermittent streams with a defined bed and banks, shall be
restabilized immediately after in-channel work is completed, interrupted, or
stopped. Erodible materials will not be used in making stream crossings.
      (2)   No soil, rock, debris, or any other material shall be dumped or
placed into a water resource or into such proximity that it may slough, slip,
or erode into a water resource unless such dumping or placing is authorized by
the approving authority and, when applicable, the US Army Corps of Engineers
and Ohio EPA, for such purposes as, but not limited to, constructing bridges,
culverts, and erosion or sediment control structures.
      (3)   If construction activities disturb areas adjacent to streams,
structural practices shall be designed and implemented on site to protect the
adjacent streams from the impacts of sediment runoff.
      (4)   No temporary or permanent sediment controls will be constructed in
a stream channel.
      (5)   Streams and wetland setbacks required by the community will be
implemented. As a minimum a setback of twenty-five feet, as measured from the
ordinary high water mark of the surface water, will be maintained in its
natural state as a permanent buffer.
   (m)   Construction entrance.
      (1)   Measures shall be taken to prevent soil transport onto public
roads, or surfaces where runoff is not checked by sediment controls.
      (2)   Stone with geotextile construction entrance(s) shall be implemented
as required by the Community Engineer and the Ohio EPA. These will be planned
and installed according to the requirements in the most recent edition of the
Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual.
      (3)   Where soil is transported onto a public road surface, the roads
shall be cleaned thoroughly at the end of each day, or more frequently, in
order to ensure public safety. Soil shall be removed from paved surfaces by
shoveling or sweeping. Street washing shall be allowed only after shoveling or
sweeping has removed most of the sediment and street sewer inlet protection is
properly installed unless end of sewer sediment ponds exist and are properly
functioning.
      (4)   Erodible material ramps in streets will not be used to enable
equipment to cross curbs. Non-erosive materials (e.g. wood and stone) can be
used.
   (n)   Unstable soils.
      (1)   Unstable soils will be as determined by the local county soil
survey or by a detailed soils report.
      (2)   The Community Engineer may require detailed soil reports when
deemed necessary.
      (3)   Unstable soils prone to slipping or land sliding shall not be
graded, excavated, filled or have loads imposed upon them unless the work is
performed in accordance with a qualified professional engineer's
recommendations to correct, eliminate, or adequately address the problems.
   (o)   Cut and fill slopes. Cut and fill slopes shall be designed and
constructed in a manner that will minimize erosion and slippage. Consideration
shall be given to the length and steepness of the slope, soil type, up slope
drainage area, groundwater conditions and slope stabilization. The minimum
final unreinforced soil slopes will have a horizontal to vertical ratio of 2:1
(the horizontal will be two times the vertical).
   (p)   Stabilization of outfalls and channels. Outfalls and constructed or
modified channels shall be designed and constructed to withstand the expected
velocity of flow from the planned post-development frequency storm without
eroding. The planned post-construction velocity and flow shall include the
entire contributing watershed.
   (q)   Establishment of permanent vegetation. A permanent vegetative cover
shall be established on denuded areas not otherwise permanently stabilized.
Permanent vegetation shall not be considered established until ground cover is
achieved which, in the opinion of the Community Engineer, has eighty percent
vegetative density over the entire disturbed area and provides adequate cover,
and is mature enough to satisfactorily control soil erosion and survive adverse
weather conditions.
   (r)   Disposition of temporary practices. All temporary soil erosion and
sediment control practices shall be disposed of immediately after final site
stabilization is achieved or after the temporary practices are no longer
needed, unless otherwise required by the Community Engineer. Trapped sediment
shall be permanently stabilized to prevent further erosion. The construction
maintenance guarantee shall not be released by the Community until all
temporary soil erosion and sediment control practices that are no longer needed
have been removed, properly disposed of and any trapped sediment has been
stabilized.
   (s)   Underground utility construction. The construction of underground
utility lines, pipes, etc. shall be subject to the following criteria:
      (1)   Trenches shall remain open for no more than five days.
      (2)   There shall be no turbid discharges to surface waters resulting
from dewatering activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it
must pass through a sediment settling pond or other equally effective sediment
control device, prior to being discharged from the construction site or to
waters of the state.
      (3)   When discharging clean ground water care must be taken to ensure
that it does not become pollutant laden by crossing over disturbed soils or
other pollutant sources.
   (t)   Inspections.
      (1)   If inspections or other information indicates a control has been
used inappropriately or incorrectly or it has failed, it must be replaced or
modified for the site conditions.
      (2)   The owner of the development area shall have the site inspected for
soil erosion, sediment control and other environmental concerns every seven
calendar days, and within twenty-four hours of a 0.5 inch or greater rainfall
event until the Community Engineer certifies the site as being stable. The
Community Engineer certification does not relieve the permittee from meeting
the Ohio EPA NPDES inspection requirements.
      (3)   The owner, or his designated representative, shall keep a written
log of each inspection and any subsequent improvements to the soil erosion,
sediment control or other environmental controls. The inspections shall include
the date of the inspection, the name of the inspector, weather conditions, and
the actions needed to correct the identified problems.
      (4)   The inspection log will include the date and actions taken to
correct problems noted in past inspection logs. Requiring the owner's
inspections to be documented and turned into the Community Engineer will give
the Community the information it needs to see if there are problems on the site
and to insure that those problems are being taken care of by the owner with a
minimum of Community time and expense.
      (5)   If the construction site is subject to Ohio EPA's National
Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit for construction
activity, a copy of all of the required inspection sheets will be submitted to
the Community Engineer within three working days of the date that the
inspection was conducted.
      (6)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of, or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (7)   Erosion and sediment controls identified in the storm water
pollution prevention plan shall be observed to ensure that they are operating
correctly.
      (8)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to ascertain whether,
erosion and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant
impacts to the receiving waters.
      (9)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (10)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of
repair or maintenance, with the exception of sediment settling ponds, it must
be repaired or maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment
settling ponds must be repaired or maintained within ten days of the
inspection.
      (11)   If any inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform
its intended function and that another, more appropriate control practice is
required, the construction site conservation plan must be amended and the new
control practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
      (12)   If the inspection reveals that a control practice has not been
implemented in the time required by this chapter it must be installed within
ten days from the date of inspection.
      (13)   If the inspection reveals that a planned control practice is not
needed, the record must contain a statement of explanation as to why the
control practice is not needed.
   (u)   Control of materials and debris. Site management practices shall be
implemented to prevent toxic materials, hazardous materials, or other debris
from entering the Community's and state's water resources or wetlands. These
practices shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
      (1)   A covered dumpster shall be made available for the proper disposal
of construction site waste materials, garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum
and etc. A second covered dumpster will be provided for the proper disposal of
toxic and hazardous wastes.
      (2)   The washing of excess concrete material into a street, catch basin,
or other public facility or natural resource shall not occur. A designated area
for concrete washouts shall be made available and used for all concrete
washouts.
      (3)   All fuel tanks and drums shall be stored in a marked storage area.
A dike shall be constructed around this storage area with a minimum capacity
equal to 110 percent of the volume of the largest container in the storage
area. All additional requirements of the local fire authority must be followed.
If the fuel tanks have a self-contained “dike,” the plug will be kept in the
“dike” tank at all times.
      (4)   Any toxic or hazardous wastes and/or contaminated soils must be
disposed of according to all applicable environmental laws and statutes. Local
health districts and Ohio EPA can provide guidance on these issues.
      (5)   On a site with a prior industrial land use or a site that is
contaminated with gasoline, fuel oil, hydrocarbon based chemicals or other Ohio
EPA regulated contaminates, the storm water is considered wastewater. A permit
from Ohio EPA is required to address these sites.
      (6)   Proper permits shall be obtained for development projects on solid
waste landfill sites.
      (7)   Paint, paint washing liquids, excess paints and other paint wastes
are considered solid wastes and shall be disposed of in accordance with
applicable state regulations. Appropriate handling of these wastes shall occur
at the site so as to prevent the discharge of these wastes into surface or
ground waters.
         A.   Water based paint washing liquids and small quantities of excess
water based paints may be disposed of by flushing down a connected sanitary
sewer but may not be disposed of in an on-lot disposal system.
         B.   All other paints, paint thinners, and paint cleaning materials
will be disposed of in the site's hazardous waste disposal dumpster.
      (8)   Restroom facilities will be provided for site workers at all times
that workers are present on the site and during all phases of the construction.
      (9)   All required permits from appropriate federal, state, or local
agencies are required to develop land with a previous industrial or commercial
use or another use that may have led to soil contamination by a regulated
pollutant.
   (v)   Pre-winter stabilization. If the development area will, or is planned
to remain, active through the winter months, the owner of the development area
shall hold a pre-winter stabilization meeting. The meeting will be held before
October 1st. The owner shall invite the operator, developer, engineer,
contractor, Community Engineer and anyone else requested by the Community
Engineer to the meeting.
   (w)   Storm water basins.
      (1)   Pool Geometry. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three (3) times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment. The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains. Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves. Both the storm water management and water
quality basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be located
inside the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be operated in a
safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the valves shall be
fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying official shall attest
to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the handwheel shall be
chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway. Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving
the county. Each principal spillway shall have the capacity to pass the 100-
year design storm flow. The inlet or riser size for the pipe drops shall be
designed so that the flow through the structure goes from weir flow control to
pipe flow control without going into orifice control in the riser. The crest
elevation of the primary spillway shall be no less than one foot below the
emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe is required and a removable trash
rack shall be installed at each location. Anti-seep collars shall be provided
for all pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (6)   Emergency spillway. An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall convey flood flows
safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in accordance with NRCS
standards and specifications for the office serving the local county. Emergency
spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity unless exempted in
writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments. Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features.
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of three percent, which
extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum
of twenty-five feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and
maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may
be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water
pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than 3:1 (three feet horizontal for every one foot
vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of fifteen inches below
the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to
prevent access to the deeper water pool.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than 2:1 (two feet horizontal for every one
foot vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards.
            6.   Side slopes getting to the pond shall not exceed 3:1 (three to
one) and shall terminate on a safety bench.
            7.   Soil erosion and sediment control practices used to satisfy
these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the current
edition of the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide for the local county or the Ohio EPA, which ever is most
stringent.
   (x)   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the right
of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional, more stringent
requirements, nor shall the standards limit the right of the Community
Engineer  to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
   (y)   Soil limitations shall be determined by using the current edition of
the county soil survey written by the NRCS, USDA.
   (z)   Methods for controlling increases in storm water runoff peaks and
volumes may include, but are not limited to:
      (1)   Retarding flow velocities by increasing friction; for example,
grassed road ditches rather than paved street gutters where practical,
discharging roof water to vegetated areas, or grass and rock-lined drainage
channels.
      (2)   Grading and use of grade control structures to provide a level of
control in flow paths and stream gradients.
      (3)   Induced infiltration of increased storm water runoff into soil,
where practical; for example, constructing special infiltration areas where
soils are suitable, retaining topsoil for all areas to be vegetated, or
providing good infiltration areas with proper emergency overflow facilities.
      (4)   Provisions for detention and retention, for example, permanent
retention ponds and lakes, dry detention basins, and subsurface detention
tanks.
(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.13   STREAM CHANNEL AND FLOODPLAIN EROSION DESIGN CRITERIA.
   (a)   Runoff Rate. The peak runoff rate from the development area shall not
be greater after development than it was before development. The applicant
shall provide calculations proving no increase in the runoff rates from the
one, two, five, ten, twenty-five, fifty and 100 year storms.
   (b)   Runoff Volume. Increases in the runoff volume shall be offset by
further restricting runoff rates. Based on the increase in runoff volume, the
applicant shall determine the critical storm for the development area. The
runoff rate from the critical storm shall be restricted to the one year pre-
development storm runoff rate. The critical storm shall be calculated as
follows:
      (1)   Determine the total volume of runoff from a one-year frequency,
twenty-four hour storm, occurring on the development area before and after
development.
      (2)   From the volumes in division (a) determine the percent of increase
in volume of runoff due to development according to the equation (Q after
divided by the Q before) X 100 and, using this percentage, select the critical
storm from this table:
   Table 4: Critical Storm Selection
 
The Percentage Increase in Volume of Runoff Is:
Equal to or  And Less Than The 24-Hour “Critical Storm” For Discharge Will Be
Greater than
0            10            1 Year
10           20            2 Years
 
 
The Percentage Increase in Volume of Runoff Is:
Equal to or  And Less Than The 24-Hour “Critical Storm” For Discharge Will Be
Greater than
20           50            5 Years
50           100           10 Years
100          250           25 Years
250          500           50 Years
500          --            100 Years
 
   (c)   Detention Or Retention Basin Exemption For Redevelopment Or For
Expansion Of Existing Facilities.
      (1)   For any development regulated by this chapter, the construction of
a detention or retention basin may not be required for the development if the
post-development peak discharge for a 100 year frequency twenty-four hour storm
increases the existing peak discharge by one cubic foot per second or less
using the TR-55 method of calculation or other method approved by the Community
Engineer. The Community Engineer can waive this requirement if existing storm
sewers and drainage structures can safely handle the expected increase in flow.
      (2)   Only one exemption will be allowed per parcel. Any subsequent
expansion must provide for detention or retention and must include the
previously exempted area.
   (d)   Practical Alternatives. Where the Community Engineer determines that
site constraints exist in a manner that compromises the intent of this chapter
to improve the management of storm water runoff as established in this section,
practical alternatives may be used to result in an improvement of water quality
and/or a reduction of storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping
with the intent and likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be
required to meet the objectives of this section. When possible, all practical
alternatives shall be implemented within the drainage area of the proposed
development project. Practical alternatives can include, but are not limited
to:
      (1)   Fees shall be paid in an amount specified by the Community
Engineer. These fees shall be applied by the Community to storm water
management practices that reduce existing storm water runoff.
      (2)   Implementation of off-site storm water management practices.
      (3)   Watershed or stream restoration.
      (4)   Retrofitting of an existing storm water management practice.
      (5)   Other practices approved by the Community Engineer in keeping-with
the intent of this section.

be followed. Proof of compliance with the Ohio Dam Safety Law administered by
the ODNR Division of Water shall be, but is not limited to, a copy of the ODNR
Division of Water permit number or a copy of the project approval letter from
the ODNR Division of Water or a letter from the site owner explaining why the
Ohio Dam Safety Law is not applicable. The written proof will be provided to
the Community Engineer before a construction permit will be issued.
   (b)   NPDES Permits. The provisions of the national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permits, issued by the Ohio EPA, shall be followed.
Proof of compliance shall be, but is not limited to, a copy of the Ohio EPA
NPDES permit number or a letter from the site owner explaining why the NPDES
permit is not applicable. The written proof will be provided to the Community
Engineer before a construction permit will be issued.
   (c)   Federal And State Wetland Permits. The provisions of the U.S. Army
Corps of Engineers dredge and fill permits for federally-protected wetlands
shall be followed. The provisions of Ohio EPA's isolated wetlands permits shall
also be followed. Wetlands and other waters of the United States shall be
delineated by protocols accepted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the
Ohio EPA at the time of the application of this chapter. Written proof of
compliance with both permit programs will be provided to the Community Engineer
before a construction permit will be issued. Proof of compliance shall be, but
is not limited to, the following:

pursuant to these regulations, or knowingly use or cause or permit the use of
any lands in violation of these regulations or in violation of any permit
granted under these regulations.
(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.16   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   All permanent storm water, soil erosion, other wastes control, and water
quality practices not specifically waived by the Community shall be constructed
prior to the granting of the final plat approval. Upon the request of the
owner, the Community may defer the construction or installation of a permanent
storm water, soil erosion, sediment, or other wastes control or water quality
practice prior to the approval of the final plat where, in the Community
Engineer's judgment, such proper construction or installation is not
immediately necessary for the protection of the public health and safety; and
where the prior installation or construction of such improvement would
constitute an undue hardship on the owner because in the case of new vegetation
or weather conditions, or because in the case of concrete, building
construction could cause cracking and excessive wear and tear on new
structures. In such event, the Community shall require a security bond, escrow
account, certified check or cash to guarantee that such deferred improvements
will be properly constructed or installed within an agreed specified time, but
not to exceed six months after the filing of such final plat. The owner will
provide a maintenance guarantee for all permanent improvements, and soil
erosion, wastes controls, and water quality practices. The Community shall
require a security bond, escrow account, certified check or cash to guarantee
that the planned temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes controls and water quality practices will be constructed and removed in
a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer.
   (a)    The Guarantee. The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The security bond,
escrow account, verified check or cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in the Ohio R.C. Chapter 711.101.
      (1)   Security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or Review Boards.
      (2)   No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a security
bond, escrow account, verified check or cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this chapter, and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for the
development area fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be released only
after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
      (3)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
construction site conservation plan having been approved by the Community
Engineer.
   (b)   Performance Guarantee. The furnishing of a performance guarantee will
be maintained in an amount of not less than 120 percent of the estimate
approved by the Community Engineer, of installation of the deferred
improvements.
   (c)   Maintenance Guarantee. The maintenance guarantee shall be maintained
for a period of not less than two years after final acceptance of the storm
water, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control practices in an amount
equal to twenty percent of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer, of
the construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension. The Community Engineer may extend for cause the time
allowed for the installation of the improvements for which the performance
guarantee has been provided with the receipt of a written request from the
owner.
   (e)   Completion. Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent, soil erosion, sediment, and other wastes control
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment, and other
wastes control practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection. The Community will not release the security bond, escrow
account, verified check or cash guarantee until the Community Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed item(s) have been completed
and/or removed.
   (g)   Slow Release Devices. Performance and maintenance guarantees will be
maintained on the temporary sediment removal slow release devices installed in
detention and retention basins until the entire site has reached final soil
stabilization. Final stabilization in single-family residential developments is
when ninety percent of the homes are constructed with their lawns completely
installed and any remaining unbuilt lots having been permanently stabilized
with a uniform ground cover at a growth density of eighty percent or better.
   (h)   Release. The construction maintenance guarantee shall not be released
by the Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
(Ord. 1356-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1482.17   APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR CONSTRUCTION CONSERVATION PLANS (CCP).
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the post-construction water quality,
riparian setback and wetland setback plans that have also been developed for
the site.
   (b)   (1)   Plans developed by the site owners and approved by the Community
in accordance with this chapter do not relieve the site owner of responsibility
for obtaining and complying with all other necessary permits and/or approvals
from federal, state, county, and local agencies and departments. If
requirements vary, the most stringent requirement shall be followed. Plans
submitted to the Community Engineer for review and approval, shall be
accompanied by all other required permits and documentation relevant to the
project, including but not limited to the permits required and issued by the US
Army Corps of Engineers, Ohio EPA and ODNR Division of Water.
      (2)   If the Community will be requiring that the local soil and water
conservation district (SWCD) review the plans, the Community should first
discuss this issue and how to implement the plan reviews with the local SWCD.
It should be noted that only the Ohio EPA and the local communities can state
that any plans or activities meet their regulations and rules.
   (c)   The application must include a letter or report from the local county
SWCD that states that the construction site conservation plan, the riparian and
wetland setback plan and the post-construction water quality plan have been
reviewed for consistency with Ohio EPA and local regulations.
   (d)   Five sets of the plans and necessary data required by this regulation
shall be submitted to the Community Engineer with text material being submitted
on eight and one- half by eleven inch paper and drawings on no larger than
twenty-four inch by thirty-six inch sized paper. Submittals shall include:
      (1)   At the preliminary plan approval request, the preliminary plans
only need to show all of the following existing and planned features: streams,
water bodies, wetlands, riparian and wetland setback areas, permanent BMPs and
storm water management detention and retention basins.

   The post-construction water quality plan developed to meet this chapter will
be coordinated and combined with the riparian and wetland setback plan and the
construction site conservation plan that are developed for the same site. These
plans will be titled and numbered in one consecutive sequence to make a
comprehensive storm water management plan for the site. The comprehensive storm
water management plan so developed will serve as the storm water pollution
prevention plan (SWP3) required by Ohio EPA as part of the NPDES storm water
permit for general construction.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.03   PURPOSE.

   (a)   Allow development while reducing damage to receiving water resources
and drainage systems that may be caused by new development or redevelopment
activities.
   (b)   Protect and maintain the receiving stream's physical, chemical,
biological characteristics and stream functions.
   (c)   Provide perpetual management of storm water runoff quality and
quantity.
   (d)   Establish consistent technically feasible and operationally practical
standards to achieve a level of storm water quantity and quality control that
will minimize damage to public and private property and degradation of water
resources, and will promote and maintain the health, safety, and welfare of the
residents of the Community.
   (e)   Control storm water runoff resulting from soil disturbing activities.
   (f)   Preserve, to the maximum extent practicable (MEP), the natural
drainage characteristics of the building site.

infiltration and groundwater recharge, and maintain subsurface flow that
replenishes water resources, wetlands, and wells.
   (h)   Assure that storm water quality controls are incorporated into site
planning and design at the earliest possible stage.
   (i)   Reduce the need for costly treatment and mitigation for the damage to
and loss of water resources that are the result of inadequate storm water
quality control.
   (j)   Reduce the long-term expense of remedial projects needed to address
problems caused by inadequate storm water quality control.
   (k)   Require the incorporation of water quality protection that encourages
and promotes habitat preservation into the construction of storm water
management practices.
   (l)   Ensure that all storm water quality practices are properly designed,
constructed, and maintained.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.04   DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.

imposed or required by other Community provisions of law, ordinance, contract
or deed, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail.
   (b)   If a court of competent jurisdiction declares any clause, section, or
provision of this chapter invalid or unconstitutional, the validity of the
remainder shall not be affected thereby.
   (c)   This chapter shall not be construed as authorizing any person to
maintain a private or public nuisance on their property. Compliance with the
provisions of this chapter shall not be a defense in any action to abate such
nuisance.
   (d)   Failure of the Community to observe or recognize hazardous or
unsightly conditions or to recommend corrective measures shall not relieve the
owner from the responsibility for the condition or damage resulting therefrom,
and shall not result in the Community, its officers, employees, or agents being
responsible for any condition or damage resulting there from.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.06   EFFECTIVE DATE.
   This chapter and its regulations shall become effective upon their passage.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.07   SCOPE.
   This chapter applies to development areas having new or relocated projects
involving highways, underground cables, pipelines, subdivisions, industrial
projects, commercial projects, building activities on farms, redevelopment of
urban areas and all other land uses not specifically exempted. This chapter
does not apply to:
   (a)   Land-disturbing activities related to producing agricultural crops or
silviculture operations regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Pollution
Abatement Rules (1501: 15-03-01 to 1501: 15-03-09 of the Ohio Administrative
Code) and existing at the time of passage of this chapter.
   (b)   Strip mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter 1513 and
existing at the time of passage of this chapter.
   (c)   Surface mining operations regulated by Ohio R.C. Chapter 1514 and
existing at the time of passage of this chapter.
   (d)   Linear construction projects (e.g. pipeline or utility line
installation) which do not result in the installation of impervious surface and
are independent of other construction projects (not part of a larger common
plan of development or sale). However, linear construction projects must be
designed to minimize the number of stream crossings and the width of
disturbance.
   (e)   Transportation projects that are subject to industry specific Ohio EPA
rules are exempt from these rules.
   (f)   It is not the role of the Community to point out each and every part
of the rules and how to implement them on the individual job sites. It is the
project owner's responsibility to be proactive in meeting the intent, purpose
and requirements of these regulations.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.08   CONSULTATIONS.
   In implementing these regulations the Community engineer or other Community
officials may consult with the local county SWCD, state and federal agencies
and other technical experts as necessary. Any costs associated with such
consultations may be assessed to the applicant or his or her designated
representative.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.09   POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY CONTROL PLAN.
   In order to control post-construction water quality damage and damage to
public and private lands, the owner of each development area shall be
responsible for developing a post-construction storm water management plan.
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the construction site conservation
plan and the riparian setback and wetland setback plans that are also developed
for the site.
   (b)   This plan will contain a description of controls appropriate for each
construction operation covered by these regulations, and the operator will
implement such controls in a timely manner.
   (c)   The BMPs used to satisfy the condition of these regulations shall meet
the standards and specifications in the current edition of the Ohio Rain Water
and Land Development manual, ODOT post-construction storm water standards, or
other manual that is acceptable to the community engineer or Ohio EPA.
   (d)   The plan must make use of the practices that preserve the existing
natural condition to the maximum extent practicable (MEP).
   (e)   To meet the post-construction requirements of this regulation, the
post-construction water quality plan must contain a description of the post-
construction best management practices (BMPs) that will be installed during
construction for the site and the rationale for their selection. The rationale
must address the anticipated impacts on the channel and floodplain morphology,
hydrology, and water quality.
   (f)   This plan will identify the person or entity responsible for continued
maintenance of all vegetative and/or mechanical BMPs for both the construction
and post-construction phases of the development.
   (g)   Long-term maintenance requirements and schedules of all BMPs for both
the construction and post-construction phases of the development will be
identified.
   (h)   This plan will contain long-term maintenance inspection schedules,
including the printed name and contact point of the post-construction landowner
(e.g., president of the homeowners association, store manager, apartment
complex manager, etc.).
   (i)   This plan will identify the person or entity financially responsible
for maintaining the permanent inspection and maintenance of permanent storm
water conveyance and storage structures and other conservation practices.
   (j)   The method of ensuring that funding will be available to conduct the
long-term maintenance and inspections of all permanent storm water, soil
erosion and sediment control and water quality practices will be identified.
   (k)   (1)   The post-construction plan will also contain the following
information depending on the size of the development sites as well as any
additional information required by the Community engineer.
      (2)   Development sites smaller than five acres. A development site that
will disturb one or more, but less than five acres of land and is not a part of
a larger common plan of development or sale which will disturb five or more
acres of land shall identify:
         A.   Storm Water Issues. A statement as to how the decreased storm
water quality that will be caused by the planned development project will be
handled.
         B.   Structural BMPs. Structural (designed) post-construction storm
water treatment practices shall be incorporated into the permanent drainage
system for the site.
         C.   Property Sized BMPs. The BMP(s) chosen must be sized to treat the
water quality volume (WQ) and ensure compliance with Ohio's water quality
standards in OAC Chapter 3745-1. The WQ shall be equivalent to the volume of
runoff from a 0.75 inch rainfall and shall be determined according to one of
the two following methods:
            1.   Through a site hydrologic study approved by the local
municipal permitting authority that uses continuous hydrologic simulation and
local long-term hourly precipitation records, or
            2.   Using the following equation:
               WQ = C * P * A/12 where:
                  WQ = water quality volume in acre-feet
                  C = runoff coefficient appropriate for storms less than one
inch (see Table 1)
                  P = 0.75 inch precipitation depth
                  A = area draining into the BMP in acres
   Table 1 Runoff Coefficients Based on the Type of Land Use
 
Land Use                                           Runoff Coefficient
Industrial & Commercial                            0.8
High Density Residential (8 dwellings/acre)        0.5
Medium Density Residential (4 to 8 dwellings/acre) 0.4
Low Density Residential (<4 dwellings/acre)        0.3
Open Space and Recreational Areas                  0.2
 
         D.   Where the land use will be mixed, the runoff coefficient should
be calculated using a weighted average. For example, if sixty percent of the
contributing drainage area to the storm water treatment structure is Low
Density Residential, thirty percent is High Density Residential, and ten
percent is Open Space, the runoff coefficient is calculated as follows: (0.6)
(0.3) + (0.3)(0.5) + (0.1)(0.2) = 0.35.
         E.   An additional volume equal to twenty percent of the WQ shall be
incorporated into the BMP for sediment storage and/or reduced infiltration
capacity. The BMPs will be designed according to the methodology included in
the Ohio Rainwater and Land Development manual, ODOT post-construction storm
water standards, or other manual that is acceptable to Ohio EPA.
         F.   BMPs shall be designed such that the drain time is long enough to
provide treatment, but short enough to provide storage available for successive
rainfall events as described in Table 2 below.
   Table 2: Target Draw Down (Drain) Times for Structural Post-Construction
Treatment Control Practices
 
Best Management Practice                    Drain Time of WQ
Infiltration                                14 – 18 hours
Vegetated Swale and Filter Strip            24 hours
Extended Detention Basin (Dry Basins)       48 hours
Retention Basin (Wet Basins)*               24 hours
Constructed Wetlands (above permanent pool) 24 hours
Media Filtration, Bioretention              40 hours
*Provide both a permanent pool and extended detention volume above the
permanent pool, each sized at 0.75 WQ.
 
         G.   The owner may request approval from the Community Engineer to use
alternative structural post-construction BMPs if the owner can demonstrate, in
a way that is acceptable to Ohio EPA rules and regulations, that the
alternative BMPs are equivalent in effectiveness to those listed in Table 2
above. The use of alternative or vendor supplied post-construction BMPs should
be limited to redevelopment projects where justification is provided that the
traditional BMPs in Table 2 are technically and economically infeasible.
         H.   Construction activities shall be exempt from this condition if it
can be demonstrated that the WQ is provided within an existing structural post-
construction BMP that is part of a larger common plan of development or sale or
if structural post-construction BMPs are addressed in a regional or local storm
water management plan.
         I.   For redevelopment projects (i.e., developments on previously
developed property), post-construction practices shall either ensure a twenty
percent  net reduction of the site impervious area, provide for treatment of at
least twenty percent of the WQ, or a combination of the two.
         J.   Site Description.
            1.   The prior land uses of the site.
            2.   The nature and type of construction activity (e.g., low
density residential, shopping mall, highway, etc.).
            3.   Total area of the site and the area that is expected to be
disturbed (i.e., grubbing, clearing, excavating, filling or grading, including
off-site borrow, fill or spoil areas and off-site utility installation areas).
            4.   Amount of the impervious area and percent imperviousness
created by the construction activity.
            5.   Name and/or location of the immediate receiving stream or
surface water(s) and the first subsequent named receiving water and the major

soil erosion, sediment control, water quality management systems and the status
of the related easements shall be submitted to the Community Engineer by May
1st of each year into perpetuity.
      (4)   BMPs that have a potential for loss of life. A written and stamped
report covering the status of all BMPs that have a potential for loss of life,
bodily injury, or damage to structures or infrastructure will be prepared by a
professional engineer or other individual possessing a valid state license that
authorizes them to design the same type of BMP for construction.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.12   MINIMUM STANDARDS.
   In order to control pollution of water resources, the owner or person
responsible for the development area shall use conservation planning and
practices to maintain the level of conservation established in the following
standards:
   (a)   Standards and Specifications. Post-construction runoff practices used
to satisfy these standards shall meet the standards and specifications in the
current edition of the Rainwater and Land Development manual, NRCS Field Office
Technical Guide or the local county, or the Ohio EPA, whichever is most
stringent.
   (b)   Water Quality Basins.
      (1)   Pool Geometry. The minimum length-to-width ratio for the pond is 3:
1 (the length will be three times the width).
      (2)   Riser in Embankment. The riser shall be located within the
embankment for purposes of maintenance access. Access to the riser will be by
manholes.
      (3)   Water Drains. Each retention basin shall have a drainpipe that can
completely drain the pond. The drain shall have an elbow within the pond to
prevent sediment deposition from plugging the drain.
      (4)   Adjustable Gate Valves. Both the water quality and the storm water
management basin drains shall have adjustable gate valves. Valves shall be
located inside of the riser at a point where they will remain dry and can be
operated in a safe and convenient manner. During the annual inspections the
valves shall be fully opened and closed at least once, and the certifying
official shall attest to this on the inspection form. To prevent vandalism, the
handwheel shall be chained to a ringbolt or manhole step.
      (5)   Principal Spillway. Each principal spillway shall be designed in
accordance with the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) standards and
specifications for the office serving the local county. Each principal spillway
shall have the capacity to pass the 100-year design storm flows. The inlet or
riser size for the pipe drops shall be designed so that the flow through the
structure goes from weir flow control to pipe flow control without going into
orifice control in the riser. The crest elevation of the primary spillway shall
be no less than one foot below the emergency spillway crest. Premium joint pipe
is required and a removable trash rack shall be installed at each location.
Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all pipe conduits through an
embankment.
      (6)   Emergency Spillway. An emergency spillway shall be provided on each
water quality and storm water management basin. Emergency spillways shall
convey flood flows safely past the embankment, and shall be designed in
accordance with NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the
local county. Emergency spillways shall have a 100-year design storm capacity
unless exempted in writing by the Community Engineer.
      (7)   Embankments. Each dam embankment shall be designed in accordance
with the NRCS standards and specifications for the office serving the county
that the project is located in. Anti-seep collars shall be provided for all
pipe conduits through an embankment.
      (8)   Safety Features.
         A.   The primary spillway opening shall not permit access to the
public and other non-maintenance personnel.
         B.   The perimeter of all water pool areas that are deeper than three
feet shall be surrounded by benches that meet the following:
            1.   A safety bench, with a maximum slope of three percent, which
extends outward, on dry land, from the shoreline. This bench will be a minimum
of twenty-five feet wide to provide for the safety of individuals and
maintenance vehicles that are adjacent to the water pool. The safety bench may
be landscaped, without the use of structures, to prevent access to the water
pool.
            2.   Side slopes between the safety bench and the aquatic bench
shall not be steeper than three to one (three feet horizontal for every one
foot vertical).
            3.   An aquatic bench that extends inward from the shoreline far
enough to ensure public safety and has a maximum depth of fifteen inches below
the normal water surface elevations. The aquatic bench may be landscaped to
prevent access to the deeper water pool. The aquatic bench may also be
incorporated into the post-construction water quality plan.
            4.   Side slopes beyond the aquatic bench and below the permanent
water level shall not be steeper than two to one (two feet horizontal for every
one foot vertical).
            5.   The contours of the pond will be designed and managed to
eliminate drop-offs and other hazards. Side slopes getting to the pond shall
not exceed three to one and shall terminate on a safety bench.
      (9)   Water Quality Basin. If a water quality basin is needed and cannot
be incorporated into an existing or planned detention or retention basin then a
separate water quality basin will need to be planned, designed, constructed and
maintained into perpetuity.
      (10)   Water Quality Basins will not be constructed in any permanent or
intermittent stream channel.
      (11)   Flexibility.
         A.   These standards are general guidelines and shall not limit the
right of the Community Engineer to impose at any time additional and/or more
stringent requirements nor shall the standards limit the right of the Community
Engineer to waive, in writing, individual requirements.
         B.   If the Community Engineer waives, in writing, individual
requirements, the new owner will provide the Community Engineer with the
information and documentation required to assure Ohio EPA that the waived
requirement will not degrade water quality.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.13   ALTERNATIVE ACTIONS.
   Where the Community Engineer determines that site constraints exist in a
manner that compromises the intent of this chapter to improve the management of
storm water runoff as established in this chapter, practical alternatives may
be used to result in an improvement of water quality and/or a reduction of
storm water runoff. Such alternatives must be in keeping with the intent and
likely cost of those measures that would otherwise be required to meet the
objectives of this section. When possible, all practical alternatives shall be
implemented within the drainage area of the proposed development project.

(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.16   CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE GUARANTEE.
   All permanent storm water, soil erosion, sediment control and water quality
practices not specifically waived by the Community shall be constructed prior
to the granting of the final plat approval. Upon the request of the owner, the
Community may defer the construction or installation of a permanent storm
water, soil erosion, sediment control or water quality practice prior to the
approval of the final plat where, in the Community Engineer's judgment, such
proper construction or installation is not immediately necessary for the
protection of the public health and safety; and where the prior installation or
construction of such improvement would constitute an undue hardship on the
owner because in the case of new vegetation or weather conditions, or because
in the case of concrete, building construction could cause cracking and
excessive wear and tear on new structures. In such event, the Community shall
require a security bond, escrow account, certified check or cash to guarantee
that such deferred improvements will be properly constructed or installed
within an agreed specified time, but not to exceed six months after the filing
of such final plat. The owner will provide a maintenance guarantee for all
permanent improvements, soil erosion, and sediment control and water quality
practices. The Community shall require a security bond, escrow account,
certified check or cash to guarantee that the planned temporary and permanent
soil erosion, sediment control and water quality practices will be constructed
and removed in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer.
   (a)    The Guarantee. The guarantee of both performance and maintenance will
be in the form of a security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash will be used by the
Community to complete any guaranteed construction or removal of improvements or
temporary and permanent soil erosion, sediment control and water quality
practices that are not adequately completed, maintained or removed by the owner
in a timely manner, as determined by the Community Engineer. The security bond,
escrow account, verified check or cash will be in the total amount of both the
performance guarantee and the maintenance guarantee. Ohio municipalities and
counties may require performance bonds or other guarantees for water management
improvement as stated in Ohio R.C. 711.101.
      (1)   Security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be
deposited with the Community prior to review by the Community Engineer and/or
its consultants to cover professional services of the Community Engineer,
Building Commissioner, Zoning Inspector and/or other experts required by the
Community Engineer, Community Council, Mayor or review boards.
      (2)   No soil disturbing activities shall be permitted until a security
bond, escrow account, verified check or cash has been posted to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer sufficient for the Community to perform
the obligations otherwise to be performed by the owner or person responsible
for the development area as stated in this chapter, and to allow all work to be
performed as needed in the event that the owner or person responsible for the
development area fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter. The
security bond, escrow account, verified check or cash shall be released only
after all work required by this regulation has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Community Engineer and all permit and inspection fees
required by these regulations have been paid in full.
      (3)   No project subject to this regulation shall commence without the
soil erosion and sediment control, and storm water management, and water
quality plans having been approved by the Community Engineer.
   (b)   Performance Guarantee. The furnishing of a performance guarantee will
be maintained in an amount of not less than 120 percent of the estimate
approved by the Community Engineer, of installation of the deferred
improvements.
   (c)   Maintenance Guarantee. The maintenance guarantee shall be maintained
for a period of not less than two years after final acceptance of the storm
water, soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality practices in an amount
equal to twenty percent of the estimate approved by the Community Engineer, of
the construction and, where necessary, removal of such practices.
   (d)   Time Extension. The Community Engineer may extend the time allowed for
the installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has
been provided with the receipt of a written request from the owner.
   (e)   Completion. Upon completion of the construction of improvements or
temporary and/or permanent soil erosion, sediment control, and water quality
practices and the removal of the temporary soil erosion, sediment control, and
water quality practices for which the performance guarantee has been provided
the owner shall notify the Community Engineer of this fact.
   (f)   Inspection. The Community will not release the security bond, escrow
account, verified check or cash guarantee until the Community Engineer has
inspected the site to ensure that the guaranteed items have been completed and/
or removed.
   (g)   Release. The construction maintenance guarantee shall not be released
by the  Community until all temporary soil erosion and sediment control
practices that are no longer needed have been removed, properly disposed of and
any trapped sediment has been stabilized.
(Ord. 1357-09.  Passed 8-18-09.)
1484.17   APPLICATION PROCEDURES FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION WATER QUALITY PLANS.
   (a)   This plan will be combined with the soil erosion and sediment control,
storm water management, riparian setback and wetland setback plans that have
also been developed for the site.
   (b)   (1)   Plans developed by the site owners and approved by the Community
in accordance with this regulation do not relieve the site owner of
responsibility for obtaining all other necessary permits and/or approvals from
federal, state, county, and local agencies and departments. If requirements
vary, the most stringent requirement shall be followed.
      (2)   If the Community will be requiring that the local soil and water
conservation district (SWCD) review the post-construction water quality plans
the Community should first discuss the issue and how to implement the SWCD plan
reviews with the local SWCD.

   ARTICLE XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the Village
Council of Poland, State of Ohio, does ordain this chapter as follows.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.02   FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The Village of Poland has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or
otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.03   STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.04   METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which
serve such use: be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.05   LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the Village of Poland as identified in Section
1486.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
Village of Poland.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.06   BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Mahoning County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective November 18,2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered professional engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Poland as required by Section
1486.27 Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Village Hall 308 South Main Street Poland,
Ohio 44514.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.07   ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.08   INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or federal law, such state or federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.09   WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the Village of Poland, any officer or
employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood
damage that results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative
decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.10   SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.11   DEFINITIONS.

      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).” Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.

levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded). Areas determined to be outside the
500-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood insurance study (FIS).” The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood protection elevation.” The flood protection elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation. In areas where no base flood elevations exist from
any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation can be historical
flood elevations, or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.” A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.”  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of  Poland's historic preservation program, which program is
certified by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of map change (LOMC).” A letter of map change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance
rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA). A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR). A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR). A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.” The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.” A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.” For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Ohio R.C. Chapter 3733.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.” As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.” Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date oft the Village of Poland
flood insurance rate map, November 18, 2009, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person.” Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.” A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis;
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection;
      (3)   Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.” A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.” A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.” A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special Flood Hazard Area.” Also known as “Areas of Special Flood
Hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate maps, flood
insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood hazard boundary
maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, A1-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.” The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection-of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.” A wailed and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial Damage.” Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.” Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of; which equals or
exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the “start of
construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have
incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by

base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than one foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a floodplain
development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer, demonstrating that
this standard has been met; or
      (2)   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
         A.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an increase
of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why these
alternatives are not feasible;
         B.   Section
1486.33(a)(2), items A. and C. - E.
   (c)   Alterations of a watercourse. For the purpose of these regulations, a

      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Village of Poland specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement
is required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1486.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of

1486.37   VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owning to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a Variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)    Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
   (b)   Notice for Public Hearing. The Appeals Board shall schedule and hold a
public hearing within thirty days after the receipt of an application for a
variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the hearing, a notice of
such hearing shall be given in one or more newspapers of general circulation in
the community at least ten days before the date of the hearing.
   (c)   Public Hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (d)   Conditions for Issuance of Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or  inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
         C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (2)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (e)   Other Conditions for Variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1486.37(c)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 1363-09.  Passed 10-06-09.)
1486.38   PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.

1488.01   PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   It is hereby determined that Yellow Creek, Burgess Run and Drake Run
in the Village of Poland contribute to the health, safety, and general welfare
of the residents of the Village of Poland. The specific purpose and intent of
this regulation is to regulate uses and developments within riparian setbacks
that would impair the ability of riparian areas to:
      (1)   Reduce flood impacts by absorbing peak flows, slowing the velocity
of flood waters, and regulating base flow.
      (2)   Assist stabilizing the banks of watercourses to reduce woody debris
from fallen or damaged trees, stream bank erosion, and the downstream transport
of sediments eroded from watercourse banks.
      (3)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses during periods of high flows by
filtering, settling, and transforming pollutants already present in
watercourses.
      (4)   Reduce pollutants in watercourses by filtering, settling, and
transforming pollutants in runoff before they enter watercourses.
      (5)   Provide watercourse habitats with shade and food.
      (6)   Reduce the presence of aquatic nuisance species to maintain a
diverse aquatic system.
      (7)   Provide habitat to a wide array of wildlife by maintaining diverse
and connected riparian vegetation.
      (8)   Benefit the Village of Poland by minimizing encroachment on
watercourse channels and the need for costly engineering solutions such as
gabion baskets and rip rap to protect structures and reduce property damage and
threats to the safety of watershed residents; and by contributing to the scenic
beauty and environment of the Village of Poland, and thereby preserving the
character of the Village of Poland, the quality of life of the residents of the
Village of Poland, and corresponding property values.
   (b)   The following regulation has been enacted to protect and enhance these
functions of riparian areas by providing reasonable controls governing
structures and uses within a riparian setback along the three designated
watercourses in the Village of Poland.

1488.10(a) of this chapter, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider the
following:
      (1)   The natural vegetation of the property as well as the percentage of
the parcel that is in the 100-year floodplain. The criteria of Poland Village
Code Section
242.01 (Flood Damage Prevention) may be used as guidance when granting
variances in the 100-year floodplain.
      (2)   The extent to which the requested variance impairs the flood
control, erosion control, water quality protection, or other functions of the
riparian setback. This determination shall be based on sufficient technical and
scientific data.
      (3)   The degree of hardship, with respect to the use of a property or
the degree of practical difficulty with respect to maintaining the riparian
setback as established in this chapter, placed on the landowner by this chapter
and the availability of alternatives to the proposed structure or use.
      (4)   Soil-disturbing activities permitted in the riparian setback
through variances should be implemented to minimize clearing to the extent
possible and to include Best Management Practices necessary to minimize erosion
and control sediment.
      (5)   The presence of significant impervious cover, or smooth vegetation
such as maintained lawns, in the riparian setback compromises its benefits to
the Village of Poland. Variances should not be granted for asphalt or concrete
paving in the riparian setback. Variances may be granted for gravel driveways
when necessary.
      (6)   Whether a property, otherwise buildable under the ordinances of the
Village of Poland, will be made unbuildable because of this chapter.
   (c)   In order to maintain the riparian setback to the maximum extent
practicable, the Board of Zoning Appeals may consider granting variations to
other area or setback requirements imposed on a property by the Zoning Code.
   (d)   In granting a variance under this chapter, the Board of Zoning
Appeals, for good cause, may impose such conditions that it deems appropriate
to maintain the purposes of this chapter.
(Ord. 1303-07.  Passed 3-20-07.)
1488.12   PROCEDURES FOR VARIANCES AND APPEALS.
   Any applicant seeking a variance to the conditions imposed under this
chapter or an appeal to an administrative decision made under this chapter
shall follow procedures as set forth in Poland Village Codified Ordinance
Section
1264.04.
(Ord. 1303-07.  Passed 3-20-07.)
1488.13   INSPECTION OF RIPARIAN SETBACKS.
   The identification of riparian setbacks shall be inspected by the Village of
Poland:
   (a)   Prior to soil disturbing activities authorized under this chapter. The
applicant shall provide the Village of Poland with at least fifteen working
days written notice prior to starting such soil disturbing activities.
   (b)   Any time evidence is brought to the attention of the Village of Poland
that uses or structures are occurring that may reasonably be expected to
violate the provisions of this chapter.
(Ord. 1303-07.  Passed 3-20-07.)
1488.99   PENALTY.
   (a)   Any person who shall violate any section of this chapter shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree and, upon conviction thereof,
shall be subject to punishment as provided in Ohio R.C. 519.99 and shall be
required to restore the riparian setback through a restoration plan approved by
the Board of Zoning Appeals.
   (b)   The imposition of any other penalties provided herein shall not
preclude the Village of Poland from instituting an appropriate action or
proceeding in a court of proper jurisdiction to prevent an unlawful
development, or to restrain, correct, or abate a violation, or to require
compliance with the provisions of this chapter or other applicable laws,
ordinances, rules, or regulations, or the orders of the Village of Poland
Zoning Inspector.
