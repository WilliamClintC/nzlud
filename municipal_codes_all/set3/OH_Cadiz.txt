EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

are not that many days in the concluding month, in which case the period ends
on the last day of that month.
         (ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be
computed by excluding the first and including the last day, except that when

three or more municipal officers or other persons shall be construed as giving
such authority to a majority of such officers or other persons, unless it shall
be otherwise expressly declared in the law giving the authority or inconsistent
with State statute or Charter provisions.
   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law
which shall contain any express provision excluding such construction, or when
the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.

liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;
      (4)   Affect any investigation, proceeding or remedy in respect of any
such privilege, obligation, liability, penalty, forfeiture or punishment; and
the investigation, proceeding or remedy may be instituted, continued or
enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.

a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.

101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.
   (a)   A reference to any portion of the Codified Ordinances applies to all
re-enactments or amendments thereof.
(ORC 1.55)
   (b)   If a section refers to a series of numbers or letters, the first and
the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is
superseded by the Codified Ordinances.

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
         (ORC 1.52)
101.07  DETERMINATION OF LEGISLATIVE INTENT.
   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:
      (1)   Compliance with the constitutions of the State and of the United
States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
         (ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
         (ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

133.04  COST FOR COPIES.
   The cost of copies made by the Village at the request of any person not an

belonging to or leased by the Village or any department thereof is used.
133.05  FUND BALANCE POLICY.
   The Village hereby adopts the following Fund Balance Policy:
   Fund Balance is divided into five classifications based primarily on the
extent to which the Village must observe constraints imposed upon the use of
its governmental-fund resources The classifications are as follows:
   (a)   Nonspendable:  The Village shall classify assets as nonspendable when
legally or contractually required to maintain the amounts intact.
   (b)   Restricted:  Fund balance is restricted when constraints placed on the
use of resources are either externally imposed by creditors (such as through
debt covenants), grantors, contributors, or laws or regulations of other
governments; or is imposed by law through constitutional provisions.
   (c)   Committed:  Council can commit amounts via formal action
(resolution).  The Village must adhere to these commitments unless the Council
amends the resolution.  Committed fund balance also incorporates contractual
obligations to the extent that existing resources in the fund have been
specifically committed to satisfy contractual requirements.
   (d)   Assigned: Assigned fund balances are intended for specific purposes
but do not meet the criteria to be classified as restricted or committed. 
Governmental funds other than the general fund report all fund balances as
assigned unless they are restricted or committed.  In the general fund,
assigned amounts represent intended uses established by Village Council or a
Village official delegated that authority by resolution, or by State Statute.
   (e)   Unassigned: Unassigned fund balance is the residual classification for
the general fund and includes amount not included in the other
classifications.  In other governmental funds, the unassigned classification is
used only to report a deficit balance.  (Ord. 2015-49.  Passed 12-17-15.)

(Ord. 2011-15.  Passed 10-20-11.)
145.04 CREDIT CARD POLICY.
   (a)   Purpose.  To provide user information to those employees who have been
approved by the Village of Cadiz (“Village”) to do business for Village using a
credit card or debit card issued in the Village’s name.  The use of credit
cards for Village financial transactions is limited and carefully controlled. 
While the use of credit cards is an accepted practice and, in some cases, the
only permitted practice, their use is allowed only for specific purposes and
situations to transact Village business.
   (b)   Village Credit Card Authorization.
      (1)   The Village Council shall approve the individuals within the
Village who shall have authority to sue the Village credit cards.  This list
shall be updated at least annually.  No employee shall be authorized to allow
another employee or individual to utilize a credit card without authorization. 
The current list of authorized users is as follows:
         A.   Clerk/Treasurer & Asst. Clerk.
         B.   Chief of Police.
         C.   Village Administrator.
         D.   Mayor.
         E.   Water & Sewer Clerk.
         F.   Income Tax Administrator.
         G.   All Department Superintendents.
      (2)   Council shall pass a resolution each year for the authorization for
Village credit cards with an estimated monthly dollar amount to be used.  This
monthly amount shall not be binding and actual purchasing shall be based upon
the needs of the Village.
         Currently, the limit on each credit card shall be up to $1,000.00 per
transaction, per day.  Emergency purchases exceeding this amount required joint
prior authorization from the Mayor and Fiscal Officer.
      (3)   The credit cards shall be permitted to be utilized both in person
as well as the purchase of goods over the internet, telephone or fax.  These
purchases must be evidenced by an order confirmation along with either the
original packing slip that accompanied the purchase goods or an itemized
receipt.  When using the internet, the user must make sure the website where
the credit card information is being placed is secure, and that all account
numbers are encrypted while being passed electronically.
      (4)   The Village Clerk shall keep a log of each time a credit is
unutilized by the above referenced authorized users.  If any of the authorized
users requires the credit card to be removed the Clerk’s Office, said user
shall sign out said card and upon return, shall sign said card back into the
Clerk’s office.  No credit card can be removed from the Clerk’s office for more
than a 48 hour period, except upon approval of both the Clerk and the Mayor. 
All credit card receipts shall be turned in to the Clerk’s Office when the
credit is signed back into the possession of the Clerk’s Office.  Any receipt
not turned in at that time could result in the user paying late fee or any
other charge, including interest, associated with the purchase.
      (5)   The Village Council hereby designates the Finance Committee
Chairman as the compliance officer for the ordinance.  He shall, on a monthly
basis, inspect all compliance issues and verify the land and shall sign a
verification of the same.
      (6)   All credit cards shall be in the name of the Village of Cadiz.
   (c)   Village Credit Card Use by Employees.  In order to assist the Village
with the payment of work-related and/or emergency expenses, it is in the best
interest to have certain credit cards available.  Employees who are authorized
to use Village credit cards will be held responsible for its proper use.  It is
impossible to anticipate every situation encountered by a Village employee or
official.  Therefore, these guidelines should be applied on a conservative
basis, consistent with normal business standards, with good judgment exercised
wherever the policy is sent.
   The following guidelines are established to assure the proper use of the
Village credit cards.
      (1)   A credit card held by the Village shall be used only to pay the
following work-related expenses:
         A.   Eligible uses of credit card: Food expenses, transportation
expenses, gasoline/oil expenses (Village vehicles) motor vehicle repair/
maintenance expenses (Village vehicles), telephone expenses, lodging expenses,
internet service provider expenses, office supplies and Village equipment of
the various departments.  (All per diem amounts and restrictions within the
travel policy are still applicable.)
         B.   Ineligible use of credit card:
            Personal purchases: Absolutely no personal use of the card is
allowed.  Personal purchases include: gratuities and excess daily meal
allowance; gasoline for any personal vehicle; cash advances; alcoholic
beverages.
      (2)   All existing purchasing policies apply to purchases made on a
credit card.
      (3)   No fees or interest charged by a card company because of late
payments due  will be paid from Village funds, unless authorized by the Village
Council.  Unauthorized payment of fees will be the responsibility of the
employee who utilized the card, who will be personally responsible for those
fees if they appear on the billing for their department.
      (4)   Fiscal Officer.  The Fiscal Officer is responsible to make sure
that any charges incurred by employees are authorized Village expenditures and
that adequate funds are available within the Village approved budget.
      (5)   The debit incurred as a result of the use of a credit card shall be
paid from monies appropriated to the specific appropriation line items of the
Village of Cadiz, Ohio.
      (6)   There shall not be a spending limit on the credit card unless
otherwise set by Council.
      (7)   For all credit card transactions, the employee or official using a
Village card shall submit to the Fiscal Officer documentation sufficient to
satisfy Internal Revenue Service requirements for employee business expenses. 
This documentation will include the credit card slip (customer copy) along with
a receipt or invoice from the vender that documents the foods or services
purchased, the cost of the goods or services and the date of the purchase. 
Each receipt will also indicate the official Village business for which the
expense was incurred.
      (8)   The individual authorized to make such purchases or returns will be
liable for payment of any undocumented items presented on an invoice for
payment.  Individual liability is imposed for inappropriate use pursuant to the
procedure established in ORC 301.27 and 301.29.  If within thirty (30) days
after issuance of a written notice to the amount shown on the written notice,
the Prosecuting Attorney shall recover that amount from the cardholder by civil
action in any court of appropriate jurisdiction.
      (9)   Violations will be cause for immediate revocation of authorization
to use a credit card or procurement card and may result in disciplinary action
up to and including termination.
      (10)   If the card is issued in the name of a specific officer or
employee, that officer/employee is liable in person and upon any official bond
the officer/employee has given to the Village to reimburse the Village for the
amount improperly charged.
      (11)   If the Village suspects the loss, theft, or possibility of
unauthorized use of the card, the officer/employee shall notify the Mayor and
Village Council immediately in writing.
      (12)   The auditor shall notify Council immediately if they determine
there has been an improper credit card expenditure.
      (13)   The Fiscal Officer is responsible for the physical custody of the
card, and for maintaining confidentiality of all information relating to the
card such as the account number and expiration date.  Said cards shall be kept
in the Village safe.  The card is not to be loaned to anyone or used by anyone
other than the person designated to do so.  The cardholder will sign a written
acknowledgment indicating that the cardholder understands the intent of the
program and agrees to adhere to the policy and guidelines established by the
Village.  The Village will retain the signed acknowledgment, and maintain
current record of all cardholders.
      (14)   All expenditures made using the Village credit card should be tax
exempt from Ohio sales tax.  Employees are responsible for informing vendors of
the sales tax exemption.  If requested by a vendor, a State of Ohio sales tax
exemption certificate is available from the Auditor’s office.
      (15)   The Fiscal Officer should retain a list of all employees
authorized to use the card.
      (16)   The situation may arise where there is a problem with a purchased
item or service.  Examples include broken merchandise, the billed amount does
not match the quote, the billed amount includes sales tax, the statement
contains a charge not recognized by the authorized individuals, or the
statement contains duplicate charges from a vendor.  In these instances, the
individual should try to solve the dispute with the supplier or merchant.  If
the purchased item needs to be returned for any reason, send the item back to
the supplier and request a credit to the account card.  The individual should
notify the Fiscal Officer so they can verify that the credit appears on a
subsequent statement.  The Village cannot accept cash or a rain check instead
of a vendor credit.  If the dispute cannot be resolved, the individual should
contact the Fiscal Officer.
      (17)   In the event that a credit card is lost or stolen, the individual
holding the card must notify the card issuer immediately.  Further use of the
card will be blocked.  Prompt action will reduce the liability for fraudulent
charges.  The individual must confirm the phone call by written notification to
the card issuer via mail or fax, with copies promptly given to the Fiscal
Officer.  The date and time of the phone report of the lost or stolen card
shall be included in the written notification.  The Village will initiate
issuance of a replacement card.
      (18)   Cardholders who terminate their employment or whose job duties
change and no longer include purchasing must surrender their credit card
immediately.  (Ord. 2018-59.  Passed 11-15-18.)

commence either or both of the following in the Harrison County Court of Common
Pleas:
      (1)   A civil action for injunctive relief to compel compliance with

request was contrived as pretext to create potential liability under this
section.

division (a) of this section or the number of civil actions commenced under
this section.  (ORC 149.351(D))

violated.  (ORC 149.351(E); Ord. 2014-12.  Passed 6-26-14.)
147.06  PUBLIC RECORDS POLICY.
   (a)    Purpose. The Village of Cadiz maintains many records that are used in
the administration and operation of the Village. In accordance with state law,
the Village of Cadiz Records Commission will adopt a schedule of records
retention and disposition that identifies these records and this schedule will
be available in the Clerk-Treasurer's Office and in each department. This
schedule lists generally the types of records that are stored on a fixed medium
(paper, computer, film and the like) that are created, received, or sent under
the jurisdiction of the Village and document the organization, function,
policies, decisions, procedures, operations, or other activities of the
Village. The records maintained by the Village and ability to access them are
means to provide trust between the public and the Village.
   (b)   Custodian of Public Records; When Available. The Clerk of Council is
the official Public Records Custodian of all records which are centrally
maintained by the Village. Department heads are the official custodians of all
records maintained within their departments. Public records requests may be
made directly to department heads, their employees, or through the Public
Records Custodian. Requests for records from the Police Department may be made
directly to the Police Chief.  Public records requests will be accommodated
during regular business hours when offices maintaining said records are open
for business. Public records requests will not be accepted on weekends or
holidays.
   (c)    General Provisions. 
      (1)    Public records.
         A.    Public records include the following: Any document-paper,
electronic (including, but not limited to e-mail), or other format-that is
created or received by, or comes under the jurisdiction of a public office that
documents the organization, functions, policies, decisions, procedures,
operations, or other activities of the office. All records of the Village of
Cadiz are public unless they are specifically exempt from disclosure under the
Ohio R.C. 149.43 or Federal law.
         B.    It is the policy of the Village of Cadiz that records will be
organized and maintained so that they are readily available for inspection and
copying.
      (2)    Record requests. Each request for public records should be
evaluated for a response using the following guidelines:
         A.    Although no specific language is required to make a request, the
requestor must at least identify the records requested with sufficient clarity
to allow the public office to identify, retrieve, and review the records. If it
is not clear what records are being sought, the employee or the Public Records
Custodian must contact the requestor for clarification, and should assist the
requestor in revising the request by informing the requestor of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
         B.   1.    The Public Records Custodian, department heads, or
employees may ask the requestor to put a verbal request in writing or may
inquire about the intended use of the information; but a written request is not
mandatory, identifying information is not required and the intended use does
not have to be disclosed. However, providing such information would benefit the
requestor by enhancing the ability of the Public Records Custodian to identify,
locate and deliver the public records requested. The Public Records Custodian
and departments are to make available Form PRR 100 that the requestor has the
option of using in making the request.
            2.    Public records can be accessed by one of the following
methods: a request to view public records in person; a request for copies of
public records that the requestor will personally pick up from the Public
Records Custodian; or a request for copies of public records that the requestor
wants to have mailed or otherwise transmitted to the requestor.
            3.    Public records must be made available for inspection
promptly. Copies of public records must be made available within a reasonable
period of time. "Prompt" and "reasonable" take into account the volume of
records requested; the proximity of the location where the records are stored;
and the necessity for any legal review of the records requested.
               a.    Request to view public records. The requestor may make a
request to view public records. The Public Records Custodian or department
shall prepare the public records for inspection "promptly" as required by the
Ohio Revised Code. The actual time required to comply with the request may
depend on the circumstances (such as the location of the records, the manner
kept or the volume of records requested).
               b.    Copies of public records. The requestor may make a request
to the Public Records Custodian or to the department to have copies of public
records made.
               c.    Transmitting copies of public records. A requestor may
request that copies of public records be transmitted to him or her by U.S. Mail
or by any other means of transmission that is available and is conducive to
transmitting the public records, and will be provided. While the Village is
under no obligation to provide records in electronic format, it is the policy
of the Village to provide information to the public in the most practical and
convenient manner, considering all of the circumstances. Therefore, if the
Village receives a request for information to be made available in an
electronic format, a determination as to whether such information will be
generated and released in electronic format will be made.
         C.    Each request should be evaluated for an estimated length of time
required to gather the records. Routine requests for records should be
satisfied immediately if feasible to do so. Routine requests include, but are
not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and final form), budgets, salary
information, forms and applications, personnel rosters, and the like. If fewer
than 10 pages of copies are requested or if the records are readily available
in an electronic format that can be e-mailed or downloaded easily, these should
be made as quickly as the equipment allows.
         D.    All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be
acknowledged in writing by the public office within three business days
following the office's receipt of the request.  If a request is deemed
significantly beyond "routine", such as seeking a voluminous number of copies
or requiring extensive research, the acknowledgment must include the following:
            1.    An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy
the request.
            2.    An estimated cost if copies are requested.
            3.    Any items within the request that may be exempt from
disclosure.
      (3)    Fees and payment.
         A.    Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual
cost of making copies or printing pictures and shall also pay the actual cost
(e.g. postage) of delivery and other supplies used in mailing, delivery or
transmission of the public record. Payment for public records requests is
required prior to the actual copying or printing of records.
         B.    If the Public Records Custodian or department uses an outside
copying service to make the copies, the requestor will be required to pay the
cost of the entire copying job, as billed by the copying service. Copies that
are requested in some format other than normal letter or legal paper will be
"at cost", without taking into account employee time spent preparing the
copies. (For example, public records in electronic format placed on a CD will
be assessed the cost of the CD, plus the cost, if any, of creating the
electronic copies.)
         C.    Public records will only be copied by the Public Records
Custodian or other authorized officers, employees or representatives. The
Public Records Custodian or department may use an outside copying service to
make the copies, at their discretion. Under no circumstances will the requestor
be permitted to make the copies himself or herself. The manner of copying is at
the discretion of the Public Records Custodian or the department. Requests to
copy a certain number of the public records on a given page, by "reducing" copy
size or otherwise, may be met at the discretion of the Public Records Custodian
or department.
         D.    Individual departments may adopt a policy that if fewer than 5
pages of copies are requested, no fee will be charged. All requests exceeding
five pages will be charged a fee of seven cents ($0.07) per page for all pages
copied. No receipt will be required to be issued for payments received of less
than one dollar ($1.00).
         E.    Ohio law may provide for specific fees to be charged for certain
records (e.g. police accident reports: four dollars ($4.00) each, with
photographs at an additional cost, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5502.12).
      (4)    Denial of public records request.
         A.    Under certain circumstances, some records are not defined as
"public records" under Ohio law or are exempt from disclosure under federal
law. In these situations, the public record request will be denied on that
basis. The Ohio Revised Code requires that any denial be supported by legal
authority. A denial that is responding to a written public records request will
also be given in writing, using Form PRR 101. Written reasons for denial will
not be required for verbal public records requests. Any denial of public
records requested must include an explanation, including legal authority. If
portions of a record are public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions
are to be redacted and the rest released. If there are redactions, each
redaction must be accompanied by a supporting explanation, including legal
authority, unless federal or state law authorized or required the redaction.
         B.    The Ohio Revised Code regards certain actions as being "denials"
of public record requests. These situations are handled as follows:
            1.    Redaction.
               a.    The Ohio Revised Code defines a "redaction" as "obscuring
or deleting any information that is exempt from the duty to permit public
inspection or copying from an item that otherwise meets the definition of a
"record" in Ohio R.C. 149.011". Examples of redaction are ''blacking out" or
"whiting out" or "cutting out" portions of a document.
               b.    When a public record contains information that is not
within the definition of a "public record" as defined by law, or is exempt by
law, the Public Records Custodian or department will make available that
portion of the public record that does meet the definition of a "public
record".  The Public Records Custodian or department shall make a copy of the
public record, perform the redaction, then make a copy of that sheet and make
the second copy available to the requestor. The requestor will not be charged
for the first copy made. If practical, the first copy will be retained by the
Public Records Custodian or department.
            2.    Requests that are ambiguous, overly broad, or are difficult
to identify the public records requested.
         At times, a requestor may make a public records request from which the
Public Records Custodian or department cannot determine which public records
are being sought. In such circumstances, the Public Records Custodian or
department will inform the requestor that the public records request is denied,
but will give the requestor an opportunity
         to more accurately describe the public records sought. If the
requestor is seeking public records organized in a certain way, but the public
records are not organized in that way, the Public Records Custodian or
department will inform the requestor of the manner that the public records of
the office under discussion are maintained and accessed.
         The requestor may then submit a public records request that more
accurately reflects the actual organization of the public records sought.
   (d)    Compliance. The Public Records Custodian or department reserves the
right to consult with legal counsel prior to the release of any public records.
This is to allow the Village to comply with laws regarding the release of
certain records.
   (e)   Failure to Respond to a Public Records Request.  The Village of Cadiz
recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to properly respond
to a public records request. A public office's failure to comply with a request
may result in remedies and damages according to Ohio R.C. 149.43.

181.03  IMPOSITION OF TAX.
   (a)   Subject to the provisions of Section
181.06, an annual tax for the purposes specified in Section
181.03 shall be imposed on and after January 1, 1977, at a rate of one percent
(1%) per year upon the following:
      (1)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or received on and after January 1, 1977, by residents of the
Village of Cadiz.  For clarification "income" includes, but is not limited to:
         A.   Effective January 1, 2010 lottery, gambling and sports winnings,
games of chance, and prizes and/or awards.  No deductions against this income
are permitted.
         B.    Effective January 1, 2010 if the taxpayer is considered a
professional gambler for federal income tax purposes, related deductions as
permitted by the Internal Revenue Code shall be allowed against gambling and
sports winnings.
      (2)   On all income, qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation
earned and/or  received on and after January 1, 1977, by nonresidents for work
done or services performed or rendered in the Village of Cadiz.  Separation
pay, termination pay, reduction-in-force pay, and other compensation paid as a
result of an employee leaving the service of an employer shall be allocable
only to the Village of Cadiz.
         A.    The Village of Cadiz shall not, however, tax the compensation of
a non-resident individual who will be deemed to be an occasional entrant if all
of the following apply:
            1.   The compensation is paid for personal services performed by
the individual in the Village of Cadiz on twelve or fewer days during the
calendar year, in which case the individual shall be considered an occasional
entrant for purposes of the Village of Cadiz income tax.
              2.   In the case of an individual who is an employee, the
principal place of business of the individual's employer is located outside the
Village of Cadiz and the individual pays tax on compensation described in
Section
181.03 (a)(2) to the Municipality, if any, in which the employer's principal
place of business is located, and no portion of that tax is refunded to the
individual.
            3.     The individual is not a professional entertainer or
professional athlete, the promoter of a professional entertainment or sports
event, or an employee of such a promoter, all as may be reasonably defined by

         B.    Beginning with the thirteenth day, if an individual deemed to
have been an occasional entrant to the Village of Cadiz performs services
within the Village, the employer of said individual shall begin withholding the
Village of Cadiz income tax from remuneration paid by the employer to the
individual, and shall remit the withheld income tax to the Village of Cadiz in
accordance with the requirements of this Ordinance.  Since the individual can
no longer be considered to have been an occasional entrant, the employer is
further required to remit taxes on income earned in the Village of Cadiz by the
individual for the first twelve days.
         C.    If the individual is self-employed, it shall be the
responsibility of the individual to remit the appropriate income tax to the
Village of Cadiz.

unincorporated business entity.
      (4)   A.    On the portion attributable to the Village of Cadiz of the
net profits earned on and after January 1, 1977 by all nonresident
unincorporated businesses, professions, associations or other activities,
derived from work done or services performed or rendered and business or other
activities conducted in the Village of Cadiz, whether or not such
unincorporated business entity has an office or place of business in the
Village of Cadiz.
         B.   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits
earned and/or received on and after January 1, 1977 by a resident partner and/
or owner of a nonresident unincorporated business entity, including
associations, not attributable to the Village of Cadiz and not levied against
such unincorporated business entity.

profits earned on and after January 1, 1977, of all corporations derived from
work done or services performed or rendered and business or other activities
conducted in the Village of Cadiz, whether or not such corporations have an
office or place of business in the Village of Cadiz.
      (6)   Effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable only to the extent
of the portion, if any, that represents wages, or net earnings from self-
employment.
   (b)   Rentals from Real Property.
      (1)   Rentals received by the taxpayer are to be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities only if, and to the extent
that, the rental, ownership, management or operation of the real estate from
which such rentals are derived (whether so rented, managed or operated by the
taxpayer individually or through agents or other representatives) constitutes a
business activity of the taxpayer in whole or in part.
      (2)   Where the rental of any real properties, regardless of number and
value, in this Village, it shall be prima facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer and the net income of such rental properties shall be subject to
tax; provided that in the case of commercial property, the owners shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed
or fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, provided further that in the case of farm property, the owner shall be
considered engaged in a business activity when he shares in the crops or when
the rental is based on a percentage of the gross or net receipts derived from
the farm; and provided further that the person who operates a licensed rooming
house shall be considered in business.
      (3)   Rental income received by a taxpayer engaged in the business of
buying or selling real estate shall always be considered as part of business
income.
      (4)   Owners of rental property who are non-residents of this Village,
whether individuals or business entities, are subject to tax only on the income
from real property located in this Village.  Only the income from such
properties located within this Village shall be considered.  Net losses may be
offset against net profits only between rental properties located in this
Village.
      (5)   Owners of rental property who are residents of this Village are
subject to tax regardless of the location of the real property owned, excepting
that if, any such property is located and subject to a municipal income tax by
another taxing municipality, credit shall be claimed in accordance with Section
181.14 .
      (6)   Corporations owning or managing real estate are taxable only on the
portion of income derived from property located in this Village.
      (7)   Reporting of tenant occupancies shall be prepared in accordance
with the provisions in Section
181.15 .
   (c)    Determination of Allocation of Tax (Method of Determination).
      (1)   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and
without the boundaries of the Village of Cadiz shall be considered as having a
taxable situs in the Village of Cadiz for purposes of municipal income taxation
in the same proportion as the average ratio of:
         A.   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal
property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the
Village of Cadiz during the taxable period to the average original cost of all
of the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.  As used in
this section, real property shall include property rented or leased by the
taxpayer and the value of such property shall be determined by multiplying the
annual rental thereon by eight.
         B.     Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to person employed in the business or profession for services performed
in the Village of Cadiz to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever
their services are performed.  For tax year 2004 and subsequent tax years,
wages, salaries, and other compensation shall be included to the extent they
represent qualifying wages.
         C.   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Village to gross receipts
of the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula in Section
181.03 (b)(1) does not produce an equitable result, another basis (including
the books and records method) may, under uniform regulations of the Village of
Cadiz, be substituted so as to produce such result.
      (3)   As used in subsection (b)(1) hereof, "sales made in the Village of
Cadiz" means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Cadiz regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered
from a stock of goods within the Village;
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the Village of Cadiz regardless of where title passes even though transported
from a point outside the Village of Cadiz if the taxpayer is regularly engaged
through its own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the
Village of Cadiz and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion;
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the Village of Cadiz to purchasers outside the Village of Cadiz
regardless of where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through its own
employees, regularly engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the
place where delivery is made.
   (d)   The following provisions apply with respect to the carry forward of
net operating losses:
      (1)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer in any
taxable year, attributable to the Village of Cadiz, may be applied against the
portion of the net profits of the taxpayer attributable to the Village of Cadiz
in succeeding taxable years until exhausted, but in no event for more than five
(5) taxable years immediately following the taxable year in which the loss
occurred.  No portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer shall be
carried back against net profits of any prior taxable year.
      (2)   The portion of a net operating loss sustained by a taxpayer for any
taxable year attributable to the Village of Cadiz shall be determined in the
same manner as provided herein for determining net profits attributable to the
Village of Cadiz.
   (e)   Exemptions.  The tax provided for herein shall not be levied upon the
following:
      (1)   Military pay or allowances of members of the armed forces of the

plans, retirement benefits, annuities and similar payments made to an employee
or to the beneficiary of an employee under a retirement program or plan
(whether qualified or nonqualified), disability payments received from private
industry, or local, state, or federal governments, or from charitable,
religious or educational organizations to the extent they are not taxable to
Medicare, and the proceeds of sick, accident, or liability insurance policies.
      (3)   Receipts by bona fide charitable, religious and educational
organizations and associations, when those receipts are from casual
entertainment, amusements, sports events and health and welfare activities
conducted by bona fide charitable, religious and educational organizations and
associations.
      (4)   The income of religious, fraternal, charitable, scientific,
literary and educational institutions to the extent that such income is derived
from tax exempt real estate, tax exempt tangible or intangible property or tax
exempt activities, but only to the extent that the said income is exempt from
federal income tax.

religious, educational or literary organizations or labor unions, lodges and
similar organizations.

and any other Federal Schedules, if applicable.  For businesses, the entire
federal return and supporting schedules shall be submitted.
   (c)   The Income Tax Administrator may extend the time for filing the annual
return upon the request of the taxpayer.    The extended due date for
individual, and for businesses not filing the extension request through the
Ohio Business Gateway, shall be the last day of the month following the month
to which the federal income tax due date has been extended.  For businesses
filing the extension request through the Ohio Business Gateway, the extended

filing the final return.  Within three months from the final determination of
any federal tax liability affecting the taxpayer's Village of Cadiz tax
liability, such taxpayer shall make and file an amended Village of Cadiz return
showing income subject to the Village of Cadiz tax based upon such final

Cadiz constituting a portion only of its total business, the Income Tax
Administrator shall require such additional information as may be necessary to
ascertain whether net profits allocable to the Village of Cadiz are being
distorted by the shifting of income, apportionment of expenses or other devices
available to a common control.  If the Income Tax Administrator finds that a
person's net profits allocable to the Village of Cadiz are distorted by reason
of transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he
shall adjust such transactions so as to produce a fair and proper allocation of
net profits to the Village of Cadiz.  If necessary, the Income Tax
Administrator may require the filing of a consolidated return.
   (f)   A taxpayer who has overpaid the amount of tax to which the Village of

is made.  No taxes, credits, or refunds of less than one dollar ($1.00) shall
be collected, credited, or refunded.
   (g)   Taxes erroneously paid shall not be refunded unless a claim for refund
is made in writing within three (3) years from the date on which such payment
was made or the return was due.
   (h)   (1)     Where necessary, an amended return shall be filed in order to
report additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of
tax overpaid, subject to the requirements or limitations, or both , contained

181.01  through
181.05 .  Such amended return shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Income Tax Administrator.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting

based upon such final determination of federal tax liability, and pay any
additional tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.

municipality that does not levy an income tax on net profits may be used to
offset net profits in the Village of Cadiz.  Business net profits in any
municipality that does not levy an income tax on net profits may be offset by
losses in the Village of Cadiz.
   (j)    Any business, profession, association or corporation reporting a net
loss is subject to the filing requirements of this chapter.

or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein.  The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of such business to file the return or
pay taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   (m)   (1)   Retirees having no income considered taxable for Village of
Cadiz income tax purposes may file, with the Income Tax Administrator, a

   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the Village of Cadiz who
employs one or more persons on an income, qualifying wage, commission or other
compensation basis shall deduct at the time of the payment of such income,
qualifying wage, commission or other compensation, the tax provided for in
Section
181.03 and shall make a return and pay to the Village of Cadiz Income Tax
Office, the amount of taxes so deducted, on a form or forms prescribed by or
acceptable to the Income Tax Administrator as follows:
   (b)    The failure of an employer to withhold taxes required by this section
as required by law does not relieve an employee from the liability for the tax.
   (c)   Each employer required to deduct and withhold taxes is liable for the
payment of that amount required to be deducted and withheld, whether or not
such taxes have in fact been withheld and such amount shall be deemed to be a

Miscellaneous Income Forms and/or a list of names, addresses, Social Security

charged with the responsibility for withholding the tax, and/or of filing the
report and making payment, is personally liable for failure to file the report

corporation or limited partnership does not discharge an officer's or
employee's liability for a prior failure of the corporation or limited
partnership to file returns or pay the tax due.
   (g)    All employers that provide any contractual service within the Village
of Cadiz, and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service shall,

tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting

located indicating the total amount deducted and withheld during the preceding
calendar year.  The video lottery sales agent shall remit electronically with
the annual return any amount that was deducted and withheld and that was not
previously remitted.  If the name, address, or social security number of a
person or the amount deducted and withheld with respect to that person was

hundred per cent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for

year reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with

was not domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that

      (2)   (a)   Except as provided in division (A)(2)(b) of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan of the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized for
federal  income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         (b)   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (A)(2)(a) of this
section computed without regard to division (A)(2)(b) of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
   denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of
which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.   
         (c)   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the

year for which the  taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.  If

tax rate" is a weighted average of those different tax rates.  The weighted
average shall be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (B)   (1)   Except as provided in division (D) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year.  The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.   
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid to more than one municipal corporation with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (C)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (D)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan;
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to received the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

182.096.
   (B)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality.  To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
182.096, the Municipality will allow  a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the

182.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (A)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
section 5703.056 of the Ohio Revised code.
      (2)   The Tax Administrative may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service.  The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Section 718.18 of the Revised Code is prima
facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (B)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division.  A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail.  For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment by certified mail.  For the
purposes of this section, a person is associated with an address at the time
the Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the
person was residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting     business at
the address; or if, before that tie, the person had conducted business at the
address and, when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent of the person's
affiliate was conducting business at the address.  For the purposes of this
section, a person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the
assessment was mailed, owned or controlled at least    twenty per cent, as
determined by voting rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (B)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person.  Nothing is this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax    Review.
         (Ord. 2015-34.  Passed 11-19-15.)
182.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF  TAX REVIEW.

official of the Municipality.  This member may be an employee of the
Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or equivalent officer, or
the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly
involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years.  There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority.  The board member appointed by the
top administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion
of the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth  in Section
718.11(A)(4) of the Revised Code.
      (5)   A member of the Board who, for any reason, ceases to meet the
qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by the operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created. 
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term.  No vacancy on the Board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the Board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board in the member's
place.  This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the Board.
   (B)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (C)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board by filing a request with the Board.  The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (D)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (C)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing.  If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the Board and/or may  be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative.  The Board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties.  In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within one hundred twenty days after the first
day of the hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (E)    The Board may affirm reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any payr of that assessment.  The Board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the Board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination.  The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the Board's
final determination as provided in section 5717.011 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (F)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions.  The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review.  Such records are not public records
available for inspection under section 149.43 of the Ohio Revised Code.  For
this reason,  any documentation, copies of returns or reports, final
determinations, or working papers for each case must be maintained in a secure
location under the control of the Tax Administrator.  No member of the Local
Board of Tax Review may remove such documentation, copies of returns or
reports, final determinations, or working papers from the hearing.  Hearings
requested by a taxpayer before a Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to
this section are not meetings of a public body subject to section 121.22 of the
Ohio Revised Code.  For this reason, such hearings shall not be open to the
public, and only those parties to the case may be present during the hearing. 
(Ord. 2015-34.  Passed 11-19-15.)
182.19  ACTIONS TO RECOVER; STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS.

pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the motor
vehicle established by the Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under
Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor vehicle.  However,
if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the municipal corporation
has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service shall give
the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or operator

to a telephone call, identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor
vehicle and requests information pertaining to its location.
      (2)   Any person who registers a complaint that is the basis of the
Police Chief’s order for the removal and storage of a motor vehicle under
subsection (a)(1) of this section shall provide the identity of the law
enforcement agency with which the complaint was registered to any person who
identifies self as the owner or operator of the motor vehicle and requests
information pertaining to its location.

municipal corporation.
         B.   Presentation of proof of ownership, which may be evidenced by a

the motor vehicle, or a lease agreement.
When the owner of a vehicle towed under this section retrieves the vehicle, the
towing service or storage facility in possession of the vehicle shall give the
owner written notice that if the owner disputes that the motor vehicle was
lawfully towed, the owner may be able to file a civil action under Ohio R.C.
4513.611.
      (2)   Upon presentation of proof of ownership as required under
subsection (d)(1)B. of this section, the owner of a motor vehicle that is
ordered into storage under subsection (a)(1) of this section may retrieve any
personal items from the motor vehicle without retrieving the vehicle and
without paying any fee.  However, a towing service or storage facility may
charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the Public Utilities
Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the owner retrieves the
personal items after hours, unless the towing service or storage facility fails
to provide the notice required under division (B)(3) of Ohio R.C. 4513.69, if
applicable.  The owner of a motor vehicle shall not do either of the following:
         A.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
sheriff or chief of police, as applicable, to be necessary to a criminal
investigation;
         B.   Retrieve any personal item from a vehicle if it would endanger
the safety of the owner unless the owner agrees to sign a waiver of liability.
For purposes of subsection (d)(2) of this section, “personal items” do not
include any items that are attached to the motor vehicle.
      (3)   If a motor vehicle that is ordered into storage pursuant to
subsection (a)(1) of this section remains unclaimed by the owner for thirty
days, the procedures established by Ohio R.C. 4513.61 and 4513.62 apply.
   (e)   (1)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of, any motor

to 4513.65.

         E.   A statement that the failure to recover a towed vehicle may
result in the loss of title to the vehicle as provided in division (B) of Ohio
R.C. 4505.101.
In order to comply with the requirements of subsection (a)(1) of this section,
the owner of a private property may modify an existing sign by affixing to the
existing sign stickers or an addendum in lieu of replacing the sign.

as a private tow- away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section,
without the consent of the owner of the private property or in violation of any
posted parking condition or regulation, the owner of the private property may
cause the removal of the vehicle by a towing service.  The towing service shall
remove the vehicle in accordance with this section.  The vehicle owner and the
operator of the vehicle are considered to have consented to the removal and
storage of the vehicle, to the payment of the applicable fees established by
the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, and to
the right of a towing service to obtain title to the vehicle if it remains

unlicensed tow truck operator.
      (3)   No towing service shall remove a vehicle from a private tow-away
zone except pursuant to a written contract for the removal of vehicles entered

is located.
   (c)   If the owner or operator of a vehicle that is being removed under
authority of subsection (b) of this section, arrives after the vehicle has been
prepared for removal, but prior to the actual removal from the property, the
towing service shall give the vehicle owner or operator oral or written
notification at the time of such arrival that the vehicle owner or operator may
pay a fee of not more than one-half of the fee for the removal of the vehicle
established by the Public Service Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C.
4921.25, in order to obtain release of the vehicle.  That fee may be paid by

processor and mobile service is not available at the time of the transaction. 
Upon payment of that fee, the towing service shall give the vehicle owner or
operator a receipt showing both the full amount normally assessed and the
actual amount received and shall release the vehicle to the owner or operator. 
Upon its release the owner or operator immediately shall move the vehicle so
that the vehicle is not parked on the private property established as a private
tow-away zone without the consent of the owner of the private property or in
violation of any posted parking condition or regulation.
   (d)   (1)   Prior to towing a vehicle under subsection (b) of this section,
a towing service shall make all reasonable efforts to take as many photographs
as necessary to evidence that the vehicle is clearly parked on private property
in violation of a private tow-away zone established under subsection (a) of
this section.

lienholder or at least two years after the date on which the vehicle was towed,
whichever is earlier.
      (2)   A towing service shall deliver a vehicle towed under subsection (b)
of this section to the location from which it may be recovered not more than
two hours after the time it was removed from the private tow-away zone, unless
the towing service is unable to deliver the motor vehicle within two hours due
to an uncontrollable force, natural disaster, or other event that is not within
the power of the towing service.
   (e)   (1)   If an owner of a private property that is established as a
private tow-away zone in accordance with subsection (a) of this section causes
the removal of a vehicle from that property by a towing service under
subsection (b) of this section, the towing service, within two hours of
removing the vehicle, shall provide notice to the Police Department concerning
all of the following:
         A.   The vehicle’s license number, make, model and color;
         B.   The location from which the vehicle was removed;
         C.   The date and time the vehicle was removed;
         D.   The telephone number of the person from whom the vehicle may be

         E.   The address of the place from which the vehicle may be recovered.
      (2)   The Chief of Police shall maintain a record of any vehicle removed
from private property in the Chief’s jurisdiction that is established as a
private tow-away zone of which the Chief has received notice under this
section.  The record shall include all information submitted by the towing
service.  The Chief shall provide any information in the record that pertains
to a particular vehicle to a person who, either in person or pursuant to a
telephone call, identifies self as the owner, operator or lienholder of the
vehicle, and requests information pertaining to the vehicle.
   (f)   (1)   When a vehicle is removed from private property in accordance
with this section, within three days of the removal, the towing service or
storage facility from which the vehicle may be recovered shall cause a search
to be made of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles to ascertain the
identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle.  The Registrar
of Motor Vehicles shall insure that such information is provided in a timely
manner.  Subject to subsection (f)(4) of this section, the towing service or
storage facility shall send notice to the vehicle owner and any known
lienholder as follows:
         A.   Within five business days after the Registrar of Motor Vehicles
provides the identity of the owner and any lienholder of the motor vehicle, if

this section is received, as evidenced by a receipt signed by any person, or
the towing service or storage facility has been notified that delivery was not
possible, the towing service or storage facility, if authorized under
subsection (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101, may initiate the process for obtaining a
certificate of title to the motor vehicle as provided in that section.
      (3)   A towing service or storage facility that does not receive a signed
receipt of notice, or a notification that delivery was not possible, shall not
obtain, and shall not attempt to obtain, a certificate of title to the motor
vehicle under division (B) of Ohio R.C. 4505.101.

section, “personal items” do not include any items that are attached to the
vehicle.
   (h)   No person shall remove, or cause the removal of any vehicle from

303.083 as amended are now codified in Section
303.081.)
303.09  LEAVING JUNK AND OTHER VEHICLES ON PRIVATE OR PUBLIC PROPERTY WITHOUT
PERMISSION OR NOTIFICATION.
   (a)   No person shall willfully leave any vehicle or an "abandoned junk
motor vehicle" as defined in Ohio R.C. 4513.63 on private property for more
than seventy-two consecutive hours without the permission of the person having
the right to the possession of the property or on a public street or other
property open to the public for purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or
upon or within the right of way of any road or highway, for forty-eight
consecutive hours or longer, without notification to the Police Chief of the
reasons for leaving the vehicle in such place.
   For purposes of this section, the fact that a vehicle has been so left
without permission or notification is prima-facie evidence of abandonment.
Nothing contained in this section shall invalidate the provisions of other
ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor vehicles on
streets, highways, public property or private property within the
Municipality. 
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and
shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the Municipality in disposing of
an abandoned junk motor vehicle that is the basis of the violation, less any
money accruing to the Municipality from this disposal of the vehicle.  (ORC
4513.64)
303.10  LEAVING JUNK VEHICLES ON PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH PERMISSION OF OWNER.
   (a)   For the purposes of this section, "junk motor vehicle" means any motor
vehicle meeting the requirements of Ohio R.C. 4513.63(B) to (E) that is left
uncovered in the open on private property for more than seventy-two hours with
the permission of the person having the right to the possession of the
property, except if the person is operating a junk yard or scrap metal
processing facility licensed under authority of Ohio R.C. 4737.05 to 4737.12;
or regulated under authority of the Municipality; or if the property on which
the motor vehicle is left is not subject to licensure or regulation by any
governmental authority, unless the person having the right to the possession of
the property can establish that the motor vehicle is part of a bona fide
commercial operation, or if the motor vehicle is a collector's vehicle.
   Persons may store or keep by unrestricted method any collector's vehicle as
defined in Ohio R.C. 4501.01(F) on private property with the permission of the
person having the right to the possession of the property; except that such
person having such permission shall conceal, by means of buildings, fences,
vegetation, terrain or other suitable obstruction, any unlicensed collector's
vehicle stored in the open.
   Council, the Chief of Police or the Municipal Zoning Authority, may send
notice by certified mail with return receipt requested, to the person having
the right to the possession of the property on which a junk motor vehicle is
left, that within ten days of receipt of the notice, the junk motor vehicle
either shall be covered by being housed in a garage or other suitable structure
or shall be removed from the property.
   No person shall willfully leave a junk motor vehicle uncovered in the open
for more than ten days after receipt of a notice as provided in this section. 
The fact that a junk motor vehicle is so left is prima-facie evidence of
willful failure to comply with the notice.  Each subsequent period of thirty
days that a junk motor vehicle continues to be so left constitutes a separate
offense.
   (b)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.

            4.   Any device that is physically or electronically integrated
into the motor vehicle.
         B.   Engaging in any activity that is not necessary to the operation
of a vehicle and impairs, or reasonably would be expected to impair, the
ability of the operator to drive the vehicle safely.
      (2)   “Distracted” does not include operating a motor vehicle while
wearing an earphone or earplug over or in both ears at the same time.  A person
who so wears earphones or earplugs may be charged with a violation of Section

      (3)   “Distracted” does not include conducting any activity while
operating a utility service vehicle or a vehicle for or on behalf of a utility,
provided that the driver of the vehicle is acting in response to an emergency,
power outage or a circumstance affecting the health or safety of individuals.
As used in subsection (a)(3) of this section:
         A.   “Utility” means an entity specified in division (A), (C), (D),
(E) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 4905.03.
         B.   “Utility service vehicle” means a vehicle owned or operated by a

violation, the offender is subject to the applicable penalty for the violation
and, notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 2929.28, is subject to an additional fine of not
more than one hundred dollars ($100.00) as follows:
      (1)   Subject to Traffic Rule 13, if a law enforcement officer issues an
offender a ticket, citation or summons for a violation of any section of the
Traffic Code that indicates that the offender was distracted while committing
the violation and that the distracting activity was a contributing factor to
the commission of the violation, the offender may enter a written plea of
guilty and waive the offender’s right to contest the ticket, citation or
summons in a trial provided that the offender pays the total amount of the fine
established for the violation and pays the additional fine of one hundred
dollars ($100.00).
         In lieu of payment of the additional fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00), the offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety
course, the duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio
Director of Public Safety.  If the offender attends and successfully completes
the course, the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender
successfully completed the course.  The offender shall be required to pay the
total amount of the fine established for the violation, but shall not be
required to pay the additional fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long

such written evidence.
      (2)   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket, citation
or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is convicted of the
violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties provided by law, may
impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may impose the additional
fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00).
If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty for the violation
and an additional fine of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the
court shall inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine
of not more than one hundred dollars ($100.00), the offender instead may elect
to attend the distracted driving safety course described in subsection (b)(1)
of this section.  If the offender elects the course option and attends and
successfully completes the course, the offender shall be issued written
evidence that the offender successfully completed the course.  The offender
shall be required to pay the total amount of the fine established for the
violation, but shall not be required to pay the additional fine of not more
than one hundred dollars ($100.00), so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

313.01  OBEDIENCE TO TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES.
   (a)   No pedestrian or driver of a vehicle shall disobey the instructions of
any traffic control device placed in accordance with the provisions of this
Traffic Code, unless at the time otherwise directed by a police officer. 
   No provisions of this Traffic Code for which signs are required shall be
enforced against an alleged violator if at the time and place of the alleged
violation an official sign is not in proper position and sufficiently legible
to be seen by an ordinarily observant person.  Whenever a particular section of
this Traffic Code does not state that signs are required, that section shall be
effective even though no signs are erected or in place. 
   (b)   Except as otherwise provided in this subsection, whoever violates this
section is guilty of a minor misdemeanor.  If, within one year of the offense,
the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one
predicate motor vehicle or traffic offense, whoever violates this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.  If, within one year of the
offense, the offender previously has been convicted of two or more predicate
motor vehicle or traffic offenses, whoever violates this section is guilty of a
misdemeanor of the third degree.
   If the offender commits the offense while distracted and the distracting
activity is a contributing factor to the commission of the offense, the
offender is subject to the additional fine established under Section
303.991 of the Traffic Code.  (ORC 4511.12)
313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.  (ORC
4511.65)
313.03  TRAFFIC SIGNAL INDICATIONS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles, and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication is
permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left, or make a u-turn
movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device.  Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, is permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time.  Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or
left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk.
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Section
313.05 , pedestrians facing a circular green signal indication are permitted to
proceed across the roadway within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. 
The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the
intersection or so close as to create an immediate hazard at the time  that the
green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
is thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing arrow
movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will be
exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection.  The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated.  The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, shall not start to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, before then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3)
of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street.  The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street.  The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow, and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making
a stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Section
313.05  or other traffic control device, pedestrians facing a steady circular
red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on State highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication:
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices.  Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time.  Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right- of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication:
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection.  The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk.  Pedestrians shall yield
the right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that
the flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable. 
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   General Application: In the event an official traffic-control signal
is erected and maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions
of this section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by
their nature can have no application.  Any stop required shall be made at a
sign or marking on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in
the absence of any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   Exception.  This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. 
Conduct of drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be
governed by Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.  (ORC 4511.13)

      (3)   A steady white two-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
      (4)   A steady white one-way left-turn arrow: A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
      (5)   A steady red “X”: A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

“walk” or “don’t walk”, or the symbol of a walking person or an upraised palm
are in place, such signals shall indicate the following instructions:
      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles.  The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don’t
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing int his section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.
      (5)   A flashing walking person signal indication has no meaning and
shall not be used.  (ORC 4511.14)

in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, or urine that equals or
exceeds the amount specified in subsection (a)(1)J. hereof, if both of the
following apply:
         A.   The person obtained the controlled substance pursuant to a
prescription issued by a licensed health professional authorized to prescribe
drugs.
         B.   The person injected, ingested, or inhaled the controlled
substance in accordance with the health professional’s directions.
   (e)   Evidence; Tests. 
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of (a)(1)A. of this section or for any equivalent offense, that is
vehicle-related the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn and
analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may be
admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle related, the court may admit evidence on the concentration of
alcohol, drugs of abuse, controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled
substance, or a combination of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum
or plasma, breath, urine or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged
violation as shown by chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three
hours of the time of the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit
specified in this subsection regarding the admission of evidence does not
extend or affect the two-hour time limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as
the maximum period of time during which a person may consent to a chemical test
or tests as described in that section.
   The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this section when a person
submits to a blood, breath, urine or other bodily substance test at the request
of a law enforcement officer under Ohio R.C. 4511.191, or a blood or urine
sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant.  Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician-intermediate, an emergency
medical
technician-paramedic or a qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist shall
withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the alcohol, drug,
controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination
content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This limitation does
not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person authorized to
withdraw blood under this subsection may refuse to withdraw blood under this
subsection, if in that person’s opinion, the physical welfare of the person
would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.
The bodily substance withdrawn under subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof shall be
analyzed in accordance with methods approved by the Director of Health by an
individual possessing a valid permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in subsection (e)(1)B. of this section, “emergency
medical technician-intermediate” and “emergency medical technician- paramedic”
have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for
violation of subsection (a) of this section or for an equivalent offense that
is vehicle related, if there was at the time the bodily substance was withdrawn
a concentration of less than the applicable concentration of alcohol specified
in subsections (a)(1)B., C., D. and E. of this section, or less than the
applicable concentration of a listed controlled substance or a listed
metabolite of a controlled substance specified for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)J. of this section, that fact may be considered with other competent
evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  This
subsection does not limit or affect a criminal prosecution or juvenile court
proceeding for a violation of subsection (b) of this section or for an
equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to that subsection.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person’s attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.
If the chemical test was obtained pursuant to subsection (e)(1)B.  hereof, the
person tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified
technician, chemist or phlebotomist of the person’s own choosing administer a
chemical test or tests, at the person’s expense, in addition to any
administered at the request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was
under arrest as described in division (A)(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the
arresting officer shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that the
   person may have an independent chemical test taken at the person’s own
expense.  If the person was under arrest other than described in division (A)
(5) of Ohio R.C. 4511.191, the form to be read to the person to be tested, as
required under Ohio R.C. 4511.192, shall state that the person may have an
independent test performed at the person’s expense.  The failure or inability
to obtain an additional chemical test by a person shall not preclude the
admission of evidence relating to the chemical test or tests taken at the
request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in subsections (e)(4)B. and C. of this section,
“national highway traffic safety administration” means the National Traffic
Highway Safety Administration established as an administration of the United
States Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C.A.
105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of subsection (a), (b) or (d) of this section, of a municipal
ordinance relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol,
a drug of abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator or person in physical
control of the vehicle involved in the violation and if it is shown by clear
and convincing evidence that the officer administered the test in substantial
compliance with the testing standards for any reliable, credible, and generally
accepted field sobriety tests that were in effect at the time the tests were
administered, including, but not limited to, any testing standards then in
effect that were set by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all
of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
subsection (e)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Subsection (e)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that
subsection, from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise
disallowed by subsection (e)(4)B. of this section.  (ORC 4511.19; 4511.194)
   
   (f)   Forensic Laboratory Reports. 
      (1)   Subject to subsection (f)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of subsection (a)
(1)B., C., D., E., F., G., H., I., or J. or (b)(1), (2), (3) or (4) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is substantially equivalent to any of
those subsections, a laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a
permit by the Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this
subsection that contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, urine, or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the
information specified in this subsection shall be admitted as prima- facie
evidence of the information and statements that the report contains.  The
laboratory report shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director or a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst’s or test performer’s
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst’s or test performer’s regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst’s or test performer’s education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this
section is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any
proceeding, other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless
the prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant’s attorney or,
if the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in subsection (f)(1) of this section
shall not be prima-facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant’s attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant’s attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the
report.  The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the
interest of justice.
   (g)   Immunity From Liability For Withdrawing Blood.  Except as otherwise
provided in this subsection, any physician, registered nurse, emergency medical
technician-intermediate, emergency medical technician-paramedic, or qualified
technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who withdraws blood from a person pursuant
to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid
station, or clinic at which blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this
section or Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability
and civil liability based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other
claim that is not a claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing
blood from the person.  The immunity provided in this subsection also extends
to an emergency medical service organization that employs an emergency medical
technician-intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws
blood under this section.  The immunity provided in this subsection is not
available to a person who withdraws blood if the person engaged in willful or
wanton misconduct.
   As used in this subsection, “emergency medical technician-intermediate” and
“emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C.
4765.01.
   (h)   General OVI Penalty. 
      (1)   Whoever violates any provision of subsections (a)(1)A. to I. or (a)
(2) of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle under the influence of
alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them.  Whoever violates
subsection (a)(1)J. of this section is guilty of operating a vehicle while
under the influence of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of
a controlled substance.  The court shall sentence the offender for either
offense under Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, and this Traffic Code, except as
otherwise authorized or required by subsections (h)(1)A. to E. of this section:
         A.   Except as otherwise provided in subsections (h)(1)B., C., D. or
E. of this section, the offender is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first
degree, and the court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of
subsections (a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail
term of three consecutive days.  As used in this subsection, three consecutive
days means seventy-two consecutive hours.  The court may sentence an offender
to both an intervention program and a jail term.  The court may impose a jail
term in addition to the three-day mandatory jail term or intervention program. 
However, in no case shall the cumulative jail term imposed for the offense
exceed six months.
The court may suspend the execution of the three-day jail term under this
subsection if the court, in lieu of that suspended term, places the offender
under a community control sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 and requires
the offender to attend, for three consecutive days, a drivers’ intervention
program certified under Ohio R.C. 5119.38.
The court also may suspend the execution of any part of the three-day jail term
under this subsection if it places the offender under a community control
sanction pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2929.25 for part of the three days, requires the
offender to attend for the suspended part of the term a drivers’ intervention
program so certified, and sentences the offender to a jail term equal to the
remainder of the three consecutive days that the offender does not spend
attending the program.  The court may require the offender, as a condition of
community control and in addition to the required attendance at a drivers’
intervention program, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services
that the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the
offender should attend and to report periodically to the court on the
offender’s progress in the programs.  The court also may impose on the offender
any other conditions of community control that it considers necessary.
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.1. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of at least three consecutive days
and a requirement that the offender attend, for three consecutive days, a
drivers’ intervention program that is certified pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5119.38. 
As used in this subsection, three consecutive days means seventy-two
consecutive hours.  If the court determines that the offender is not conducive
to treatment in a drivers’ intervention program, if the offender refuses to
attend a drivers’ intervention program, or if the jail at which the offender is
to serve the jail term imposed can provide a drivers’ intervention program, the
court shall sentence the offender to a mandatory jail term of at least six
consecutive days. 
If the court grants unlimited driving privileges to a first-time offender under
Ohio R.C. 4510.022, all penalties imposed upon the offender by the court under
subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section for the offense apply, except that the
court shall suspend any mandatory or additional jail term imposed by the court
under subsection (h)(1)A.2. of this section upon granting unlimited driving
privileges in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
The court may require the offender, under a community control sanction imposed
under Ohio R.C. 2929.25, to attend and satisfactorily complete any treatment or
education  programs that comply with the minimum standards adopted pursuant to
Ohio R.C. Chapter 5119 by the Director of Mental Health and Addiction Services,
in addition to the required attendance at drivers’ intervention program, that
the operators of the drivers’ intervention program determine that the offender
should attend and to report periodically to the court on the offender’s
progress in the programs.  The court also may impose any other conditions of
community control on the offender that it considers necessary.
            3.   In all cases, a fine of not less than three hundred seventy-
five dollars ($375.00) and not more than one thousand seventy-five dollars
($1,075).
            4.   In all cases, a suspension of the offender’s driver’s or
commercial driver’s license or permit or nonresident operating privilege for a
definite period of one to three years.  The court may grant limited driving
privileges relative to the suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13. 
The court may grant unlimited driving privileges with an ignition interlock
device relative to the suspension and may reduce the period of suspension as
authorized under Ohio R.C. 4510.022.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in subsection (h)(1)E. of this
section, an offender who, within ten years of the offense, previously has been
convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of subsection (a) or (b) of
this section or one other equivalent offense is guilty of a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
            1.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)A., B., C., D., E., or J. of this section, a mandatory jail term of ten
consecutive days.                 The court shall impose the ten-day mandatory
jail term under this subsection unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this
section, it instead imposes a sentence under that subsection consisting of both
a jail term and a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with
continuous alcohol monitoring, or with both electronic monitoring and
continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court may impose a jail term in addition to
the ten-day mandatory jail term.  The cumulative jail term imposed for the
offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community
addiction services provider that is authorized by Ohio R.C. 5119.21, subject to
subsection (k) of this section, and shall order the offender to follow the
treatment recommendations of the services provider.  The purpose of the
assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection
(a)(1)F., G., H. or I. or (a)(2) of this section, except as otherwise provided
in this subsection, a mandatory jail term of twenty consecutive days.  The
court shall impose the twenty-day mandatory jail term under this subsection
unless, subject to subsection (h)(3) of this section, it instead imposes a
sentence under that subsection consisting of both a jail term and a term of
house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring, or
with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.  The court
may impose a jail term in addition to the twenty-day mandatory jail term.  The
cumulative jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed six months.
In addition to the jail term or the term of house arrest with electronic
monitoring or continuous alcohol monitoring or both types of monitoring and
jail term, the court shall require the offender to be assessed by a community

assessment is to determine the degree of the offender’s alcohol usage and to
determine whether or not treatment is warranted.  Upon the request of the
court, the services provider shall submit the results of the assessment to the
court, including all treatment recommendations and clinical diagnoses related
to alcohol use.
            3.   In all cases, notwithstanding the fines set forth in Section
303.99, a fine of not less than five hundred twenty-five dollars ($525.00) and
not more than one thousand six hundred twenty-five dollars ($1,625).

commercial driver’s license, temporary instruction permit, probationary
license, or nonresident operating privilege for a definite period of one to
seven years.  The court may grant limited driving privileges relative to the
suspension under Ohio R.C. 4510.021 and 4510.13.  (ORC 4511.19)

jail term imposed for the offense shall not exceed one year.
            2.   If the sentence is being imposed for a violation of subsection

      (3)   If an offender is sentenced to a jail term under subsection (h)
(1)B.1. or 2. or (h)(1)C.1. or 2. of this section and if, within sixty days of
sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written finding on the record
that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the offender is
required to serve the term, the offender will not be able to begin serving that
term within the sixty-day period following the date of sentencing, the court
may impose an alternative sentence under this subsection that includes a term
of house arrest with electronic monitoring, with continuous alcohol monitoring,
or with both electronic monitoring and continuous alcohol monitoring.
As an alternative to a mandatory jail term of ten consecutive days required by
subsection (h)(1)B.1. of this section, the court, under this subsection, may

   (a)   (1)   No person, except those expressly exempted under Ohio R.C.
4507.03, 4507.04, and 4507.05, shall operate any motor vehicle upon a public

or highway or any public or private property used by the public for purposes of
vehicular travel or parking in this Municipality unless the person has a valid
license as a motorcycle operator that was issued upon application by the
Registrar of Motor Vehicles under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507.  The license shall be
in the form of an endorsement, as determined by the Registrar, upon a driver’s

motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle, or in the form of a restricted
license as provided in Ohio R.C. 4507.14, if the person does not have a valid
license to operate a motor vehicle or commercial motor vehicle.
   (b)   Upon the request or motion of the prosecuting authority, a
noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and social security number of a person charged with a
violation of subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may be admitted into
evidence as prima-facie evidence that the person did not have either a valid
driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or a restricted license at the time of the alleged violation of
subsection (a)(2) of this section.  The person charged with a violation of
subsection (a)(1) or (2) of this section may offer evidence to rebut this
prima-facie evidence.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of operating a motor vehicle
or motorcycle without a valid license and shall be punished as follows:
      (1)   If the trier of fact finds that the offender never has held a valid

The failure of an offender to complete a term of community service imposed by
the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt under division (A) of
Ohio R.C. 2705.02 that may be filed in the underlying case. If the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of Ohio
R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this subsection, the offense is a
minor misdemeanor.  If, within three years of the offense, the offender
previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of
Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the
offense is a misdemeanor of the first degree.
   (d)   The court shall not impose a license suspension for a first violation
of this section or if more than three years have passed since the offender’s
last violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.

three years of the offense the offender previously was convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more violations of Ohio R.C. 4510.12 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, and if the offender’s license was expired for
more than six months at the time of the offense, the court may impose a class
seven suspension of the offender’s driver’s license, commercial driver’s
license, temporary instruction permit, probationary license, or nonresident
operating privilege from the range specified in division (A)(7) of Ohio R.C.
4510.02.

to, the fact that the employer, school official, or official affiliated with a
religious event provided the holder of a  probationary driver’s license with
the written documentation described in subsection (a)(2) of this section.
The Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall make available at no cost a form to serve

member occupying the vehicle unless the probationary license holder is
accompanied by the probationary license holder’s parent, guardian or custodian.
   (b)   It is an affirmative defense to a violation of subsection (a)(1)A. or

over the violation may order that the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle

holder’s parent or guardian during the period of time determined by the court
under that subsection.  In granting the driving privileges, the court shall
specify the purposes of the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate
forms setting forth the privileges granted.  If a person is convicted of,
pleads guilty to, or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a
second or subsequent moving violation, the court with jurisdiction over the
violation may terminate any driving privileges previously granted under this
division.
      (3)   No person shall violate any operating restriction imposed under

occupant restraining device.
   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated

determining whether each occupant of the motor vehicle is wearing all of the
available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device as
required by subsection (d) hereof, or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket,
citation, or summons if the requirement in that subsection has been or is being
violated, or for causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution of a person
for a violation of that requirement.
   (f)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause the operator of a motor vehicle being operated
on any street or highway to stop the motor vehicle for the sole purpose of

   (d)   The filing of a sworn complaint against a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.205 does not preclude the filing of a sworn complaint for a
violation of a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for the same
conduct.  However, if a person is adjudicated a delinquent child or a juvenile
traffic offender for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.205 and is also adjudicated

person’s failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person’s license
on or about the person’s person shall be prima-facie evidence of the person’s
not having obtained a driver’s license.

this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor.  When the offense is an

the underlying case.
      (2)   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of Ohio R.C.

section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of subsection (b) of this section.  The
person charged with a violation of subsection (a) or (b) of this section may

under subsection (c)(5) of this section.  The information provided and included
in the database under subsection (c)(5) of this section is not a public record
subject to inspection or copying under Ohio R.C. 149.43.
   (d)   Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, no law
enforcement officer shall cause an operator of an automobile being operated on
any street or highway to stop the automobile for the sole purpose of
determining whether a violation of subsection (b) hereof has been or is being
committed or for the sole purpose of issuing a ticket, citation or summons for
a violation of that nature or causing the arrest of or commencing a prosecution
of a person for a violation of that nature, and no law enforcement officer
shall view the interior or visually inspect any automobile being operated on
any street or highway for the sole purpose of determining whether a violation
of that nature has been or is being committed.

person to ensure that each minor who is a passenger of an automobile being
operated by that person is wearing all of the available elements of a properly
adjusted occupant restraining device, in violation of subsection (b)(2)  of
this section, shall not be considered or used by the trier of fact in a tort
action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other
than a prosecution for a violation of this section; and shall not be admissible
as evidence in a criminal action involving the person other than a prosecution
for a violation of this section.

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:
         A.     It seeks to recover damages for injury or death to the
occupant.
         B.   The defendant in question is the manufacturer, designer,
distributor or seller of the passenger car.
         C.   The claim for relief against the defendant in question is that
the injury or death sustained by the occupant was enhanced or aggravated by
some design defect in the passenger car or that the passenger car was not
crashworthy.
   (g)   (1)   Whoever violates subsection (b)(1) of this section shall be
fined thirty dollars ($30.00).

      (2)   As used in this subsection:
         A.   An “offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant” includes, but is not limited to, a violation of Ohio R.C.
101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, division (F) or (H) of Ohio R.C. 102.03,
division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2921.02, division (A) or (B) of Ohio R.C. 2921.43, or
division (F) or (G) of Ohio R.C. 3517.13, that is directly related to an
offense involving misconduct in office of a public servant.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Section
525.01 .
   (d)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused's accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (e)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process, unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (f)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused absented himself
from this Municipality or concealed his identity or whereabouts is prima-facie
evidence of his purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (i)   The period of limitation for a violation of any provision of this
General Offenses Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under eighteen years of age or of a child with a developmental
disability or physical impairment under twenty-one years of age shall not begin
to run until either of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.  (ORC 2901.13)
   (j)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one subsection
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that subsection does not by itself plainly indicate a
purpose to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other
subsections of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses
defined in the Traffic Code.
      (3)   Subsection (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution
of the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   Possession is a voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
      (2)   Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during unconsciousness or
sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product of the actor's
volition, are involuntary acts.
      (3)   "Culpability" means purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence,
as defined in Section
501.08 .
      (4)   “Intoxication” includes, but is not limited to, intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug. 
         (ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
 
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature.  A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. 
   When knowledge of the existence of a particular fact is an element of an
offense, such knowledge is established if a person subjectively believes that
there is a high probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts
with a conscious purpose to avoid learning the fact.
 
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person perversely disregards a substantial and unjustifiable
risk that the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely
to be of a certain nature.  A person is reckless with respect to circumstances
when, with heedless indifference to the consequences, the person perversely
disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are
likely to exist.
 
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
 
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element. 
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
 
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
 
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
 
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor’s effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
 
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense.  An attempt to commit a drug abuse offense for which the penalty is
determined by the amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
involved in the drug abuse offense is an offense of the same degree as the drug
abuse offense attempted would be if that drug abuse offense had been committed
and had involved an amount or number of unit doses of the controlled substance
that is within the next lower range of controlled substance amounts than was
involved in the attempt.  An attempt to commit any other misdemeanor is a
misdemeanor of the next lesser degree than the misdemeanor attempted.  In the
case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a violation of Ohio R.C.
Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt is a misdemeanor
of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony under the Ohio Revised
Code, and a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a
misdemeanor.  An attempt to commit a minor misdemeanor is not an offense under
this section. 
 
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
 
"The testimony of an accomplice does not become inadmissible because of his
complicity, moral turpitude or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed
complicity of a witness may affect his credibility and make his testimony
subject to grave suspicion, and require that it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, "organization" means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  "Organization" does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.  (ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.  (ORC
2901.24)
501.13  REIMBURSEMENT FOR COSTS OF CONFINEMENT.
   The Village Solicitor is hereby authorized, pursuant to Ohio R.C. 753.02 to
seek reimbursement from prisoners for expenses of their confinement.
(Ord. 95-28.  Passed 8-17-95.)
501.14  CONSPIRACY.

electronic mail messages or unauthorized access of a computer in violation of
Ohio R.C. 2923.421 or the commission of a violation of any provision of Ohio
R.C. Chapter 3734, other than Ohio R.C. 3734.18, that relates to hazardous
wastes, shall do either of the following:
      (1)   With another person or persons, plan or aid in planning the
commission of any of the specified offenses;
      (2)   Agree with another person or persons that one or more of them will
engage in conduct that facilitates the commission of any of the specified
offenses.
   (b)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy unless a substantial overt
act in furtherance of the conspiracy is alleged and proved to have been done by
the accused or a person with whom the accused conspired, subsequent to the
accused’s entrance into the conspiracy.  For purposes of this section, an overt
act is substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the
part of the actor that the object of the conspiracy should be completed.
   (c)   When the offender knows or has reasonable cause to believe that a
person with whom the offender conspires also has conspired or is conspiring
with another to commit the same offense, the offender is guilty of conspiring
with that other person, even though the other person’s identity may be unknown
to the offender.
   (d)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the conspiracy was impossible
under the circumstances.
   (e)   A conspiracy terminates when the offense or offenses that are its
objects are committed or when it is abandoned by all conspirators.  In the
absence of abandonment, it is no defense to a charge under this section that no
offense that was the object of the conspiracy was committed.
   (f)   A person who conspires to commit more than one offense is guilty of
only one conspiracy, when the offenses are the object of the same agreement or
continuous conspiratorial relationship.
   (g)   When a person is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a
specific offense or of complicity in the commission of or attempt to commit the
specific offense, the person shall not be convicted of conspiracy involving the
same offense.
   (h)   (1)   No person shall be convicted of conspiracy upon the testimony of
a person with whom the defendant conspired, unsupported by other evidence.
      (2)   If a person with whom the defendant allegedly has conspired
testifies against the defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged
with conspiracy and if the testimony is supported by other evidence, the court,
when it charges the jury, shall state substantially the following:
   “The testimony of an accomplice that is supported by other evidence does not
become inadmissible because of the accomplice’s complicity, moral turpitude, or
self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity of a witness may affect
the witness’ credibility and make the witness’ testimony subject to grave
suspicion, and requires that it be weighed with great caution.
   It is for you, as jurors, in light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth”.
      (3)   “Conspiracy”, as used in subsection (h)(1) of this section, does
not include any conspiracy that results in an attempt to commit an offense or
in the commission of an offense.
      
   (i)   The following are affirmative defenses to a charge of conspiracy:
      (1)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor thwarted the
success of the conspiracy under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of the actor’s criminal purpose.
      (2)   After conspiring to commit an offense, the actor abandoned the
conspiracy prior to the commission of or attempt to commit any offense that was
the object of the conspiracy, either by advising all other conspirators of the
actor’s abandonment, or by informing any law enforcement authority of the
existence of the conspiracy and of the actor’s participation in the conspiracy.
   (j)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of conspiracy, which is a
misdemeanor of the first degree, when the most serious offense that is the
object of the conspiracy is a felony of the fifth degree.
   (k)   This section does not define a separate conspiracy offense or penalty
where conspiracy is defined as an offense by one or more sections of this Code,
other than this section.  In such a case, however:
      (1)   With respect to the offense specified as the object of the
conspiracy in the other section or sections, subsection (a) hereof defines the
voluntary act or acts and culpable mental state necessary to constitute the
conspiracy;
      (2)   Subsections (b) to (i) hereof are incorporated by reference in the
conspiracy offense defined by the other section or sections of this Code.
   (l)   (1)   In addition to the penalties that otherwise are imposed for
conspiracy, a person who is found guilty of conspiracy to engage in a pattern
of corrupt activity is subject to divisions (B)(2) and (3) of Ohio R.C.
2923.32, division (A) of Ohio R.C. 2981.04 and division (D) of Ohio R.C.
2981.06.
      (2)   If a person is convicted of or pleads guilty to conspiracy and if
the most serious offense that is the object of the conspiracy is a felony drug
trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense, in addition to
the penalties or sanctions that may be imposed for the conspiracy under
subsection (j) hereof and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, both of the following apply:
         A.   The provisions of divisions (D), (F) and (G) of Ohio R.C.
2925.03, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.04, division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.05,
division (D) of Ohio R.C. 2925.06 and division (E) of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that
pertain to mandatory and additional fines, driver’s or commercial driver’s
license or permit suspensions, and professionally licensed persons and that
would apply under the appropriate provisions of those divisions to a person who
is convicted of or pleads guilty to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing,
processing, or possession offense that is the most serious offense that is the
basis of the conspiracy shall apply to the person who is convicted of or pleads
guilty to the conspiracy as if the person had been convicted or pleaded guilty
to the felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession offense
that is the most serious offense that is the basis of the conspiracy.
         B.   The court that imposes sentence upon the person who is convicted
of or pleads guilty to the conspiracy shall comply with the provisions
identified as being applicable under subsection (l)(2) of this section, in
addition to any other penalty or sanction that it imposes for the conspiracy
under subsection (j) of this section and Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929.
   (m)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Felony drug trafficking, manufacturing, processing or possession
offense” means any of the following that is a felony:
         A.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.03, 2925.04, 2925.05, or 2925.06;
         B.   A violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.11 that is not a minor drug
possession offense.
      (2)   “Minor drug possession offense” has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 2925.01.  (ORC 2923.01)
   
501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Financial Sanctions.  In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2947.23, the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor committed under the Codified Ordinances, including a minor
misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or combination
of financial sanctions authorized under this section.  If the court in its
discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial sanctions
that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not limited to,
the following:
      (1)   Restitution.  Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor
or could be disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court
under Traffic Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the
offender’s crime or any survivor of the victim, in an amount based on the
victim’s economic loss.  The court may not impose restitution as a sanction
pursuant to this section if the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be
disposed of by the traffic violations bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13.  If the court requires restitution, the court shall order that the
restitution be made to the victim in open court or to the adult probation
department that serves the jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of
the victim.
   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine the amount of
restitution to be paid by the offender.  If the court imposes restitution, the
court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by
the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or
receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other
information, provided that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not
exceed the amount of the economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and
proximate result of the commission of the offense.  If the court decides to
impose restitution, the court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution
if the offender, victim or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the
court holds an evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has
the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of
restitution sought from the offender.
All restitution payments shall be credited against any recovery of economic
loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any survivor of the victim
against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence of an award of
restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of imposing
liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the offender pay a
surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
The victim or survivor may request that the prosecutor in the case file a
motion, or the offender may file a motion, for modification of the payment
terms of any restitution ordered.  If the court grants the motion, it may
modify the payment terms as it determines appropriate.
      (2)   Fines.  A fine in the following amount:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one thousand
dollars ($1,000);
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five hundred
dollars ($500.00);
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two hundred
fifty dollars ($250.00);
         E.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty dollars
($150.00).
      (3)   Reimbursement of costs of sanctions.
         A.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
            1.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community control
sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
            2.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined.
         B.   The amount of reimbursement ordered under subsection (a)(3)A. of
this section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is
able to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions.  The court
may collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under
that subsection.  If the court does not order reimbursement under that
subsection, confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy
adopted under Ohio R.C. 2929.37.  In addition, the offender may be required to
pay the fees specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
            (ORC 2929.28)
   (b)   Jail Terms. 
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 of the Revised
Code, and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant to law, if the
sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor elects
or is required to impose a jail term on the offender pursuant to this General
Offenses Code, the court shall impose a definite jail term that shall be one of
the following:   
      A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one hundred
eighty days;
      B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than ninety days;
      C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than sixty days;
      D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than thirty days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under this
section may permit the offender to serve the sentenced in intermittent
confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as provided in
Ohio R.C. 2929.26(B).  The court retains jurisdiction over every offender
sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at any time, but the
court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2935.01, has filed
a notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case.  The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
      2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the

subsection, “counseling services” include services provided in an informal

533.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   "Sexual conduct" means vaginal intercourse between a male and female;
anal intercourse, fellatio and cunnilingus between persons regardless of sex;
and, without privilege to do so, the insertion, however slight, of any part of
the body or any instrument, apparatus or other object into the vaginal or anal
opening of another.  Penetration, however slight, is sufficient to complete
vaginal or anal intercourse.
   (b)   "Sexual contact" means any touching of an erogenous zone of another,
including without limitation the thigh, genitals, buttock, pubic region, or, if
such person is a female, a breast, for the purpose of sexually arousing or
gratifying either person.
   (c)   "Sexual activity" means sexual conduct or sexual contact, or both.
   (d)   "Prostitute" means a male or female who promiscuously engages in
sexual activity for hire, regardless of whether the hire is paid to the
prostitute or to another.
   (e)   “Harmful to juveniles” means that quality of any material or
performance describing or representing nudity, sexual conduct, sexual
excitement, or sado- masochistic abuse in any form to which all of the
following apply:
      (1)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, appeals to
the prurient interest of juveniles in sex.
      (2)   The material or performance is patently offensive to prevailing
standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable
for juveniles.
      (3)   The material or performance, when considered as a whole, lacks
serious literary, artistic, political and scientific value for juveniles.
   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary
adults, or, if it is designed for sexual deviates or other specially
susceptible group, judged with reference to such group, any material or
performance is "obscene" if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;
      (2)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
sexual activity, masturbation, sexual excitement or nudity in a way which tends
to represent human beings as mere objects of sexual appetite;
      (3)   Its dominant tendency is to arouse lust by displaying or depicting
bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality;
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by
displaying or depicting human bodily functions of elimination in a way which
inspires disgust or revulsion in persons with ordinary sensibilities, without
serving any genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or artistic
purpose;
      (5)   It contains a series of displays or descriptions of sexual
activity, masturbation, sexual excitement, nudity, bestiality, extreme or
bizarre violence, cruelty or brutality, or human bodily functions of
elimination, the cumulative effect of which is a dominant tendency to appeal to
prurient or scatological interest, when the appeal to such interest is
primarily for its own sake or for commercial exploitation, rather than
primarily for a genuine scientific, educational, sociological, moral or
artistic purpose.
   (g)   "Sexual excitement" means the condition of human male or female
genitals when in a state of sexual stimulation or arousal.
   (h)   "Nudity" means the showing, representation or depiction of human male

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)   If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is either
irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial time,
effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)   If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)   As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
 
   (c)    Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this

this section that the defendant acted with the consent of the other person.
   (c)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of arson, a misdemeanor of the
first degree.  If the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is one thousand dollars ($1,000) or more, arson is a felony and shall
be prosecuted under appropriate State law.

radioactive material, caustic or corrosive material, or other inherently
dangerous agency or substance.

endangering, a misdemeanor of the second degree.  If violation of this section
creates a risk of physical harm to any person, criminal damaging or endangering
is a misdemeanor of the first degree.  If the property involved in a violation
is an aircraft, an aircraft engine, propeller, appliance, spare part, or any
other equipment or implement used or intended to be used in the operation of an
aircraft and if the violation creates a risk of physical harm to any person or

multiple victims or a scheme or course of conduct as described in subsection
(b)(2) of this section.  While it is not necessary to separately allege and
prove each offense in the series in order to prosecute a single offense under
subsection (b)(1) or (2) hereof, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a
single offense to prove the aggregate value of the property or services in
order to meet the requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector's item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that is either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount that would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under subsection (c)(1) hereof, and which retains substantial utility for its
purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing the
property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under subsections (c)(1) or (2) hereof, and the value of services, is the fair
market value of the property or services.  As used in this section, "fair
market value" is the money consideration that a buyer would give and a seller
would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is willing to
buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed as to all
facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any compulsion to
act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence that may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is
prima-facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest market quotation prior to the offense, is prima-facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima-facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services that may be received by the
instrument, is prima-facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting ina
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima-facie evidence of the value of the
services.  (ORC 2913.61)

of rainwater into the sanitary sewer system.
   (f)   Council requests that the Sewer Department notify those property
owners determined to be in violation of existing legislation, as required, and
to extend the period for compliance for up to ninety (90) days from the
issuance of an order to correct, or otherwise repair, illegal and improper
connections.
   (g)   Council acknowledges that the cost of any corrective actions shall be
the responsibility of the property owner and that this may be an unanticipated
expense for many owners.

   EXHIBIT B
   WATER USERS AGREEMENT
   This agreement entered into between the Village of Cadiz, a public body,
hereinafter called the “Village”, and                                          
                          , hereinafter called “Customer”.  For purposes of
this ordinance, Customers shall be defined as the person or persons owning the
property for which water service is to be provided, said property being outside
the corporate limits of the Village of Cadiz.
   WITNESSETH
   Whereas, the Village is owner and operator of a water utility which is
organized pursuant to the Ordinances of the Village of Cadiz,
   Whereas, the Customer desires to purchase water from the Village and to
enter into a water users agreement as required by the Bylaws and/or Rules and
Regulations of the Village.
   NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants, promises and
agreements herein contained, it is hereby understood and agreed by the parties
hereto as follows:
   The Village shall furnish, subject to the limitation set out in its Bylaws
and/or Rules and Regulations now in force or as hereafter amended, such
quantity of potable water as Customer may desire in connection with Customer’s
occupancy of the following described property:
Lot No.                     Page No.                    Deed Book No.          
     and further described as containing              acres, fronting on  
(route or highway no.)   
or                                     (address)                               
         .
   The Customer agrees to grant to the Village, its successors and assigns, a
perpetual Right- of-Way Easement (Form FmHA 442-20 or equivalent) in, over,
under and upon the above- described land, with the right to erect, construct,
install, and lay, and thereafter use, operate, inspect, repair, maintain,
replace and remove water pipelines and appurtenant facilities, together with
the right to utilize adjoining lands belonging to the Customer for the purpose
of ingress to and egress from the above-described lands.
   The Customer shall install and maintain at the Customer’s expense a service
line which shall begin at the curb stop and extend to the place of use.  The
service line shall connect with the distribution system of the Village at the
nearest place of desired use by the Customer, provided the Village has
determined in advance that the system has sufficient capacity to permit
delivery of water at that point.
   The Customer agrees to comply with and be bound by the Articles, Bylaws and/
or Rules and Regulations of the Village, now in force, or as hereafter duly and
legally supplemented, amended to changed.  The Customer also agrees to pay for
water at such rates, time and place as shall be determined by the Village, and
agrees to the imposition of such penalties for noncompliance as are now set out
in the Village’s Bylaws and/or Rules and Regulations, or which may be hereafter
adopted and imposed by the Village.
   The Customer agrees to pay to the Village a nonrefundable (except as noted
on the next page) tap fee in the amount of $                    * for
residential taps.  Fees and payment for larger taps and nonresidential taps
shall follow the Tap-in Fee Schedule for Customers Outside the Corporate Limits
of the Village of Cadiz prescribed by the Village.
*   Certain restrictions apply, see Tap-in Fee Schedule for Customers Outside
the Corporate  Limits of the Village of Cadiz.
   In the event that water service cannot be made available to the Customer by
the Village for reasonable cause, the Village shall have the right to terminate
this agreement by delivering written notice to the Customer.  Any portion of a
tap fee paid by the Customer shall be refunded.
   The Village shall purchase and install a cutoff valve and may also include a
water meter in each service.  The Village shall have exclusive right to use
such cutoff valve and water meter which remain the property of the Village.
   The Village shall have final authority in any question of location of any
service line connection to its distribution system; shall determine the
allocation of water to Customers in the event of a water shortage; and shall
shut off water to a Customer who allows a connection or extension o be made of
the Customer’s service line for the purpose of supplying water to another
property, if such connection is made without prior approval of the Village.  In
the event the total water supply shall be insufficient to meet all of the needs
of the Customers, or in the event there is an anticipated shortage of water,
the Village may prorate the water available among the various customers on such
basis as is deemed equitable by the governing board, and may also prescribe a
schedule of hours covering use of water for all nonessential purpose by
particular Customers and require adherence thereto to prohibit the use of water
for all nonessential purposes; provided that if at any time the total water
supply shall be insufficient to met all of the needs of all of the Customers,
the Village must first satisfy all of the needs of all of the Customers for
essential domestic purposes before supplying any water for nonessential
purposes, to wit; for livestock purposes and for garden purposes (all livestock
purposes must be met before garden purposes).
   The Customer agrees that no other present or future source of water will be
connected to any waterlines served by the Village’s waterlines and will
disconnect from the present water supply prior to connecting to and switching
to the Village’s system and shall eliminate their present or future cross-
connections in the Customer’s system.
   The Customer shall connect the service lines to the Village’s distribution
system and shall commence to use water from the system on the date the water is
made available to the Customer by the Village.  Water charges to the Customer
shall commence on the date service is turned on, regardless of amount of water
used.
   In the event the Customer shall breach this contract by refusing or failing
to connect a service line to the Village’s distribution system as set forth
above, the Customer agrees to pay the Village a lump sum of one thousand
dollars ($1,000) as liquidated damages.  It is expressly understood and agreed
by the parties hereto that the said amount is agreed upon as liquidated damages
in that a breach by the Customer in either of the respects set forth above
would be difficult, if not impossible, to prove the amount of such damages. 
The parties hereto have computed, estimated and agreed upon said sum in an
attempt to make a reasonable forecast of probable actual loss because of the
difficulty of estimating with exactness the resulting damages.
   The failure to a Customer to pay water charges duly imposed shall result in
the automatic imposition of the following penalties:
   1.   Nonpayment by the close of business of the due date will be subject to
a penalty of ten percent of the delinquent account.
   2.   Nonpayment within ten (10) working days from the due date will result
in the water being shut off from the Customer’s property.
   3.   In the event it becomes necessary for the Village to shut off the water
from a Customer’s property, a fee set by the corporation in its rate schedule
will be charged for a reconnection of the service.
   IN WITNESS WHEREOF, we have executed this agreement this                
day of
                                      , 20           .

   (24)   “Family household”.
      A.   Purpose.  For purposes of the Village of Cadiz Zoning Code, the
definition “Family Household” shall serve as the definition of a Family, in
particular as it relates to the community of single family, two-family, and
multi-family dwelling units.  A Family Household is where one or more persons
occupy a dwelling as a functional unit.  A functional unit is either a family
where one or more persons is related to each other by blood, adoption or
marriage; or where two or more persons, one or more persons whose relationship
is functionally equivalent to a family but who are not related  by blood,
adoption or marriage.  The standards for determining whether a group of
unrelated persons living together constitutes a family household are set forth
in subsection (24)B. hereof.
      B.   Determination of family household status.  The determination by the
Village that a group of specified persons living together as the functional
equivalent of a family may be transferrable with the same exact group of
individuals to another dwelling.  Any such designation, does not however run
with the property when the property is occupied by a different family household
or group of individuals.
         1.   Responsibilities.  - It shall be the responsibility of the
property owner to provide information/evidence as may be required by the
Village as defined herein to document that a family household meets the
functional equivalency test as family.  The Village through its enforcement of
the Zoning Code, shall have the final determination in deciding whether the
functional equivalency test is met.
         2.   Appeals. - Whenever the Village makes a determination or decision
regarding the functional equivalency of a family as part of the enforcement of
the Zoning Code or any other portion of the Codified Ordinances of the Village,
the decision may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.  The Board of
Zoning Appeals shall treat such an appeal in accordance with the process
specified for appeals as defined in Chapter
1123.  The Board may overrule, modify or uphold the decision regarding
functional equivalency only where there is evidence in the record that there
was an error or omission in the original decision of the factors in subsection
24C. hereof.  The following parties have the right to appeal a decision
regarding functional equivalency:
            a.   Any member of the group proposed as a family household;
            b.   The owner of the premises occupied by such group; or
            c.   Any other person that can demonstrate that they have been
aggrieved by the initial decision.
         3.   Factors - The determination of whether a group of unrelated
persons living together are the functional equivalent of a family shall be
based on such of the following factors as may be presented during the
enforcement investigation by the Village.  The presence or absence of any
single factor is not necessarily determinative of whether the unit constitutes
a family.
            a.   The following factors shall be prima facie evidence that the
group of persons living together constitutes a family household:
               i.   The same group of persons, or a majority of them, has
resided together at a different location for a period of no less than six (6)
months, or resided together at the present location for at least twelve (12)
months: and
               ii.   One or two members of the group have executed the lease
for the entire premises, including the entire rental obligation, and there are
no sub-lease, hold harmless or other arrangements to pro-rate the rent or
recover the rent from other members of the group.
         4.   Prima Facie Evidence. - The following factors shall be prima
facie evidence that the group of persons does not constitute a family:
            a.   Individual members of the group have entered into separate
leases for the same premises or parts thereof, with the obligation under each
lease constituting only a portion of the
total periodic rent payment due to the landlord for occupancy of the premises;
and
            b.   The premises are furnished with key-operated locks on
individual rooms or with other means through which one member of the group may
prevent other members of the group from  entering his/her room or portion of
the premises when he/she is not physically present (deadbolts, chains or other
locking devices operated only from the inside of the room) shall not be
considered as evidence of the status of the group.
         5.   The following additional factors shall be considered, to the
extent known or applicable, in determining whether the group of persons
constitutes a family:
            a.   Voter registration by a majority of the eligible members of
the group listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered
evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a family household. 
Voter registration listing other addresses by a majority of the adult members
of the group, or by a majority of those actually registered to vote shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a family.
            b.   Driver’s license held by a majority of the adult members of
the group listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered
evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a family household. 
Driver’s licenses listing other addresses by a majority of the adult members of
the group, or by a majority of those actually holding such licenses shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a family
household.
            c.   The registration of motor vehicles regularly found at the
dwelling listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered
evidence in support of the proposition that the group is a family household. 
The regular presence at the dwelling of one or more motor vehicles belonging to
members of the group and registered at one or more other addresses shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a family
household.
            d.   The filing of tax returns by a majority of the members of the
group listing the address of the group’s dwelling shall be considered evidence
in support of the proposition that the group is a family household.  The filing
of tax returns listing other addresses by members of the group shall be
considered evidence negating the proposition that the group is a family
household.  Evidence that one or more individuals are claimed as dependents on
the income tax return of individuals not resident in the family household shall
be considered evidence that the group is not a family household.
            e.   The presence of minor dependent children regularly residing in
the dwelling unit and enrolled in local schools with one or more members of the
group acting in the role of parents (and primary care-givers) shall be
considered a factor tending to support the proposition that the group is a
family household.
            f.   Evidence that groceries are purchased and meals regularly
prepared for the group as a whole shall be considered evidence in support of
the proposition that the group is a family household.  For purposes of this
factor, weekly joint purchases of groceries and the preparation and sharing of
at least seven meals per week shall be considered “regularly prepared.”
            g.   Any other relevant factor which would be found to represent or
define a family relationship.
      C.   Evidence.  In making the determination of whether the group
constitutes a family household, the decision shall be made based on the
preponderance of the evidence available.  Where there is prima facie evidence
supporting only one side of the proposition, the Village shall make a
determination that is supported by the prima facie evidence, unless compelling
evidence is presented supporting the other side of the proposition.  In the
case of the latter, the compelling evidence should be supported by at least
three of the factors listed in Section
1105.02 (24)B. above.
      D.   Handicap/Disability.  Living arrangements for persons with a
“Handicap” or “Disability” as those terms are defined by local, State or

STANDARDS FOR REHABILITATION
   (a)   A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a
new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the
building and its site and environment.
   (b)   The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. 
The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that
characterize a property shall be avoided.

place and use.  Changes that create a false sense of historic development, such
as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings,
shall not be undertaken.

historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.
   (e)   Distinctive features, finishes and construction techniques or examples
of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.
   (f)   Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than
replaced.  Where a severity of deterioration requires replacement of a
distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color,
texture and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.  Replacement
of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical or
pictorial evidence.
   (g)   Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause
damage to historic materials shall not be used.  The surface cleaning of
structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means
possible.

protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation
measures shall be undertaken.

not destroy historic materials that characterize the property.  The new work
shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing,
size, scale and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the
property and its environment.
   (j)   New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be
undertaken in such as manner that if removed in the future, the essential form
and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

proponents and the opponents.  Robert's Rules of Order (newly revised) should
be available to the Chairman or the City's Law Director to resolve
parliamentary questions while the hearing is underway.  In order to insure a
fair and objective public hearing, the following format is suggested:
   (a)   Open to the Public.  An administrative hearing shall be open to the
public and all persons interested in the outcome of the appeal or application.
   (b)   Record of the Hearing.  The Chairman should oversee that
administrative staff collects and enters all written and oral testimony,
administrative comments, and correspondence into the record of the meeting.
   (c)   Opening of the Hearing. The Chairman should open the hearing at the
stated time.
   (d)   Subject. The Chairman should announce the pending application or
appeal and summarize the standards set forth in this Zoning Code for the
granting of the application or the appeal.
   (e)   Rules of Order.  Participants should be advised that Robert's Rules of
Order shall cover parliamentary issues.
   (f)   Proper Notice.  At this time, recognition that the required public
notice publication was duly made should be entered into the record.
   (g)   Instructions to Potential Witnesses. The Chairman may place reasonable
and equitable limitations on the presentation of evidence and arguments and the
cross-examination of witnesses so that the matter at issue may be heard and
decided without undue delay.  The Chairman should instruct all potential
witnesses that:
      (1)   Any person may be represented by an attorney at law
      (2)   Reasonable but not excessive time for testimony is to be given to
each individual, generally limited to three to five minutes, unless extended by
the Chairman
      (3)   Witnesses are only to testify about specific and direct evidence
and arguments in the form of reliable, probative, and substantial testimony,
i.e. relevant facts; and not unsubstantiated opinions or mere concerns. 
Hearsay evidence should not be considered and should not be allowed in an
arbitrary manner unless the testimony meets standards for trustworthiness and
necessity.
      (4)   The applicant and other parties in interest are entitled to cross-
examine witnesses.
   (h)   Call for Abstentions and Ex Parte Contacts.
      (1)    The Chairman should call for and recognize abstentions by any
member of the Board  in the event that there is a personal bias or conflict of
interest.  The member shall be responsible for explaining the validity of the
nature of the conflict of interest.
      (2)   The Chairman should call for acknowledgment of any prior ex parte
(off-the-record) communications by members of the Board of Zoning Appeals.
      (3)   A member receiving the ex parte communication should summarize the
nature of an oral communication on the record at the hearing so that its
substance may be contested in public by other parties.  Ex parte written
materials received by members of the Board of Zoning Appeals within ten (10)
days of the administrative hearing should be acknowledged by providing copies
to the Chairman for announcement at the hearing and to the Secretary of the
Board of Zoning Appeals so that copies can be distributed.
      (4)   Ex parte communications received by a member more than ten (10)
days prior to the administrative hearing do not need to be acknowledged at the
hearing when they have been made public by submission of a copy or a summary of
the nature of an oral communication to the Secretary of the Board of Zoning
Appeals so that the communication could be timely placed in the applicant's
case file for public inspection and delivered to parties required to receive
notice by mail.
   (i)   Oath of Witnesses.  The Chairman should request that each person who
presents testimony provide their identification and home or business address. 
Further, the Law Director or the Chairman should administer the oath to members
of the administration of the Village and to each member of the public giving
testimony.  The swearing of witnesses should only be conducted as a group where
prior to receiving testimony, the Chairman requires a witness to indicate on
the record that they were sworn.
   (j)   Staff Report and Summary.  The Chairman may call upon Staff to deliver
an assessment or evaluation of the anticipated consequences or impacts of the
development proposed in the application.
      (1)   Members of the Board may ask any questions relevant to the case
during this time.
      (2)   There should be no cross-examination of the Village administration
report on the application by proponents or opponents at this time.
   (k)   Recognition of Proponents.         
      (1)   The Chairman should first call upon the applicant or appellant and
offer the opportunity to make an opening statement and to present evidence in
support of the application or appeal.
      (2)   The Chairman should then offer any persons who wish to present
testimony or evidence supporting the request of the applicant the opportunity
to testify.  Such persons must confine their evidence or testimony to relevant
facts on the question of whether the application or appeal meets the standards
set forth in this Unified Development Ordinance for the granting of such
application or appeal, or for the placement of lawful conditions upon the
granting of the same.
   (l)   Recognition of Opponents. The Chairman should next offer any persons
who wish to present testimony in opposition to the request of the applicant or
appellant to testify. Such persons must confine their evidence or testimony to
relevant facts on the question of whether the application or appeal meets the
standards set forth in the Unified Development Ordinance for the granting of
such application or appeal, or for the placement of lawful conditions upon the
granting of the same.  All public testimony should be directed to the Chairman.
   (m)   Cross-Examination of the Staff Report, Proponents and Opponents.  Once
all initial testimony has been presented to the Board , the Chairman should
request or seek further testimony from members and those who have testified in
the case.  All questions and responses should be directed to the Chairman.
      (1)   The Chairman should first recognize members of the Board  who have
questions regarding the proponents' presentation.  Members should probe views
of witnesses to separate fact from opinion and lay opinion from expert opinion.
      (2)   The Chairman may then call upon members of the City's
administration for any additional testimony or evidence pertaining to the
testimony and evidence which has been presented at the hearing.  Any member of
the administration presenting additional testimony or evidence shall be subject
to further questioning by members of the Board .
   (n)   Rebuttal and Cross-examination of Witnesses. The Chairman shall
recognize proponents and then opponents who desire to submit rebuttal testimony
or to cross-examine witnesses.  All comments or questions shall be directed
through the Chairman.
   (o)   Rebuttal and Closing Statement.  The Chairman should next give the
applicant or appellant the opportunity to present additional evidence and
testimony pertaining to any new matters raised subsequent to the presentation
of his or her case.  The applicant or appellant should also be permitted to
give a closing statement in support of the application, petition, or appeal.
   (p)   Continuance.  If time does not permit adequate deliberation or if
pertinent data needs to be obtained, the Chairman may recess the administrative
hearing until a subsequent special or the next regular meeting to take
additional testimony or until a final decision is made.  No further published
notice of a continued hearing need be made unless a period of six weeks or more
elapses between the initial and continued hearing dates, although the date,
time, and place of a continued hearing must be specified to those in attendance
or to those who later contact the City.
   (q)   Closing the Hearing.  When the Chairman has determined that no further
discussion of the case on the floor is pending, public testimony on the case
should be declared closed and the application or appeal shall be removed to the
Board .
   (r)   Deliberation and Decision.  At the conclusion of the administrative
hearing, the Board  should deliberate upon the application and choose to move
to a vote or to continue the hearing to a later date due to additional follow-
up or to draft the resolution.  Once the Board  chooses to move to a vote, the
motion shall contain a determination of findings of fact and conclusions and
may impose any reasonable conditions necessary to further the purposes or
standards of the Zoning Code.  The Chairman should call the vote at the close
of discussion.
      (Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 5-7-15.)
1123.07  MINUTES.   
   The Board shall keep minutes of all of its proceedings, showing the vote of
each member upon each question, or, if a member is absent or fails to vote,
indicating such fact. The Board shall keep records of its official actions
which shall be filed in the office of the Mayor within ten days of such
actions, and the same shall be a public record.  (Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 5-7-
15.)
1123.08  STANDARDS.
   In considering all appeals and all proposed exceptions or variations to this
Zoning Code, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall, before making any exceptions or
variations from this Zoning Code in a specific case, first determine that it
will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to adjacent property,
unreasonably increase the congestion in public streets, increase the danger of
fire or endanger the public safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established
property values within the surrounding area or in any other respect impair the
public health, safety, comfort, morals or welfare of the inhabitants of the
City.
(Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 5-7-15.)
1123.09  BASIS OF DETERMINATION.
   (a)    The Board of Zoning Appeals may grant area variances and permit any
modification to depart from these Regulations only to the extent necessary to
remove the practical difficulties where unusual or exceptional factors or
conditions require such modification.  The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make
findings on each of the following factors and determine whether the weight of
the evidence would justify variance to the ordnance standards:
      (1)   Whether the alleged unusual topographical or exceptional physical
conditions exist that do not apply generally to other properties or uses in the
same zoning district;
      (2)   Whether the property will yield a reasonable return without the
variance or whether there can be a beneficial use of the property without the
variance (A limitation upon the financial gain from the land in use shall not
in and of itself constitute a hardship);
      (3)   Whether the variance is substantial compared to the extent of other
variances granted (Mere evidence that a variance was previously granted under
similar circumstances shall not be considered sufficient grounds for granting a
Variance);
      (4)   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or adjoining properties suffer a substantial detriment;
      (5)   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services;
      (6)   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge of
the restricting ordnance or whether the basis for the variance is self-created;
      (7)   Whether the problem can be solved by some manner other than the
granting of a variance;
      (8)   Whether any modification granted will not be detrimental to the
public interest nor in conflict with the intent and purpose of these
Regulations and whether substantial justice will be done by granting the
variance.
   (b)    In granting a variance, the Board may attach thereto such conditions
relating to the location of the proposed structure or use or to the duration of
the variance as it may deem necessary in order to further the purposes of this
Zoning Code. The Board may require such evidence and guarantee or bond as it
may deem necessary to insure that all such conditions so attached are being and
will be complied with.
(Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 5-7-15.)
1123.10  APPEALS.
   (a)    A request for a variance from the terms of this Zoning Ordinance
shall not be heard by the Board of Zoning Appeals unless and until a written
application for a variance is submitted to the Zoning Inspector and the Board
of Zoning Appeals containing:
      (1)   Name, address, and phone number of applicants;
      (2)   A site plan, preferably drawn to scale
      (3)   In a case where an applicant is renting the property and/or
building, the applicant shall provide a letter from the property owner
authorizing and supporting the requested variance application.
      (4)   A written description of the project
      (5)   Description of nature of variance requested, citing the specific
provision or code involved;
      (6)   A narrative statement demonstrating that the requested variance
conforms to the following standards:
         A.   That special conditions and circumstances exist which are
peculiar to the land, structure, or building involved and which are not
applicable to the other lands in the same districts;
         B.   That a literal interpretation of the provisions of this
resolution would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other
properties in the same district under the terms of this resolution
         C.   That special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant;
   (b)    A variance shall not be granted unless the Board makes specific
findings of fact based directly on the particular evidence presented to it
which support conclusions that the standards and conditions imposed by this
Zoning Code have been met by the applicant.
(Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 5-7-15.)
1123.11  DECISIONS.
   (a)    Every decision of the Board shall be by resolution or order, each of
which shall contain a full record of the findings of the Board by case number
under one or another of the following headings: appeal, variance, exception or
interpretation, together with all documents pertaining thereto.
   (b)    The Board shall decide all appeals and rule on all applications for
variances or interpretations within ninety days of the date of the initial
hearing, except as such time may be extended by mutual consent.
   (c)    A copy of the Board's written resolution or order, shall be sent to
the applicant not more than ten days after the decision was made.  The letter
may be written by the Zoning Administrator or appropriate staff member. A copy
of the Board's letter will be placed in the appropriate address file.  Such
decisions shall be binding upon all Village employees, officers, boards and
commissions and shall be incorporated in any permit or certificate subsequently
issued to the applicant pursuant to such decision.  Appeals of decisions of the
Board shall be made to the appropriate court of jurisdiction.
   (d)    If the applicant for a variance does not obtain a building permit for
the use within twelve months of the date of the granting of the variance by the
Zoning Board then the variance shall be void.
(Ord. 2015-12.  Passed 5-7-15.)
1123.12  APPLICATION AND FEES.
   Applications for variances and exceptions shall accompanied by a fee as
provided in Section

fees.  The failure of an applicant to make such an additional deposit within
ten (10) days of a written request shall be deemed a withdrawal of the land
development application for review of the land development application.
      (8)   Inspection Fee.
         A.   The Village shall require as part of a developer’s agreement or
otherwise, that prior to the issuance of final approval of a development plan,
which includes proposed public and/or private improvements, the applicant
deposit with the Village such funds, as estimated by the Village is in
accordance with the Village Administrator, for the reasonable and necessary
expenses incurred for the inspection of the improvements during the course of
construction with release or reduction of an improvement bond or financial
security.  In the event that the funds deposited by the  applicant are
determined by the Village to be insufficient to continue to pay in full, the
expenses incurred for such inspections, then the Village may require additional
deposit of funds as may be reasonably calculated to pay in full such fees.  The
failure of the applicant to make such additional deposit after ten (10) days
after a written request will result in the Village directing the Village
Engineer or other consultant to refrain from continuing to conduct such
inspections, and the Village shall be under no obligation to accept or approve
such improvements or issue any occupancy or zoning permit for any residential,
commercial, institutional and/or industrial use until such time as the funds
are deposited and the inspections are performed.  (Ord. 2017-06.  Passed 3-2-

1138.01  INITIATION OF AMENDMENTS.
   Village Council may amend the text of this Zoning Ordinance or the Official
Zoning Map.  Amendments to the text of this Zoning Ordinance and/or the
Official Zoning Map may be initiated by any one of the following methods:
   (a)   Adoption of a resolution by Village Council to initiate an amendment
(with certification to the Planning Commission);
   (b)   Adoption of a motion by the Planning Commission to initiate an
amendment;
   (c)   Village Council acceptance of a petition to initiate an amendment made
by one or more property owners, or their duly appointed representatives, within
an area proposed to be changed or affected by the proposed amendment (with
certification to the Planning Commission).
      (1)   A petition to initiate an amendment shall be submitted pursuant to
Section
1138.01 (a) to (c) and shall include the following, as applicable:
         A.   A proposed Zoning Ordinance text amendment shall provide a
statement of the proposed modifications to the text.
         B.   A proposed amendment to the Official Zoning Map shall provide a
graphic or legal description of the proposed change, adequately describing the
district and area to be modified, including the number of lots to be rezoned. 
Proposed changes to less than eleven (11) parcels of land, as listed on the tax
duplicate, shall require a list of the current property owners within five
hundred (500) feet in any direction from any part of the defined area to be
amended.  Such list shall contain a parcel map and a certified copy of each and
every map page used to obtain the list of names of the property owners being
submitted.
         C.   The petition shall provide evidence or a rationale to justify
that the proposed amendment would result in an equal or better Zoning Ordinance
than that existing.  This may include evidence that the existing Zoning
Ordinance is unreasonable with respect to the particular property, and that it
deprives the property owner of all lawful and reasonable use of the land.  For
the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance, a limitation upon the financial gain, or
actual or potential loss in value from the rezoning of the land in question
shall not constitute unreasonable zoning and shall not render an amendment
invalid.
            1.   If a similar petition has been denied within the previous two
(2) years, Village Council shall summarily deny subsequent non-meritorious
petitions, except with a statement by the Planning Commission of changed or
changing conditions affecting the land sufficient to warrant reconsideration.
            2.   No amendment or change to the Zoning Ordinance may become
effective unless the ordinance proposing it is first certified to the Planning
Commission for consideration and report to Village Council.

proposed amendments.
   (a)   Meeting.  Unless specified in a certification of a resolution or
acceptance of a petition from Village Council, the Planning Commission may
choose whether to hold an advertised Legislative Hearing on a proposed
amendment.  If an advertised Legislative Hearing is held, public notice and the
conduct of the hearing shall follow the requirements of Section
1138.03 .  Where a Legislative Hearing by the Planning Commission is not
mandated by Village Council or considered necessary by the Planning Commission,
the Planning Commission may simply review and act on the proposed legislation
at a regular business meeting without any special notice.
   (b)   Decision by Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall
recommend approval, disapproval, or suggestions for modification of the
proposed amendment to Village Council within thirty (30) days of the close of
the hearing.
      (1)   Nothing shall prevent the Planning Commission from providing a
report on a proposed amendment to Village Council within thirty (30) days of
the date of initiation.  With the permission of Village Council or the
petitioner(s) involved, the Planning Commission may reasonably extend the
period for a report to Village Council for good cause.
      (2)   The Planning Commission may consult with the Zoning Administrator,
the Law Director or other planning consultants to propose suggestions for
reframing or modifying the proposed amendment prior to submission of a
recommendation on the proposed amendment to Village Council.
      (3)   The Planning Commission report shall request the Law Director
prepare the legal form of the proposed amendment for Village Council review and
ensure that the proposed ordinance contains the relevant text, maps, or the
entire Zoning Ordinance proposed for amendment and clearly indicates the

industrial structures; the division or allocation of land as open spaces for
common use by owners, occupants or leaseholds or as easements for the extension
and maintenance of public sewer, water, storm drainage or other public
facilities.
   The division of any parcel of land shown as a unit or as contiguous units on
the last preceding tax roll, into two (2) or more parcels, sites or lots, any
one of which is less than five (5) acres for the purpose, whether immediate or
future, of transfer of ownership, provided, however, that the division or
partition of land into parcels of more than five (5) acres not involving any
new streets or easements of access, and the sale or exchange of parcels between
adjoining lot owners, where such sale or exchange does not create additional
building sites and where the lots resulting are not reduced below minimum sizes
required by law, shall be exempted from the subdivision approval process. (Ord.
2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)
1151.02  INTENT.
   Developments and subdivisions shall be planned, designed and constructed to
take advantage of the natural features of the site in order to utilize the
natural surface drainage, to economize in the construction of sewers, to reduce
the amount of grading and to minimize destruction of trees and topsoil. The
natural features and other distinctive characteristics of the site shall be
integrated into the plan or plat, as required by this section and to the extent
practicable, to create functional variations in the neighborhood and more
attractive building sites.    
(Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)
1151.03  GENERAL SUBDIVISION DESIGN.
   The development of the subdivision shall be based on an analysis of
environmental characteristics of the site.  To the maximum extent possible,
development shall be located and designed so as to preserve the natural
features of the site, avoid areas of environmental sensitivity, and minimize
negative impacts on and alteration of natural features.  The following specific
areas should be preserved as undeveloped open space, to the extent consistent
with reasonable utilization of the land, in accordance with other applicable
state or local regulations:
   (a)   Wetlands, as defined in Section 404, Federal Water Pollution Control
Act Amendments of 1972, subject to field verification by the U.S. Army Corps of

      (Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)
1151.04  LAND NOT SUITED FOR DEVELOPMENT.
   If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed for subdivision
development is unsuitable for development due to flooding, poor drainage,
topography, unsuitable soils, inadequate public facilities, and/or other
condition that may be detrimental to the general health, safety or welfare of
the public, and if it is determined that the land should not be developed for
the purpose proposed, the Planning Commission shall not approve such
subdivision unless adequate methods are proposed by the Owner/Developer for
alleviating the problems that would be created by development of the land.   
   (a)   Land Subject to Flooding.  The subdivision of land or lands within
areas subject to flooding shall be subject to the following requirements:
      (1)   No subdivision or part thereof shall be approved if the proposed
subdivision development will, individually or collectively, significantly
increase flood flows, heights or damages.
      (2)   No subdivision, or part thereof, shall be approved which would
substantially affect the storage capacity of the flood plain.
         (Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)
1151.05  EROSION AND SEDIMENTATION CONTROL.
   Measures shall be taken by the Owner/Developer to minimize erosion and its
impacts during subdivision construction activity.  The Village may require
detailed erosion and sedimentation plans to be submitted if it is determined
that the size and/or scale of the proposed subdivision warrants such action. 
Generally, such a plan shall be required for major subdivisions comprising more
than twenty-five (25) lots or more than fifteen (15) acres, or if the
subdivision is located where average slope exceeds five percent (5%).  Such
plans shall be prepared by a Professional Engineer, and indicate the techniques
to be used to control erosion both during construction and permanently, and
include a schedule for installing same.  Erosion control plans shall be based
on best practices control of erosion on-site, with the objective of eliminating
or minimizing erosion and sedimentation impacts off-site.  Techniques, devices
and/or measures used shall be reviewed and approved by the Village. Review and
cost of review by the Village shall be borne by the Owner/Developer.  All
erosion and sedimentation control devices shall be in place at the start of
construction activity.

   (a)   The following table lists minimum and maximum widths (in feet) and
turning radii for various types of driveways:
   (b)   The table assumes one lane for ingress and one lane for egress. 
Driveway widths shall be measured perpendicular to the centerline of the
driveway at the street right-of-way line.  Driveways that enter a public
roadway at traffic signals shall have the number of lanes as determined by a
capacity analysis.
   (c)   Number of Driveways:  Each lot is permitted to have a single, two way
driveway except in cases where a Traffic Impact Study clearly demonstrates the
benefits of a second driveway from the standpoint of traffic movement. 
Examples of where a second drive may be justified include large corner lots
where driveways on both streets may be desirable and instances where two, one-
way drives are preferred more than one, two-way drive.  There shall not be more
than two access ways abutting on any one street. 
   (d)   Location:  Each point of ingress and/or egress shall not be closer
than thirty (30) feet to an intersecting street right-of-way line. For

industrial development, or driveways that intersect with a collector or
arterial street, all points of ingress and/or egress shall be located no closer
than one hundred (100) feet to the intersection of two thoroughfares, unless
such a distance is shown to be undesirable in a Traffic Impact Study.
   (e)   Alignment:  New driveways shall be aligned with existing driveways
across a street unless such alignment is shown to be undesirable in a Traffic
Impact Study.  Where such alignments are shown to be undesirable, the
centerlines of opposing driveways shall be offset by at least one hundred (100)
feet.
   (f)   Construction Materials:  Each ingress and/or egress driveway shall be
improved with concrete from the street apron to the entrance of the parking
area.
   (g)   Conditional Approval of Driveways:  As part of the Site Plan review
process, a Site Plan may be approved with a specific driveway location under
the condition that an agreement is reached between the property owner and the
Village requiring that such driveway(s) be closed when specific circumstances
are met.  Such circumstances may include the future construction of a service
road on adjacent property, the opportunity for a shared driveway with
development of adjacent property, or other site specific circumstances. This
conditional approval may be required even if the driveway(s) conforms to all
other requirements of this Section.
(Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)
1151.08  LOTS.
   (a)    All lots shall have the required frontage on an improved public
street or an approved private street.
   (b)    Lots in subdivisions located within the Village shall meet the
dimension and area requirements of the zoning district in which such
subdivision is located.  All lots shall also meet the following requirements:
      (1)   All residential lots shall be approximately rectangular in shape,
and should not have a depth in excess of three (3) times their width, except
where extra depth is necessary due to topography and/or natural conditions, or
to meet other requirements of the Planning and Zoning Code.   
      (2)   Double frontage and reverse frontage lots should be avoided, except
where required to provide separation from arterial streets, or to overcome
specific conditions of topography and/or orientation.  In such cases, an
easement shall be provided along the rear lot line across which there shall be
no vehicular access.
      (3)   Whenever possible, residential subdivisions shall be designed so
that corner lots have a larger area than interior lots.
         (Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)

      (1)   The grading of blocks and lots shall be in accordance with the
standards established by the standards of the Village. The plans may be based
on any of the following grading systems:
      (2)   Where there is a ridge along rear lot lines and the lots drain to a
rear yard drain, swale or ditch;
      (3)   Where parts of all lots drain to a swale or ditch along rear lot
lines;
      (4)   Where there is a cross slope the drainage onto adjoining properties
shall be skillfully controlled;
      (5)   Where the land is relatively flat and adequate drainage must be
formed; or
      (6)   A variation of the above conditions.   
   (c)   Grading of Lots.
      (1)   The floor elevation of each building shall be established in proper
relation to the surrounding grade, the driveway and the street.
      (2)   The lot shall be graded so that water drains away from each
building at a minimum grade of two percent (2%).
      (3)   Surface drainage swales shall have a minimum grade of five-tenths
percent (0.5%) and be designed so that surface water will drain into a storm
sewer, drain inlet or natural drainage way.
      (4)   The minimum grades of driveways shall be four-tenths percent (0.4%)
and a maximum of fifteen percent (15%). Grading shall be adjusted so there will
be no abrupt grades in the front yards and alongside lot lines.
      (5)   The grades of earth terraces shall not exceed two and one-half to
one.
      (6)   If a masonry retaining wall exceeds three feet in height, a hedge,
fence or railing shall be provided.
   (d)   Right of Way Grading.
      (1)   All walks and driveways shall be constructed or reconstructed to
conform to the grade on the right of way where the grade has been established.
The surface of all walks shall have a transverse slope of one-fourth inch to
one- half inch per foot with the low side nearest to the curb line.
      (2)   Whenever permission is requested and granted to construct or
reconstruct a walk where the surface of such walk has a transverse slope of a
rate of more than one-half inch to the foot, the permit shall be granted and
received only on the condition that Council may at any time thereafter order
such walks to be reconstructed to the established grade of the right of way,
entirely at the expense of the abutting property owner.
      (3)   In all cases where sidewalks cross a driveway or runway, the full
width of the sidewalk shall conform to the established grade of the sidewalk
adjoining both sides of such driveway or runway, unless permission has been
first obtained from the Mayor or his/her designee. However, in all cases no
less than a three-foot width of sidewalk shall conform to the grade of the
sidewalks adjoining both sides of the driveway or runway.
      (4)   Upon a right of way where the grade has been established but where
the street has not been improved by paving or grading to such grade, walks
shall be constructed in conformity with the established grade or as specified
in the legislation providing for the construction or reconstruction of such
walks, driveways and curb openings. However, when walks are ordered by Council
or are constructed or reconstructed without such order by the owner of property
abutting on a right of way where no grade is established, such walks may be
constructed or reconstructed at such levels and inclinations as may be
prescribed by the Street Superintendent. When such permission is requested of
and granted by the Street Superintendent to construct or reconstruct a walk on
such right of way, it shall be granted and the walk shall be constructed or
reconstructed only on condition that when a grade is established, such walk
shall be removed and reconstructed to the grade which may thereafter be
established by the Street Superintendent for such street, entirely at the
expense of the owner of the property abutting on such street.
      (5)   Whenever a sidewalk is reconstructed to a grade that does not meet
the grade of adjacent existing walks, the person constructing the new sidewalk
shall construct a ramp to eliminate any stub toes or grade inequality. The
materials, workmanship and character of the ramp shall be as determined by the
Street Superintendent.
   (e)   Grading of Streets.  Streets shall be related appropriately to the
topography:
      (1)   A subdivision shall be planned so that as many lots as possible
will be above the street grade.  On irregular topography, streets shall be
designed to avoid extensive cuts and fills and to comply with grading standards
hereinafter established for private driveways and yards as well as for the
streets.  Streets approximately parallel to contour lines shall be adjusted so
that the lots on one side of the street will not be excessively below the
street grade.
      (2)   Grades of streets shall not exceed ten percent (10%) for local
streets, seven percent (7%) for secondary streets and six percent (6%) for
major streets.  However, in no case may streets be constructed with grades
that, in the professional opinion of the Village Engineer, create a substantial
danger to the public safety.  Street grades shall be not less than four-tenths
percent (0.4%) in order to provide adequate surface drainage, provided,
however, approval may be requested to permit a minimum of twenty-five
hundredths percent (0.25%) where necessary because of topographic or other
conditions.
      (3)   Street grades shall conform as closely as practicable to the
original topography.  All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical
curves of sufficient length to provide a smooth transition and clear visibility
for vehicular operations.  A rate of change of grade of three or four percent
(3% or 4%) per 100 feet is the maximum recommended to give at least 100 feet of
sight distance.  Streets shall level off to a grade not exceeding three percent
(3%) for a distance of not less than 100 feet from each side of an
intersection.  (Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-21-14.)
1151.12  SUBDIVISION PROCEDURE.
   Scope.  It shall be unlawful for any person, organization or entity to
subdivide any land within the Village, unless said subdivision complies with
the regulations herein contained.  No plat shall be recorded and no land or lot
shall be sold until said plat has been approved as herein required.  All land
contracts and/or long term leases affecting a present or future subdivision of
land shall be subject to the requirements of the Planning and Zoning Code.  All
subdivisions must be supplied by Village of Cadiz water and sanitary sewer
services.
(Ord. 2014-19.  Passed 8-12-14.)
1151.13  MAJOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
   A Major Subdivision  is a subdivision that meets the criteria in Section
1114.02 (b).  The purpose of the Major Subdivision review provisions is to
ensure adequate review, approval, and recording of development plats, and to
review and approve public and private improvements to be constructed to support
the proposed subdivision.  Commonly, subdivisions are reviewed and approved in
the context of creating developable lots with private development to follow at
a later time.  Major Subdivisions shall be reviewed in two stages: Preliminary
Plat; and the Final Plat. The developer may request an informal Concept
Development Plan Discussion with the Zoning Administrator prior to submitting a
Preliminary Plat.
   (a)   Concept Development Plan Discussion.  Review Requirements and
Procedure: The Concept Development Plan Discussion provides an option for  the
developer to present a proposed subdivision design concept sketches and other
minimal project information to allow a meaningful discussion of Village
subdivision requirements, existing parcel conditions and future plans. This
discussion also ensures that the developer will not be required to expend
excessive moneys time and cost in redrafting Preliminary Plats without some
assurance that the proposed plat has a reasonable chance of approval.
      (1)   A developer may schedule a meeting with the Zoning Administrator to
resolve basic design questions.  The developer may also request an informal
hearing before the Planning Commission to review the plan.

The Plan may be in a freehand sketch form and in pencil, showing the proposed
layout of streets, lots and other features in relation to the nearest existing
public streets, and other pertinent information relative to location,
environment and available services.
      (3)   Variance approval prior to submittal. If a proposed Major
Subdivision requires a request for a subdivision variance, such variance must
be noted prior to approval of a Preliminary Plat.

construction costs of the water and sanitary sewer;
      (2)   A separate bond in the amount of ten (10) percent of the of the
estimated costs of all other improvements;
      (3)   A separate bond in the amount of ten (10) percent of the estimated
costs of all street trees.
   (d)   Assurances and Duration of Maintenance Bonds.  The Maintenance Bonds
shall assure that the  Developer shall maintain and restore the roads and other
improvements until such roads and improvements pass the final inspection of the
Village Engineer within three (3) years of the release of the Performance Bond.
   (e)    Failure to Maintain Improvements. If the Developer fails to perform
maintenance and restoration work, the Mayor may authorize the Village Engineer
to self perform the work or authorize to have the work performed by others. 
The cost of work will be deducted or drawn from the Maintenance Bond.  The
Developer will remain liable for any expenditures over and above recovery
derived from the Maintenance Bond.
   (f)    Release of the Maintenance Bond.  It is the responsibility of the
Developer to request final inspections for release of the Maintenance Bond.
After all maintenance and restoration work has been completed to the
satisfaction of the Village Engineer, the Mayor will release the Maintenance
Bonds or those portions remaining to the developer.  The bonds will remain in
full force and effect until formally released by the Mayor.

1305.01  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization.  Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio
Constitution grants municipalities the legal authority to adopt land use and
control measures for promoting the health, safety and general welfare of its
citizens.  Therefore, the Village of Council of the Village of Cadiz, State of
Ohio, does ordain as follows:
 
   (b)   Findings of Fact.  The Village of Cadiz has special flood hazard areas
that are subject to periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief,
and impairment of the tax base. Additionally, structures that are inadequately
elevated, floodproofed, or otherwise protected from flood damage also
contribute to the flood loss. In order to minimize the threat of such damages
and to achieve the purposes hereinafter set forth, these regulations are
adopted.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose.  It is the purpose of these regulations to
promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
      (4)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
      (7)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions;
      (8)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within
and near flood prone areas;
      (9)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
      (10)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial
values of the floodplain;
      (11)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or
environmentally incompatible; and
      (12)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
   (d)   Methods of Reducing Flood Loss.  In order to accomplish its purposes,
these regulations include methods and provisions for:
      (1)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging
increases in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
      (4)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
      (5)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
   (e)   Lands to Which These Regulations Apply.  These regulations shall apply
to all areas of special flood hazard within the jurisdiction of the Village of
Cadiz as identified in subsection (f) hereof, including any additional areas of
special flood hazard annexed by Village of Cadiz.
   (f)   Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard.  For the
purposes of these regulations, the following studies and/or maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Harrison County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas
and Flood Insurance Rate Map Harrison County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas both
effective 05/04/2009.
      (2)   Other studies and/or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard,
including:
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the Village of Cadiz as required by Section
1305.04 (c).
   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and/or studies are hereby adopted
by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps and/or
studies are on file at the 128 Court Street, Cadiz, Ohio, 43907.
   (g)   Abrogation and Greater Restrictions.  These regulations are not
intended to repeal any existing ordinances (resolutions) including subdivision
regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a conflict between these
regulations and any other ordinance (resolution), the more restrictive shall be
followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed restriction, covenant or
easement but the land subject to such interests shall also be governed by the
regulations.
   (h)   Interpretation.  In the interpretation and application of these
regulations, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes.  Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
   (i)   Warning and Disclaimer of Liability.  The degree of flood protection
required by these regulations is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes
and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can
and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by  man-made
or natural causes. These regulations do not imply that land outside the areas
of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damage. These regulations shall not create liability on the
part of the Village of Cadiz, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal
Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that results from reliance on
these regulations or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
   (j)   Severability.  Should any section or provision of these regulations be
declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall
not affect the validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof
other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.  (Ord. 2009-
06.  Passed 3-19-09.)
1305.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   Accessory Structure:  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   Appeal:  A request for review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a

chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   Base (100-Year) Flood Elevation (BFE):  The water surface elevation of
the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National Geodetic
Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988, and
usually expressed in Feet Mean Sea Level (MSL). In Zone AO areas, the base
flood elevation is the natural grade elevation plus the depth number (from 1 to
3 feet).
   (e)   Basement:  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.

   (h)   Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management):  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA):  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   Fill:  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   Flood or Flooding: A general and temporary condition of partial or
complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM):  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM): An official map on which the Federal
Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   Flood Insurance Risk Zones:  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs that
indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a community.
Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones Al-30 and Zone AE:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the 100-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on sloping
terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base flood
elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99:  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the 100-year
flood to be protected from the 100-year flood by a Federal flood protection
system under construction; no base flood elevations are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded):  Areas of 500-year flood; areas subject
to the 100-year flood with average depths of less than 1 foot or with
contributing drainage area less than 1 square mile; and areas protected by
levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded):  Areas determined to be outside the
500- year floodplain.
   (o)   Flood Insurance Study (FIS):   The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   Flood Protection Elevation:  The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus 0 feet of freeboard. In areas where no base
flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   Floodway:    
      (1)   A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base flood
discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one foot at any
point within the community.
      (2)   The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is usually
characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood waters,
high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high erosion
forces.
   (r)   Freeboard:   A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   Historic structure: Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or,
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
      (4)   Individually listed on the inventory of historic places maintained
by Village of Cadiz's historic preservation program, which program is certified
by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis:  An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   Letter of Map Change (LOMC):  A Letter of Map Change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood Insurance
Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA):  A revision based on technical data
showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special flood
hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective Flood Insurance Rate Map and
establishes that a specific property is not located in a special  flood hazard
area.
      (2)   Letter of Map Revision (LOMR):  A revision based on technical data
that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR): A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
National Flood Insurance Program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and
Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
   (v)   Lowest floor:  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including
basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an "enclosure below the
lowest floor" which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure usable solely
for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area other than a
basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance with the
applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for enclosures
below the lowest floor.
   (w)   Manufactured home:   A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   Manufactured home park:  As specified in the Ohio Administrative Code
3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which three
or more manufactured homes used for habitation are parked, either free of
charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building, structure,
vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the facilities of the
park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual lots are not for
rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of installation of
manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home park, even though
three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the roadways are
dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP):   The NFIP is a Federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the Federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the Federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   New construction:  Structures for which the "start of construction"
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the Harrison County and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map, May 4, 2009, and includes any
subsequent improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   Person:  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio
Revised Code Section 111.15 as any governmental entity of the State and
includes, but is not limited to, any board, department, division, commission,
bureau, society, council, institution, state college or university, community
college district, technical college district, or state community college.
"Agency" does not include the general assembly, the controlling board, the
adjutant general's department, or any court.
   (bb)   Recreational vehicle:  A vehicle which is (1) built on a single
chassis, (2) 400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection, (3) designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a
light duty truck, and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent
dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or
seasonal use.
   (cc)   Registered Professional Architect:  A person registered to engage in
the practice of architecture under the provisions of Sections 4703.01 to
4703.19 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (dd)   Registered Professional Engineer:  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Chapter 4733 of the Revised Code.
   (ee)   Registered Professional Surveyor:  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Chapter 4733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (ff)   Special Flood Hazard Area:  Also known as "Areas of Special Flood
Hazard", it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater
chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are designated
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on Flood Insurance Rate Maps, Flood
Insurance Studies, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps and Flood Hazard Boundary
Maps as Zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood hazard areas may
also refer to areas that are flood prone and designated from other federal,
state or local sources of data including but not limited to historical flood
information reflecting high water marks, previous flood inundation areas, and
flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   Start of construction:  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration  affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   Structure:  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   Substantial Damage:  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before
the damage occurred.
   (jj)   Substantial Improvement:   Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of
construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have
incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered "new
construction,"
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
"historic structure".
   (kk)   Variance:  A grant of relief from the standards of these regulations
consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   Violation:  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.  (Ord. 2009-06.  Passed 3-19-09.)
1305.03  ADMINISTRATION.

         A.   After receipt of a complete application, the Floodplain
Administrator shall review the application to ensure that the standards of
these regulations have been met. No floodplain development permit application
shall be reviewed until all information required in Section
1305.03 (d) has been received by the Floodplain Administrator.
         B.   The Floodplain Administrator shall review all floodplain
development permit applications to assure that all necessary permits have been
received from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which
prior approval is required. The applicant shall be responsible for obtaining
such permits as required including permits issued by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act and Section 404 of the
Clean Water Act, and the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency under Section 401
of the Clean Water Act.
      (2)   Approval.  Within thirty (30) days after the receipt of a complete
application, the Floodplain Administrator shall either approve or disapprove
the application. If an application is approved, a floodplain development permit
shall be issued. All floodplain development permits shall be conditional upon
the commencement of work within one (1) year. A floodplain development permit
shall expire one (1) year after issuance unless the permitted activity has been
substantially begun and is thereafter pursued to completion.
   (f)   Inspections. The Floodplain Administrator shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of construction in order
to monitor compliance with permit conditions.
   (g)   Post-Construction Certifications Required.  The following as-built
certifications are required after a floodplain development permit has been
issued:
      (1)   For new or substantially improved residential structures, or
nonresidential structures that have been elevated, the applicant shall have a
Federal Emergency Management Agency Elevation Certificate completed by a
registered surveyor to record as-built elevation data. For elevated structures
in Zone A and Zone AO areas without a base flood elevation, the elevation
certificate may be completed by the property owner or owner’s representative.
      (2)   For all development activities subject to the standards of Section
1305.03 (j)(1), a Letter of Map Revision.
   (h)   Revoking a Floodplain Development Permit.  A floodplain development
permit shall be revocable, if among other things, the actual development
activity does not conform to the terms of the application and permit granted
thereon. In the event of the revocation of a permit, an appeal may be taken to
the Appeals Board (Variance Board for Counties) in accordance with Section
1305.05 of these regulations.
   (i)   Exemption from Filing a Development Permit.  An application for a
floodplain development permit shall not be required for:
      (1)   Maintenance work such as roofing, painting, and basement sealing,
or, for small nonstructural development activities (except for filling and
grading) valued at less than $5,000.

   Any proposed action exempt from filing for a floodplain development permit
is also exempt from the standards of these regulations.
   (j)   Map Maintenance Activities.  To meet National Flood Insurance Program
minimum requirements to have flood data reviewed and approved by FEMA, and to
ensure that Cadiz flood maps, studies and other data identified in Section
1305.01 (f) accurately represent flooding conditions so appropriate floodplain
management criteria are based on current data, the following map maintenance
activities are identified:
      (1)   Requirement to Submit New Technical Data. 
         A.   For all development proposals that impact floodway delineations
or base flood elevations, the community shall ensure that technical data
reflecting such changes be submitted to FEMA within six months of the date such
information becomes available. These development proposals include:
            1.   Floodway encroachments that increase or decrease base flood
elevations or alter floodway boundaries;
            2.   Fill sites to be used for the placement of proposed structures
where the applicant desires to remove the site from the special flood hazard
area;
            3.   Alteration of watercourses that result in a relocation or
elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts; and
            4.   Subdivision or large scale development proposals requiring the
establishment of base flood elevations in accordance with Section
1305.04(c).
         B.   It is the responsibility of the applicant to have technical data,
required in accordance with Section
1305.03 (j)(1), prepared in a format required for a Conditional Letter of Map
Revision or Letter of Map Revision, and submitted to FEMA.  Submittal and
processing fees for these map revisions shall be the responsibility of the
applicant.
         C.   The Floodplain Administrator shall require a Conditional Letter
of Map Revision prior to the issuance of a floodplain development permit for:
            1.   Proposed floodway encroachments that increase the base flood
elevation; and
            2.   Proposed development which increases the base flood elevation
by more than one foot in areas where FEMA has provided base flood elevations
but no floodway.
         D.   Floodplain development permits issued by the Floodplain
Administrator shall be conditioned upon the applicant obtaining a Letter of Map
Revision from FEMA for any development proposal subject to Section
1305.03 (j)(1)A.
      (2)   Right to Submit New Technical Data.  The Floodplain Administrator
may request changes to any of the information shown on an effective map that
does not impact floodplain or floodway delineations or base flood elevations,
such as labeling or planimetric details. Such a submission shall include
appropriate supporting documentation made in writing by the Mayor of Cadiz, and
may be submitted at any time.
      (3)   Annexation/Detachment.  Upon occurrence, the Floodplain
Administrator shall notify FEMA in writing whenever the boundaries of the
Village of Cadiz have been modified by annexation or the community has assumed
authority over an area, or no longer has authority to adopt and enforce
floodplain management regulations for a particular area. In order that the
Village of Cadiz's Flood Insurance Rate Map accurately represent the  Cadiz
boundaries, include within such notification a copy of a map of the Village of
Cadiz suitable for reproduction, clearly showing the new corporate limits or
the new area for which the Village of Cadiz has assumed or relinquished
floodplain management regulatory authority.
   (k)   Data Use and Flood Map Interpretation.  The following guidelines shall
apply to the use and interpretation of maps and other data showing areas of
special flood hazard:
      (1)   In areas where FEMA has not identified special flood hazard areas,
or in FEMA identified special flood hazard areas where base flood elevation and
floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
      (2)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA
flood maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and
floodway boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width
and/or lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased
base flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
      (3)   When Preliminary Flood Insurance Rate Maps and/or Flood Insurance
Study have been provided by FEMA:
         A.   Upon the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
         B.   Prior to the issuance of a Letter of Final Determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data  may be subject to change and/or appeal to FEMA.
      (4)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where
needed, as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special
flood hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the
boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation
as provided in Section
1305.05 .
      (5)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and
field elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection
elevations (as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established
high water marks, etc.) shall prevail.
   (l)   Substantial Damage Determinations.
      (1)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
         A.    Determine whether damaged structures are located in special
flood hazard areas;
         B.    Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
         C.    Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially
damaged structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior
to repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
      (2)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood
hazard areas; and assist owners of substantially damaged structures with
Increased Cost of Compliance insurance claims.

additional standards are adopted to assure that the reduction of the flood
carrying capacity of watercourses is minimized:
      (1)   Development in Floodways.
         A.   In floodway areas, development shall cause no increase in flood
levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. Prior to issuance of
a floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that the proposed development would not result in any increase in
the base flood elevation; or
         B.   Development in floodway areas causing increases in the base flood
elevation may be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the
applicant:
            1.   Meet the requirements to submit technical data in Section
1305.03 (j)(1);
            2.   An evaluation of alternatives, which would not result in
increased base flood elevations and an explanation why these alternatives are
not feasible;
            3.   Certification that no structures are located in areas that
would be impacted by the increased base flood elevation;

property owners within and outside the community, explaining the impact of the
proposed action on their property; and
            5.   Concurrence of the Mayor of Cadiz and the Chief Executive
Officer of any other communities impacted by the proposed actions.
      (2)   Development in Riverine Areas with Base Flood Elevations but No
Floodways.  
         A.   In riverine special flood hazard areas identified by FEMA where
base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been designated,
the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other
existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the base flood
elevation more than 1.0 (one) foot at any point. Prior to issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a hydrologic and
hydraulic analysis, conducted by a registered professional engineer,
demonstrating that this standard has been met; or,
         B.   Development in riverine special flood hazard areas identified by
FEMA where base flood elevation data are provided but no floodways have been
designated causing more than one foot increase in the base flood elevation may
be permitted provided all of the following are completed by the applicant:
            1.   An evaluation of alternatives which would result in an
increase of one foot or less of the base flood elevation and an explanation why
these alternatives are not feasible;
            2.   Subsection (i)(1)B, items 1. and 3. to 5.
      (3)   Alterations of a Watercourse.  For the purpose of these
regulations, a watercourse is altered when any change occurs within its banks.
The extent of the banks shall be established by a field determination of the
"bankfull stage." The field determination of "bankfull stage" shall be based on
methods presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical
Report RM-245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field
Technique or other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or
other authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a
watercourse, the following standards apply:
         A.   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the 
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
         B.   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of  Water, must be notified
prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such
notification must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
         C.   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Cadiz specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is required,
it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
         D.   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical
data in Section
1305.03 (j)(1)A.3. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the
relocation or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the
placement of culverts.
            (Ord. 2009-06.  Passed 3-19-09.)
1305.05  APPEALS AND VARIANCES.
   (a)   Appeals Board Established. 
      (1)   The Cadiz Zoning Appeals Board is hereby appointed to serve as the
Appeals Board for these regulations as established by the Village of Cadiz
code.
      (2)   A chairperson shall be elected by the members of the Appeals Board.
Meetings of the Appeals Board shall be held as needed and shall be held at the
call of the Chairperson, or in his absence, the Acting Chairperson. All
meetings of the Appeals Board shall be open to the public except that the Board
may deliberate in executive sessions as part of quasi-judicial hearings in
accordance with law. The Appeals Board shall keep minutes of its proceedings
showing the vote of each member upon each question and shall keep records of
all official actions. Records of the Appeals Board shall be kept and filed in
128 Court Street, Cadiz, Ohio 43907.
   (b)   Powers and Duties. 
      (1)   The Appeals Board shall hear and decide appeals where it is alleged
there is an error in any order, requirement, decision or determination made by
the Floodplain Administrator in the administration or enforcement of these
regulations.
      (2)   Authorize variances in accordance with subsection (d) hereof.
   (c)   Appeals.  
      (1)   Any person affected by any notice and order, or other official
action of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a
hearing on the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall
file, within 30 days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
   (d)   Variances.  Any person believing that the use and development
standards of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an
application for a variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to
authorize, in specific cases, such variances from the standards of these
regulations, not inconsistent with Federal regulations, as will not be contrary
to the public interest where, owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel,
a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations would result in
unnecessary hardship.
      (1)   Application for a variance. 
         A.   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
         B.   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information:  Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (2)   Notice for public hearing.  The Appeals Board shall schedule and
hold a public hearing within thirty (30) days after the receipt of an
application for a variance from the Floodplain Administrator. Prior to the
hearing, a notice of such hearing shall be given in one (1) or more newspapers
of general circulation in the community at least ten (10) days before the date
of the hearing.
      (3)   Public hearing. 
         A.   At such hearing the applicant shall present such statements and
evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such variance
applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of fact on all
evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of
these regulations and the following factors:
            1.   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
            2.    The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion
damage.
            3.    The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents
to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
            4.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.
            5.    The availability of alternative locations for the proposed
use that are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
            6.    The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
            7.    The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.
            8.    The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.
            9.    The safety of access to the property in times of flood for
ordinary and emergency vehicles.
            10.    The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
            11.    The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.
         B.   Variances shall only be issued upon:
            1.    A showing of good and sufficient cause.
            2.    A determination that failure to grant the variance would
result in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the
property. Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
            3.    A determination that the granting of a variance will not
result in increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these
regulations; additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense,
nuisances, fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing
local laws.
            4.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
            5.    A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
         C.   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
      (4)   Other conditions for variances. 
         A.   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if
any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
         B.   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in subsection (d)(3)A.1. to 11.
have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the
technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.
         C.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given
written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance
will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
   (e)   Procedure at Hearings.
      (1)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
      (2)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
      (3)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony
in support of the appeal or variance.
      (4)   The Administrator may present evidence or testimony in opposition
to the appeal or variance.
      (5)   All witnesses shall be subject to cross-examination by the adverse
party or their counsel.
      (6)   Evidence that is not admitted may be proffered and shall become
part of the record for appeal.
      (7)   The Board shall issue subpoenas upon written request for the
attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
      (8)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its
decision. The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and
thereafter issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a
reasonable time after the hearing.
   (f)   Appeal to the Court. Those aggrieved by the decision of the Appeals
Board may appeal such decision to the Harrison Court of Common Pleas, as
provided in Chapter 2506 of the Ohio Revised Code. (Ord. 2009-06.  Passed 3-19-
06.)
1305.06  ENFORCEMENT.
   (a)   Compliance Required. 
      (1)   No structure or land shall hereafter be located, erected,
constructed, reconstructed, repaired, extended, converted, enlarged or altered
without full compliance with the terms of these regulations and all other
