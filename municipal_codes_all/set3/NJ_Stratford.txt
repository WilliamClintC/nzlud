PREFACE 
    The Stratford Borough Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with the 2002 Republication, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of John D. Keenan, Jr., Borough Clerk/Administrator. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 2.12.040 is section .040, located in chapter 2.12 of title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning in 2002, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2018:13, passed December 11, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the borough as accessible as possible to borough officials, borough employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, section 2.04.010 is section .010, in chapter 2.04 of title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, chapter 2.06, Borough Manager, can be added between 2.04, Borough Council, and chapter 2.08, Borough Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note", which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. No. 272 § 1, 1992).) Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables". This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein". 
    Beginning with the 2009 Republication, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)". If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)". Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)", "(Pending)", "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)". 
    Beginning with the 2009 Republication, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning in 2002, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of 2002, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your Code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

    Section 5-16: Soliciting or Accepting Gifts, Loans, Fees, Rewards, Etc.

An isolated instance of financial irresponsibility will not be grounds for disciplinary action except where specific reasons exist to question the propriety or legality of the financial obligation. However, repeated instances of financial difficulty may be cause for disciplinary action. Filing for a voluntary bankruptcy petition shall not, by itself, be cause for disciplinary action. Financial difficulties stemming from unforeseen medical expenses or personal disaster shall not be cause for disciplinary action, provided that a good faith effort to settle all counts is being undertaken. No member or employee shall borrow any money or otherwise become indebted to any other member or employee to the extent that such indebtedness interferes with the efficient operation of the Police Department or the job performance of either member or employee involved in the transaction.

Members and employees shall be required to furnish a Doctor's certificate to substantiate requests for approval of sick leave when such sick leave exceeds five (5) consecutive workdays, or when management has given written notice to an employee that there is good reason to believe that the employee has abused the sick leave privilege and must therefore furnish a Doctor's certificate for each absence from work which is claimed as sick leave. Notwithstanding any of the foregoing provisions of this section, the Chief of Police or his designee may require examination of an employee by the Borough Physician at the expense of the Borough whenever he has reason to believe that an employee is physically or mentally unfit for duty. 
(b)  The members and employees shall be required to have a physical examination by the Borough Physician every two years, at the expense of the Borough. The Borough Physician may make recommendations to the Borough to help improve the employee's general health.

If the employee's Physician agrees with the recommendation(s) of the Borough Physician, the Chief of Police will manage the said recommendation(s) and goals detailed by the Physicians. 
If the employee's Physician does not agree with the Borough's Physician the employee must be seen by a third Physician. The third Physician will be chosen by the employee from a list of three (3) to four (4) Borough supplied Physicians. Whatever the third Physician recommends, the employee must adhere to the said recommendation(s). The Chief of Police will manage the said recommendation(s) and goal(s) detailed by the third Physician. 
The Chief of Police may at times, while managing the recommendation(s) and goal(s), set his own restrictions if the member or employee does not meet the recommendation(s) and goal(s) set by the Physician. If further action is necessary due to noncompliance with the recommendation(s) and goal(s) managed by the Chief of Police, the Governing Body will take the proper disciplinary action against the employee. 
(c)  The purpose of this subsection is to provide all employees with notice of the provisions of the Borough of Stratford Drug Testing Program. 
1.  It is the policy of this department that the critical mission of law enforcement justifies maintenance of a drug-free work environment through the use of a reasonable drug testing program. 
The law enforcement profession has several uniquely compelling interests that justify the use of employee drug testing. The public has a right to expect that those who are sworn to protect them are at all times both physically and mentally prepared to assume these duties. There is sufficient evidence to conclude that the use of controlled substances, and other forms of drug abuse, will seriously impair an employee's physical and mental health, and thus, their job performance. 
Where law enforcement officers participate in illegal drug use and drug activity, the integrity of the law enforcement profession, and public confidence in it are destroyed. This confidence is further eroded by the potential for corruption created by drug use. 
Therefore, in order to ensure the integrity of the department, and to preserve public trust and confidence in a fit and drug-free law enforcement profession, this department shall implement a drug testing program to detect prohibited drug use by all employees of the said department. 
The drug testing policy and procedures are available and on file with the Borough Clerk/Administrator for review. Said Policy and Procedures can and will be updated from time to time by Mayor and Council.

A.  "Quasi-public property." A quasi-public property is a property consisting of more than one hundred thousand (100,000) square feet of nonresidential space on one (1) or more parcels, tax lots or blocks which are generally contiguous and which are operated by one owner or management company and are held out to the public as being operated under one (1) name or facility. For the purposes of this chapter all of the space within the entire complex as herein defined shall be considered a single complex. 
B.  "Index of incidence" of calls for police assistance ("IICPA")." The index of incidence of calls for police assistance shall include the number of calls made and received for police assistance occurring within a given three-month period as reported and verified by the Camden County Emergency Dispatch Center and total manpower required to answer and complete the call. 
    The source of the information for determining the IICPA shall be derived from the data base kept and maintained by the Camden County Emergency Dispatch Center and the police chief of the Borough of Stratford. 
    The IICPA for any given quasi-public property shall be computed by comparing the total hours of police manpower for any calendar year to the number of police manpower hours required to answer and complete the calls by a given quasi-public property. More specifically, the number of hours required to answer and complete the calls by the quasi-public property shall be the numerator of a quotient and the number of hours required for all police calls for assistance by quasi-public property shall be the denominator of the same quotient. By way of example, if the number of quasi-public police hours in the borough is one hundred (100) and the number of quasi-public hours within a given quasi-public property is nine (9) percent then the quotient would be 9/100 and the resulting IICPA would be nine (9) percent or .09. 
C.  "Armed security guard" shall mean a uniformed guard armed with a handgun who is a Stratford Borough police officer, or Stratford Borough special police officer. 
D.  "Unarmed security guard" shall mean a uniformed Stratford Borough special police officer or a uniformed employee of a licensed security officer company or a uniformed employee of the quasi-public property who is not armed with a handgun.

(Ord. No. 2010:06, § , 6-21-2010) 
5.44.030 - Right to cure. 
A.  Any quasi-public property experiencing an IICPA greater than three (3) percent over a three-month period shall be required to take such security measures as may be necessary or advisable in the discretion of the owners or operators of the quasi-public property to reduce the IICPA below three (3) percent during the three-month period subsequent to the finding that the IICPA for the quasi-public property has exceeded three (3) percent. 
B.  In the event a quasi-public property has failed to reduce its IICPA to three (3) percent or below, pursuant to the requirements of subsection 5.44.030.A. above, for the three-month period subsequent to the finding that the IICPA had been exceeded, then security shall be provided as described in section 5.44.040.

The time period these individuals shall be scheduled will be determined by the Borough of Stratford so as to be most advantageous in order to limit the calls for police assistance to patrol the area of the quasi-public property where the calls for police assistance were concentrated in. 
    In the event the IICPA index is three (3) percent or more, the owner and/or operator shall be required to provide three unarmed security guards or two unarmed security guards and one armed security guard. The time period these individuals work will be determined by the Borough of Stratford so as to be most advantageous in order to limit the calls for police assistance to patrol the area of the quasi-public property where the calls for police assistance were concentrated in. 
    The borough, by resolution, may require that armed security guards be provided to patrol the quasi-public property and the armed security guards' shifts shall be scheduled so as to be most advantageous in order to limit the calls for police assistance at the quasi-public property until such time as the IICPA is reduced for a period of three (3) months to a lower level in accordance with this chapter.

To confirm that the top of block elevation conforms to the approved plan, the permittee shall also submit a foundation location plan to the engineer for review. The foundation location plan shall contain the top of block elevation. 
B.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit a permittee from commencing with framing prior to the submission of the foundation location plan to the engineer, but will instead be a matter to be resolved by the contractor prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. However, since the permittee shall demonstrate conformance to the performance standards listed below in subsection 15.06.050 prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy, it is recommended that the foundation location plan be submitted to the engineer as soon after the installation of the foundation walls as possible but not more than five (5) business days following installation. 
(Ord. No. 2007:16, § 2, 8-14-2007) 
15.06.040 - Final survey (as-built plan). 
    A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued until the permittee submits an accurate final survey (as-built plan) to the engineer for approval. The final survey (as-built plan) shall be prepared by a New Jersey Licensed Professional Land Surveyor. The purpose of the final survey (as-built plan) is to ensure that the lot grading is in substantial conformance to the approved plan and that the lot will adequately drain and have no adverse impact on adjoining properties. The final survey (as-built plan) shall be reviewed by the engineer and determined to comply with the above standards. 
(Ord. No. 2007:16, § 2, 8-14-2007) 
15.06.050 - Performance standards. 
A.  All grading shall be done in a manner that will result in a no adverse impact to adjacent properties. Adjacent properties with natural swales and/or wetlands must be evaluated to insure that adequate capacity is available to accept the runoff from the site being developed and graded. Whenever possible, that land shall be graded in one (1) of the following three (3) methods: 
1.  The rear yard shall drain overland to the street through side yard swales on either side of the house, located on the common property lines with adjoining lots, and the front yard shall drain directly to the street; 
2.  The rear yard shall drain and be collected in a system or interior yard inlets and piping designated in accordance with accepted standards, connected to the development's overall stormwater drainage system, and the front yard shall drain directly to the street; or 
3.  The rear yard shall drain overland onto adjoining properties only as permitted by right, i.e., no net increase in rate of runoff or manner of flow or via an acceptable easement. The rear yard shall be graded to drain as required in subsection A., above. The front yard shall drain directly to the street. 
B.  No more than three (3) lots in a row shall be allowed to drain through a swale unless protected by an acceptable easement. The permittee shall confirm to the engineer that any approved easement has been conveyed and recorded and that it is not subject or subordinate to any other interest that could extinguish it or otherwise diminish its effectiveness. 
C.  The minimum slope for swales, lawns and disturbed areas shall be two (2) percent, and for smooth, hard surfaces, i.e., driveways, one (1) percent. 
D.  Slopes shall not be steeper than three (3) horizontal to one (1) vertical. 
E.  No grading shall occur within five (5) feet of a property line unless necessary to direct drainage off or onto the property, and then into acceptable drainage facilities. All drainage directed off the property shall conform to the requirements listed in subsection A., above. 
F.  The maximum grade for driveways shall be ten (10) percent. 
G.  The top of block elevation shall be a minimum of eight (8) inches above the highest adjacent grade and shall be provided on all grading plans. The notion of the finished floor alone is not acceptable. 
H.  Grading within ten (10) feet of the dwelling shall be in accordance with local building codes. 
I.  Retaining walls over three (3) feet in height must be designed and then reviewed and approved by the engineer. 
J.  Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be redistributed so as to provide at least five (5) inches of spread cover to all seeded and planted areas of the development and shall be stabilized by seeding or planting. Topsoil shall be reasonably free of stone and contain no stones larger than two (2) inches in any dimension. In the event that the quantity of topsoil at the site is insufficient to provide five (5) inches of cover for all seeded and planted areas, the permittee shall provide and distribute a sufficient quantity of topsoil to provide such cover. The composition of any borrowed topsoil shall be in accordance with New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) standards and suitable for use in a residential setting. 
K.  Grading necessary to construct an inground swimming pool shall not interrupt the existing and/or approved drainage patterns. Finished deck elevations shall be set above the natural grade occurring on the lot to prevent the water from flowing into the swimming pool. 
L.  The permittee may request a waiver of a particular performance standard upon presentation of a reasonable justification. The engineer shall have the authority to review the request and issue an administrative change, provided it does not violate the intent of the ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2007:16, § 2, 8-14-2007) 
15.06.060 - Performance bond and inspection escrow. 
    Where a performance bond and inspection escrow have already been or will be established, the requirements relating to the posting of the fees may be waived upon written request of the applicant for billing to be applied to the escrow account. In those instances, a separate line item for lot grading shall be included in the performance bond estimate and the inspection escrow deposit shall be calculated per the Municipal Land Use Law (Chapter 291, Laws of N.J. 1975, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq.) The performance bond estimate for lot grading shall be calculated at a rate of one thousand five hundred dollars ($1,500.00) per lot. The bonding for lot grading shall not convert over to any subsequent maintenance bond. 
(Ord. No. 2007:16, § 2, 8-14-2007) 
15.06.070 - Conditions and requirements. 
A.  All conditions and requirements herein shall be consistent with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices. 
B.  Fee shall be as set, as amended from time to time and kept on file. 
C.  All of the requirements for the control of grading and drainage of residential lots shall be required to adhere to the grading check list (attached to Ord. No. 2007:16).

Chapter 15.20 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2007:17, §§ 1, 2, adopted Aug. 14, 2007, amended ch. 15.20 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 15.20, §§ 15.20.010-15.20.130, entitled "flood hazard area regulations", pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Prior code, §§ 63-1-63-12. 

15.20.010 - Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
A.  Statutory authorization. The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the (governing body) of (Borough of Stratford), of New Jersey does ordain as follows. 
B.  Findings of fact. 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of the (Borough of Stratford) are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
C.  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
D.  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2007:17, §§ 1, 2, 8-14-2007) 
15.20.020 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the construction code official interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance. 
    "Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO, AH, or VO zone on a community's digital flood insurance rate map (DFIRM) with a one (1) percent annual or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of one (1) to three (3) feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    "Area of special flood hazard" means the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one (1) percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    "Base flood" means the flood having a one (1) percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
    "Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides. 
    "Breakaway wall" means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing damage to the elevated portion of the building or supporting foundation system. 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials located within the area of special flood hazard. 
    "Elevated building" means a nonbasement building: (i) built in the case of a building in a area of special flood hazard to have the top of the elevated floor elevated above the ground level by means of piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to the flow of the water; and (ii) adequately anchored so as not to impair the structural integrity of the building during a flood, up to the magnitude of the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard "elevated building" also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movement of floodwaters. 
    "Flood or flooding" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:

    "Floodplain management regulations" means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than 0.2 feet. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
(a)  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

(1)  By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(2)  Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood-resistant enclosure, useable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement is not considered a buildings lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so to render the structure in violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements.

    "New construction" means structures for which the start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain regulation adopted by a community and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the municipality. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: (i) built on a single chassis; (ii) four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the longest horizontal projections; (iii) designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and (iv) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel or seasonal use. 
    "Start of construction" for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal Barrier Resources Act (P.L. No. 97-348) includes substantial improvements and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. 
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways, nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings or piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms, nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure.

    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement officer and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
(2)  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter that permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

(xi)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(5)  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection 15.20.040D.(a)(4) above, and the purposes of this chapter, the joint land use board) may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(6)  The code official shall maintain the records of all appeal actions, including technical information, and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration upon request. 
(b)  Conditions for variances. 
(1)  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items (i)-(xi) in subsection 15.20.040D.(a)(4) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
(2)  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(3)  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
(4)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
(5)  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(i)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(ii)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(iii)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in subsection 15.20.040D.(a)(4), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
(6)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

15.20.050 - Provisions for flood hazard reduction. 
A.  General standards. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
(a)  Anchoring. 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure. 
(2)  All manufactured homes shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(b)  Construction materials and methods. 
(1)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage. 
(2)  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed using methods and practices that minimize flood damage. 
(c)  Utilities. 
(1)  All new and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the system; 
(2)  New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharge from the systems into floodwaters; 
(3)  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding; and 
(4)  Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
(d)  Subdivision proposals. 
(1)  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(2)  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(3)  All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood damage; and 
(4)  Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed development which contain at least fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres (whichever is less). 
(e)  Enclosure openings. All new construction and substantial improvements having fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement and which are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria: A minimum of two (2) openings having a total net area of not less than one (1) square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one (1) foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers or other covering or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. 
B.  Specific standards. In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data have been provided as set forth in subsection 15.20.030B., "Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard" or in subsection 15.20.040C.(b), "Use of other base flood data", the following standards are required: 
(a)  Residential construction. 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above base flood elevation; 
(2)  Require within any AO zone on the municipality's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). And, require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
(b)  Nonresidential construction. 
(1)  New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to the level of the base flood elevation; or 
(2)  Require within any AO zone on the municipality's FIRM that all new construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet (at least two (2) feet if no depth number is specified). And, require adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures; or together with the attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, shall: 
(i)  Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
(ii)  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
(iii)  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the applicable provisions of this subsection.

(c)  Manufactured homes. 
(1)  Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with subsection 15.20.050A.(a)(2). 
(2)  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within an area of special flood hazard shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the top of the lowest floor is at or above the base flood elevation. 
C.  Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 15.20.030B., are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
(1)  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and other development unless a technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(2)  If subsection 15.20.050C.(1) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements must comply with section 15.20.050 "Provisions for flood hazard reduction". 
(3)  In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation data has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the cumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than two-tenths (0.2) of a foot at any point.

Chapter 16.28 - SITE PLAN REVIEW 
Sections: 

16.28.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of the site plan review shall be to determine whether the proposed use, building structure, development or addition to any building, use, structure or development conforms to the Revised Statutes of the State of New Jersey, the resolutions of the County of Camden, the zoning ordinance, and all other applicable regulations and to exercise the powers granted to the borough pursuant to the provisions of the Municipal Land Use Law. Site plan review shall encourage adequate provision for traffic and circulation, the provision of recreation and open space when required, the promotion of safety from fire and other dangers, adequate provision for light and air, the promotion of good design, the general purpose of guiding the development of the borough, and to best promote the health, safety, order, convenience and general welfare as well as efficiency and economy in the process of development and the maintenance of established property values. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 701, 1979) 
16.28.020 - Scope and application. 
    Site plan review and approval by resolution of the planning board shall be required as a condition for the issuance of any permit for development, except that subdivision or individual lot application for detached one- or two-dwelling unit buildings shall be exempt from such site plan review and approval. The resolution of the board of adjustment shall substitute for that of the planning board whenever the board of adjustment has jurisdiction over a site plan pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-76. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 702, 1979) 
16.28.030 - Change of use or ownership. 
    With the exception of single, multifamily dwelling units, or any use the zoning officer determines not to need a site plan, any change of use, ownership, proprietorship or occupancy within the Borough of Stratford will void the previously issued certificate of occupancy and require the issuance of a new certificate of occupancy. In addition, there may be a new site plan review even though no new construction is planned with the conversion of the use. This new site plan review shall assure that the existing facilities are adequate to handle any increased demands upon the site imposed by the change of use. Notwithstanding the above, the zoning officer may waive formal site plan review. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 703, 1979; Ord. No. 2004:12, § 01, 5-11-2004;Ord. No. 2010-15, § 01, 10-12-2010) 
16.28.039 - Minor site plans. 
A.  A "minor site plan" is hereby defined as a site plan which consists of minor additions, modifications, renovations or changes in use which do not entail a change in the drainage system, an impact on any county facility or the addition of off-street parking pursuant to the provisions of the zoning ordinance and is in accordance with the definition of minor site plan set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-5. 
B.  In the event that the site plan meets the criteria for a minor plan, the applicant may request at the time of preliminary filing that the plan be processed through the preliminary and final stages concurrently. The planning board or zoning board of adjustment may at their discretion, process the application in one (1) step, with preliminary and final approvals being granted concurrently. However, the planning board or zoning board of adjustment, at its discretion, may grant only preliminary approval at the time of first review, thereby requiring the application to make a separate final site plan submittal.

(Ord. No. 79:16, § 705, 1979) 
16.28.060 - General regulations. 
A.  The applicant is responsible to include all data required to enable the planning board and the agencies affiliated with it to assure that the site plan will be in the best interest of the public health, safety and general welfare of the borough. Failure to supply the information alluded to above shall be sufficient basis for the disapproval of an application for building design and site plan approval. 
B.  Content. Site plan review shall consider, but not be limited to the following: 
1.  Provisions to minimize any adverse effects that the proposed project could have on the human or natural ecology of the area. 
2.  Assurance that the proposed project shall comply with the regulations of the state, county and borough. 
3.  Parking and traffic control including design requirements for curbing, parking areas, driveways, pedestrian walkways, and requirements to further the best interest of the public health, safety and general welfare. 
4.  The protection of the rights of adjoining property owners. 
5.  Provisions for necessary utilities such as water, sewers, gas and electric. 
6.  The stormwater collection and disposal system. 
7.  Noise abatement, odor and rodent control, trash and garbage collection. 
8.  Provisions for soil erosion control. 
C.  Performance bonds. The planning board shall be empowered to require that the applicant furnish a performance bond for any off-site improvements shown on his or her site plan which will effect the public interest for the purpose of guaranteeing the completion of said improvements. An estimate of improvement cost shall be prepared by the borough engineer at the applicants expense in order to determine the amount of the performance guarantee. Said performance guarantee shall have been reviewed and have the approval of the borough solicitor as to both form and amount prior to the issuance of any permits. 
D.  Amending an approved site plan. An application for the amending of an approved site plan maybe made by the applicant following the approval of his or her site plan application by the planning board. Amendments shall be limited to minor changes in the design of the proposed development and shall not include any proposal for a different use of the property as defined in this chapter. Applications for amendments to approved site plans shall adhere to the following procedures: 
1.  Applications shall be made in the form of a letter to the secretary of the planning board identifying the changes requested. The letter shall be accompanied by three (3) copies of a site plan detailing the proposed site design change, together with a fee set forth in Schedule A. 
2.  The secretary shall review the plans in order to insure that they comply with the requirements of this chapter and all appropriate municipal regulations. He or she shall then submit the application for an amendment to the site plan to the planning board for their action. 
3.  The planning board shall either approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the proposed amendment. In the event of a disapproval, the reasons for the disapproval shall be stated during the public meeting at which the action is taken. Disapproval may be based on the planning boards decision that the scope of the proposed change justifies the submission of a new application for building design and site plan approval. 
4.  In the event of approval with conditions, the plan shall not become eligible to receive a building permit from the construction code official until such time as a site plan is submitted which is revised to comply with the conditions imposed by the planning board. 
5.  In the event of: 
a.  An approval; or 
b.  An approval with conditions in which the applicant has submitted a site plan that has been revised to conform to the requirements established by the planning board; the secretary of the planning board shall sign one (1) copy of the approved site plan and transmit it to the construction code official in order that the applicant may apply for a building permit. 
E.  Completion of construction. The construction proposed by a preliminary site plan or final site plan approved by the planning board must be completed within two (2) years from the date upon which site plan approval was granted by the planning board. Failure of the applicant to complete construction within such period shall nullify and void the site plan approval granted for the premises as if no site plan approval had ever been granted for the plans and said applicant will be in violation of this title if any construction or excavation is undertaken or continued after the expiration date of the two-year period from the date of approval. The planning board may upon good cause shown extend the period specified above for a reasonable period of time in order to avoid undue hardship and unfairness. 
F.  The planning board when acting upon applications for preliminary site plan approval shall have the power to grant such exceptions from the requirements for site plan approval as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the provisions for site plan review and approval of an ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter, if the literal enforcement of one (1) or more provisions of the ordinance is impracticable or will exact undue hardship because of peculiar conditions pertaining to the land in question. 
G.  The planning board shall have the power to review and approve or deny conditional uses or site plans simultaneously with review for subdivision approval, without the developer being required to make further application to the planning board, or the planning board being required to hold further hearings. The longest time period for action by the planning board whether it be for subdivision, conditional use or site plan approval, shall apply. Whenever approval of a conditional use is requested by the developer pursuant to this section, notice of the hearing on the plat shall include reference to the request for such conditional use. 
H.  Effect of final approval of a site plan. Effect of final approval of a site plan or major subdivision: 
1.  The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer pursuant to this section, whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two (2) years after the date of final approval. If the developer has followed the standards prescribed for final approval, the planning board may extend such period of protection for extensions of one (1) year but not to exceed three (3) extensions. 
2.  In the case of site plan for one hundred fifty (150) acres or more, the planning board may grant the rights referred to in subsection H.1. of this section for such period of time, longer than two (2) years, as shall be determined by the planning board to be reasonable taking into consideration: (a) the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval; (b) economic conditions;and (c) the comprehensiveness of the development. The developer may apply for thereafter, and the planning board may thereafter grant, an extension of final approval for such additional period of time as shall be determined by the planning board to be reasonable taking into consideration: (a) the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area permissible under final approval; (b) the number of dwelling units and nonresidential floor area remaining to be developed; (c) economic conditions; and (d) the comprehensiveness of the development.

b.  Aspects of residential major developments that are not pre-empted by the "Residential Site Improvement Standards" at N.J.A.C. 5:21. 
2.  This chapter shall also be applicable to all major developments undertaken by the Borough of Stratford. 
D.  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. Development approvals issued for subdivisions and site plans pursuant to the ordinance from which this chapter derives, are to be considered an integral part of development approvals under the subdivision and site plan review process and do not relieve the applicant of the responsibility to secure required permits or approvals for activities regulated by any other applicable code, rule, act or ordinance. In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this chapter shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety and general welfare. This chapter is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any other ordinances, rule or regulation, statute or other provision of law except that, where any provision of this chapter imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, the more restrictive provisions or higher standards shall control.

16.30.030 - General standards. 
A.  Design and performance standards for stormwater management measures. 
1.  Stormwater management measures for major development shall be developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in section 16.30.040. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design. 
2.  The standards in this chapter apply only to new major development and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major development to the extent that alternative design and performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or water quality management plan adopted in accordance with department rules.

For purposes of this subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash and other floating, suspended or settleable solids. For exemptions to this standard see subsection E.3.c. below. 
a.  Design engineers shall use either of the following grates whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surface water body under that grate: 
(1)  The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or 
(2)  A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate has an area of no more than seven (7.0) square inches, or is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest dimension. 
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion (noncurb-opening portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open channels and stormwater basin floors.

c.  This standard does not apply: 
(1)  Where the review agency determines that this standard would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger storm drain inlets that meet these standards; 
(2)  Where flows from the water quality design storm as specified in subsection G.1. of this section are conveyed through any device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable materials that could not pass through one (1) of the following: 
(a)  A rectangular space four and five-eighths (4 5/8 ) inches long and one and one-half (11/2) inches wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting facilities); or 
(b)  A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches. 
(3)  Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified in subsection G.1. of this section; or 
(4)  Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property. 
4.  Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management measure to meet the performance standards in subsections F. and G. of this section, shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a conservation restriction filed with the Camden County Clerk's Office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity. 
5.  Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP manual may be obtained from the address identified in section 16.30.070, or found on the department's website at www.njstormwater.org. 
F.  Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards. 
1.  This subsection contains minimum design and performance standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and groundwater recharge and control stormwater runoff quantity impacts of major development. 
a.  The minimum design and performance standards for erosion control are those established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules. 
b.  The minimum design and performance standards for groundwater recharge are as follows: 
(1)  The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations in section 16.30.050, either: 
(a)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the site and its stormwater management measures maintain one hundred (100) percent of the average annual preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the site; or 
(b)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume from preconstruction to post-construction for the two-year storm is infiltrated. 
(2)  This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projects within the "urban redevelopment area", or to projects subject to subsection F.1.b.(3), below. 
(3)  The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged: 
(a)  Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and commercial developments where solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than "reportable quantities" as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent with department-approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and 
(b)  Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material". "Source material" means any material(s) or machinery, located at an industrial facility that is directly or indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other industrial activities, which could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final products; waste materials; byproducts; industrial machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents and detergents that are related to process, manufacturing or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater. 
(4)  The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or downgradient of the groundwater recharge area. 
c.  In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations in section 16.30.050, complete one (1) of the following: 
(1)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm events; 
(2)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that there is no increase, as compared to the preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events and that the increased volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming full development under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage area; 
(3)  Design stormwater management measures so that the post-construction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and 100-year storm events are fifty (50), seventy-five (75) and eighty (80) percent, respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The percentages apply only to the post-construction stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the site on which the proposed development or project is to be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to post-construction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or 
(4)  In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with subsections F.1.c.(1), (2) and (3) above, shall only be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the point of discharge. 
2.  Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the definition of major development defined in section 16.30.020, shall be submitted to the Camden County Soil Conservation District for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section and any applicable soil conservation district guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally related products. 
G.  Stormwater runoff quality standards. 
1.  Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff by eighty (80) percent of the anticipated load from the developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management measures shall only be required for water quality control if an additional one-fourth-acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) Rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement. The water quality design storm is one and one-quarter (1.25) inches of rainfall in two (2) hours. Water quality calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural and structural stormwater management measures.

2.  For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below, presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP manual may be obtained from the address identified in section 16.30.070, or found on the department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed in section 16.30.070. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be provided to the department at the following address: 
Division of Watershed Management

PO Box 418 
Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418 
3.  If more than one (1) BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required eighty (80) percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction: 
R = A + B - (AXB)/100 
Where: 
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs, and 
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP 
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP

4.  If there is more than one (1) on-site drainage area, the eighty (80) percent TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff from the subareas converge on-site in which case the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted average. 
5.  Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm. In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible, the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the performance standards in subsections 16.30.040F. and 16.30.040G. 
6.  Additional information and examples are contained in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may be obtained from the address identified in section 16.30.070. 
7.  In accordance with the definition of FW1 at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-1.4, stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FW1. 
8.  Special water resource protection areas shall be established along all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the county soil surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area. These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality, aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance, and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as follows: 
a.  The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water resource protection area in accordance with one (1) of the following: 
(1)  A three hundred-foot special water resource protection area shall be provided on each side of the waterway, measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank outwards or from the centerline of the waterway where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural succession is provided. 
(2)  Encroachment within the designated special water resource protection area under subsection G.8.a.(1) above, shall only be allowed where previous development or disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant demonstrates that the functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area will be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water resource protection area be reduced to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or centerline of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be subject to review and approval by the department. 
b.  All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through the special water resource protection area and shall comply with the standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey", established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. 
c.  If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the special water resource protection area cannot comply with the standard for off-site stability in the "Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey", established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance with the requirements of the above standards may be placed within the special water resource protection area, provided that: 
(1)  Stabilization measures shall not be placed within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the Category One waterway; 
(2)  Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this section shall achieve a ninety-five (95) percent TSS post-construction removal rate; 
(3)  Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on the receiving waterway; 
(4)  The encroachment shall only be allowed where the applicant demonstrates that the functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area will be maintained to the maximum extent practicable; 
(5)  A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the appropriate department staff and soil conservation district staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and 
(6)  All encroachments proposed under this section shall be subject to review and approval by the department. 
d.  A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a regional stormwater management planning committee as an element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to subsection 16.30.040G.8., has been approved by the department of environmental protection, then the provisions of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to subsection 16.30.040G.8., shall maintain or enhance the current functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area as defined in subsection G.8.a.(1) above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the special water resource protection area to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection. 
e.  Subsection G.8. does not apply to the construction of one (1) individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the construction begins on or before February 2, 2009. 
(Ord. No. 2006:09, § 4, 5-9-2006) 
16.30.050 - Calculation of stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge. 
A.  Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following: 
1.  The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one (1) of the following methods: 
a.  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds; or 
b.  The rational method for peak flow and the modified rational method for hydrograph computations. 
2.  For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS methodology in subsection A.1.a. above, and the rational and modified rational methods in subsection A.1.b., above. A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five (5) years without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one (1) land cover have existed on the site during the five (5) years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation). 
3.  In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design engineer shall account for all significant land features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates and volumes. 
4.  In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods may be employed. 
5.  If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater management measures. 
B.  Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following:

16.30.060 - Standards for structural stormwater management measures. 
A.  Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as follows: 
1.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to take into account the existing site conditions, including, for example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type, permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone). 
2.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greater than one-third the width of the diameter of the orifice or one-third the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one (1) inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six (6) inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the requirements of subsection 16.30.080B. 
3.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed, constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion-resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions of the residential site improvement standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4 and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement. 
4.  At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin, the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half (21/2) inches in diameter. 
5.  Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at section 16.30.080. 
B.  Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other stormwater management measures may be utilized provided the design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater recharge and water quality design and performance standards established by section 16.30.040 of this chapter. 
C.  Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements of section 16.30.040 of this chapter, provided the pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certified by the department.

U.  Four-way intersections. Four-way intersections connecting a local residential street with another local residential street or with residential collector streets shall be prohibited. 
V.  Half streets. New half or partial streets shall not be permitted. Wherever a proposed subdivision borders an existing undeveloped street, the planning board may require that at least one (1) lane of the other part of the street be constructed if it is found that such a requirement will increase or improve the effect of the traffic circulation system in the area. Full width construction may be required depending on size or development existing or anticipated traffic congestion and/or the general conditions of the area. 
W.  Multiple intersections. Multiple intersections involving a junction of more than two (2) streets shall be prohibited. 
X.  Intersections with arterial streets. To the fullest extent possible, local residential street and residential collector streets snail not intersect with arterial streets less than eight hundred (800) feet apart, measured from the centerline. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 904, 1979) 
16.36.050 - Lots. 
A.  General. The lot size, width, depth, shape, orientation, and the minimum building setback lines shall be appropriate for the location of the subdivision and for the type of development and use contemplated. 
B.  Lot dimensions. Shall conform to the requirements of the zoning ordinance, and lots abutting major and collector streets shall exceed the minimum depth requirements where necessary to increase the safety and privacy thereon. 
C.  Access. Each lot shall front on an approved street. 
D.  Street widening. Where extra width has been dedicated for widening of existing streets, lots shall begin at such extra width line, and all setbacks shall be measured from such line. 
E.  Side lot lines. Insofar as is practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight street, and radial to curved streets. 
F.  Double frontage. Double frontage and reverse frontage lots, should be avoided except where essential to provide separation of residential development from traffic arteries or to overcome specific disadvantages of topography and orientation. A planting screen easement of at least ten (10) feet, shall be provided along the line of lots abutting such a traffic artery or other disadvantageous use. There shall be no right of access across such easement. 
G.  Off-street parking. Where no garage is erected on a lot to be used for the building of housing accommodations, a hard surfaced driveway shall be constructed from the street line to building line in order to provide off-street parking. 
H.  Odd shaped lots. Where there is a question as to the shape and boundary line of lot or lots for their optimum use by future occupant, including such conditions as narrow or unduly elongated lots and other awkward appearing angles or appendages, the planning board may withhold approval of such lot or lots. 
I.  Extra lot depth. Residential lots fronting on arterial streets, lots having reverse frontage on arterial streets and lots backing on streams shall be provided with thirty (30) feet extra depth. 
J.  Lots backing on railroads. Lots backing on a railroad right-of-way shall have additional depth equal to not less than twenty-five (25) percent. In the interest of maintaining the safety and welfare of future residents of the lots backing on a railroad, a protective fence and landscaped buffer screen shall be erected by the subdivider, the type and location of which shall be subject to the approval of the planning board. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 905, 1979) 
16.36.060 - Blocks. 
A.  General. Block length and width or acreage within bounding roads shall be such as to accommodate the size of lot required by this title and to provide for convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. For commercial group housing or industrial use, block size shall be sufficient to meet all area and yard requirements for such use. 
B.  Block lengths. It is recognized that setting minimum and maximum block length standards must be related to sound planning principles and to the varying densities and lot widths specified in the zoning ordinance. To provide for this needed flexibility, the minimum and maximum length of a block shall be governed by the minimum and maximum number of lots specified in each lot width category in the following schedule: 
Schedule of Minimum and Maximum Block Length Standards 
Lot Width Categories Minimum Maximum Recommended Standard 1. 100 feet or less 5 15 10-12 2. 101-120 5 14 10-12 3. 121-160 4 12 8-10 4. 161-200 or more 3 10 6-8  
  
a.  A block shall fit into a specific lot width category when the width of not less than seventy-five (75) percent of the lots measured at the front building setback line fall within a specific ten-foot lot frontage category. 
b.  Block lengths shall fall within the minimum and maximum required standards; however, a developer should take notice of the recommended standard for block lengths. This recommended standard is set forth as an ideal standard for the majority of the blocks in the proposed subdivision. Some deviation from this recommended standard, however, is considered desirable in the interests of variety and good subdivision design. 
C.  Block end planting. In cases where lot and block design results in undesirable sitting down rear property lines from block ends, a landscape screen not less than eight (8) feet in height shall be provided at block ends by the developer. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 906, 1979) 
16.36.070 - Easements. 
A.  General. An easement shall be provided for all natural drainage ways and all utility lines when such utility line or lines does not fail within a dedicated right-of-way. All easements shall be plotted on a preliminary and final plat. A clause shall be inserted in the deed of each lot affected by an easement specifically reserving the easement. 
B.  Minimum easement width. Except as further required by this chapter, easements shall have a minimum width of fifteen (15) feet. 
C.  Pedestrian walkways. Interior pedestrian walkways may be required by the planning board where necessary to assist pedestrian circulation. Such walkways shall have a right-of-way width of not less than fifteen (15) feet and a paved sidewalk not less than four (4) feet in width. A fence, of a height and type to be specified, shall be provided along both sides of the easement.

A = Watershed area in acres 
In setting the value of the runoff coefficient "C" consideration will be given to the physical features of the drainage basin and the best available data on the future density of development of the drainage basin. 
Land Use Description Coefficient Residential Individual dwelling with lot size: 20,000 sq. ft. 0.40 Residential Individual dwelling with lot size: less than 20,000 sq. ft. 0.50 Apartments 0.70 Commercial 0.85 Industrial 0.80 Undeveloped or parks 0.25  
B.  The intensity of the storm shall be based on the following: 
1.  As a minimum, a ten-year storm shall be used at low points with a relief swale, or a 25-year storm where carried in a pipe. 
2.  As a minimum, all box culvert designs shall be based on a 100-year storm. The rainfall-intensity-duration-frequency curve for Philadelphia presented in Technical Paper No. 25, prepared by the U.S. Department of Commerce Weather Bureau, shall be used. A copy of this is included in the standard details portion of the ordinance codified in this title. Time flow curves are also included in that section for use in design. 
3.  Standard concrete or flared-metal end piece headwalls shall be installed on all pipes. 
C.  Pipeline design. Storm sewer pipelines shall be designed by the following method, and shall be based on the Manning equation and shall utilize the following friction factors: 
n = 0.015 concrete pipe 
n = 0.21 corrugated metal pipe 
The minimum allowable pipe size is fifteen (15) inches. Reinforced concrete class III, shall be used in pavement areas and wherever there is vehicular traffic, unless otherwise designated by the township engineer. Where the cover on the pipe will be less than two (2) feet reinforced concrete pipe class IV shall be used. 
This method is based on the assumption that hydraulic gradient will match the inside top of the pipe when system is under maximum hydraulic load. 
1.  For this method, head losses through manholes, inlets, etc., shall be ignored. 
2.  The minimum slope of any pipe shall be such that a minimum velocity of two and one-half (2.5) fps shall be maintained when the pipe is flowing at one-fourth full. 
3.  When the pipe sizes change, the inside tops of the pipes shall be matched. 
4.  Continuous profiles for each reach of pipe shall be plotted, along with the location of the hydraulic gradient and the hydraulic information shall include the pipe size and type, the "n" factor, the slope of the hydraulic gradient, slope of the pipe, the design capacity and the velocity at the design capacity. 
D.  Inlet design. Stormwater inlets shall be equal to New Jersey State Highway Department inlet type B. The maximum collecting capacities of the inlets shall be considered to be: 
1. When installed on streets where the grade is 0.75% 5 cu. ft. per sec. 2. When installed on streets where the grade is 2.00% 4.8 cu. ft. per sec. 3. When installed on streets where the grade is 3.00% 4.6 cu. ft. per sec. 4. When installed on streets where the grade is 4.00% 4.4 cu. ft. per sec. 5. When installed on streets where the grade is 5.00% 4.2 cu. ft. per sec. 6. When installed on streets where the grade is 6.00% 4.0. cu. ft. per sec.  
Sufficient inlets shall be located and constructed so that the length of surface runoff will not contribute a runoff to the inlet exceeding the preceding designated collecting capacities. In no case shall the distance between inlets be greater than four hundred (400) feet. 
The gutter grate of all inlets shall be set not more than two (2) inches, below the gutter grade. The surface of the paving adjacent to the inlets shall be constructed to blend into the lowered gutter grade at the inlet in such a manner that a sudden drop off or dip at the inlet will not be created. At such locations where drainage is entirely dependent on inlets, the collecting capacities of the inlets shall be designed for one-half the preceding considered capacities. 
Where surface water is collected from two (2) directions at one (1) street corner, inlets shall be placed at, or near, the tangent points of both ends of the radius. The use of one (1) inlet in the radius shall not be allowed. Access manholes shall be spaced at four hundred (400) feet intervals (maximum) through rights-of-way and at sewer junctions where there are no catch basins. 
E.  Open channel design. Open ditches or channels will not be permitted when the design capacity requires a fifteen-inch pipe or larger unless approved by the borough engineer. Where permitted, open channel design should be based on the following hydraulic considerations: 
1.  Manning's Equation 
n = .015 - best concrete lined ditch 
n = .025 - best unlined ditch 
n = .03 - .15 fair to poor natural streams and water courses 
Allowable Velocity Excavation Material Velocity Fine sand and firm loam 2.5-3.5 fps Stiff clay and hard pan 3.75-6.0 fps Concrete lined ditch 15 fps  
2.  Ample freeboard not less than one-foot - zero inches should be provided on all channels. 
3.  The channel should be designed to conform, wherever possible, to the adjacent ground conditions. This means that it should not be projecting excessively above the surrounding ground. 
4.  Continuous profiles for each reach of open channel shall be plotted, along with adjacent average ground and the hydraulic information pertinent to each reach within the system. This information shall include the type of channel lining, the "n" factor, the width of the channel bottom, the side slopes, the water depth, the design capacity and the velocity at the design capacity. 
5.  Open channels shall have a maximum side slope of three (3) to one (1) and shall have adequate slope protection as required by the soil erosion and sediment control ordinance. 
F.  Culverts. All culverts shall be limited to a single opening. Multiple pipes will not be permitted. The design of culverts tall be such as to minimize the probability of debris accumulation. 
G.  Detention basin design. Detention ponds will be required in all major developments and site plans unless deemed unnecessary by the township engineer. 
H.  Detention ponds shall be designed to limit the stormwater runoff to a controlled rate of flow equal to or less than the stormwater runoff prior to development. The required storage in the basin should be for a 25-year storm, with the outflow from the basin limited to a ten-year storm. Complete calculations for the basin should be supplied at the time the preliminary plan or final site plan is submitted. These calculations should include runoff prior to development, runoff after development, and complete calculations for design. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 915, 1979) 
16.36.155 - Detention basins. 
    Detention basins in residential subdivisions should be designed in such a manner that they become visual amenities to the project. In order to accomplish this, the plan recommends the following: 
A.  Side slope of any basin are encouraged to be five (5) to one (1) whenever possible and have adequate slope protection. 
B.  Depths from the bottom on any basin to the seasonal high water table (SHWT) are encouraged to be not less than two (2) feet. 
C.  The maximum overall depth of any basin should not exceed six (6) feet from the top of the berm to the bottom of the basin (i.e.: Invert elevation of the outfall structure). 
D.  Any developer proposing to dedicate stormwater basins or other similar facilities to the borough should fund the required maintenance. The borough engineer or staff will provide the borough council with an estimate of the maintenance costs. 
E.  If the homeowners' association is formed, the developer should fund the maintenance of the basin with a capital contribution to a trust fund, the interest of which will be available for the maintenance of the basin. In the event, the homeowners' association ceases to exist or defaults on the maintenance obligation, the trust fund will accrue to the borough which will use the interest of such funds to maintain the basin. 
F.  All basins should be placed on a separate conforming lot. 
G.  All basins should be enclosed with a six-foot high fence.

(Ord. No. 79:16, § 923, 1979) 
16.36.240 - Traffic impact studies. 
    It is recommended that a traffic study be required for all developments within the Borough of Stratford that will generate twenty-five (25) or more p.m. peak hour trips. If a traffic study is required of an applicant, it will be necessary to provide the various data as outlined below. 
    The traffic study should address the various traffic generating characteristics of the proposed use and the interface of traffic from the proposed use and the existing uses in the area to assure that there will not be a degradation in the level of service in the area and so that there will not be any traffic hazards created in the area as a result of the traffic that is generated by the development. The traffic study should address the various concerns noted below using the standards outlined: 
1.  Level of service. In order to maintain an efficient transportation network that allows traffic to flow without unacceptable delays or safety hazards, it is necessary for a developer or applicant to demonstrate that the existing public traffic arteries have adequate capacities to accommodate the traffic that will be generated by a proposed development. Levels of services A through F (LOS) are defined in the most recent Institute of Traffic Engineers Handbook. New developments must assure a level of service D or better. Every attempt should be made to maintain or improve the existing level of service. 
2.  Traffic volumes. It is recommended that existing twenty-four-hour traffic counts for a minimum of three (3) different days (excluding Sundays and holidays) summarized by hour and by direction and peak hour trips by movement be taken on all critical arterials and intersections affected by the proposed development. 
3.  Future background traffic volumes. Future traffic volumes will be achieved by multiplying the peak hour traffic volumes by the NJDOT "Access Permit Annual Background Growth Rate Table". These factored traffic volumes will be surcharged with traffic volumes expected to be generated by impending development. Impending development would include traffic from developments that are expected to be completed in the immediate vicinity. 
4.  Traffic generation. Future traffic expected to be generated by the proposed development will be calculated by utilizing the latest copy of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) Text Trip Generation. The values developed by using the "trip generation method" will be verified by typical counts when requested by the borough to verify the trip generation methodology results. 
5.  Future build traffic volumes. Future background traffic volumes will be surcharged by adding the traffic volumes that are anticipated to be generated by the proposed development to the future background traffic. 
(Ord. No. 2007:13, 7-10-2007) 
16.36.250 - Off-tract contributions. 
    The applicant's traffic consultant will provide a trip distribution that will distribute traffic to the surrounding roadway system. All intersections that have over twenty-five (25) p.m. peak hour trips will be tabulated and listed with the amount of traffic from the proposed development and the total build traffic at that location. The applicant's engineer should provide the percent of the p.m. traffic that will be generated as a result of the ultimate build-out of the property for each intersection approach. If improvements are required as a result of development the need for the proposed improvement will be based on maintaining an acceptable level of service. The applicant's pro-rata share of the intersection improvement will be calculated by using the cost of the improvement multiplied by a factor consisting of the applicant traffic volume for that leg of the intersection alone, divided by the total traffic volume at build out for that leg of the intersection alone. 
(Ord. No. 2007:13, 7-10-2007) 
Chapter 16.40 - DESIGN SPECIFICATIONS 
Sections: 

16.40.010 - General specifications. 
    Unless otherwise specified by the borough, all work shall be performed in accordance with "New Jersey State Highway Department Standard Specifications for Road and Bridge Construction, 1961", as revised. These specifications shall govern the installation and construction of improvements in all sections of subdivisions whose final plats have not received formal borough approval prior to the effective date of this title and to all construction work hereafter performed on previously approved final plats where adherence to the new specifications will not impose unnecessary hardship by reason of prior commencement of such construction, prior commitments of contracts or prior delivery of materials. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 1001, 1979) 
16.40.020 - Pavement subbase and subdrainage. 
    After the roadway site has been cleared, the borough engineer (hereinafter referred to as the inspector) together with the engineering representative of the owner of the subject property, shall inspect the cleared site to identify the natural subsoil material and subsoil drainage conditions by borings and soil analysis. 
    On the basis of the analysis and determination of this professional judgment as to the minimum standards for fully satisfactory results the borough engineer shall specify the requirements for subbase, subdrainage, roadway base and pavement among the alternatives below. Such requirements shall then be incorporated by the owner in the final cross-sections, profiles and utility plans submitted by him or her to the planning board in accordance with chapters 16.24 and 16.28 of this title. The borough engineer shall also submit a written report as to the conformance of the final plans to the requirements he or she has specified. 
A.  If the natural subsoil contains fifteen (15) percent or less of material passing a #200 sieve and has adequate subsurface drainage the owner shall be permitted to construct, directly upon the graded natural subsoil, pavement of a kind hereinafter specified. 
B.  If the natural subsoil contains more than fifteen (15) percent material passing a #200 sieve and has adequate subsurface drainage a subbase of a thickness determined by the engineer, but in no case less than six (6) inches thick, shall be constructed. The subbase shall be of road gravel or similar material containing not more than twelve (12) percent material passing a #200 sieve and shall be constructed in accordance with Division 2, Section 9 of the state specifications. 
C.  If the natural subbase contains more than fifteen (15) percent material passing a #200 sieve and does not have adequate subsurface drainage, underdrains of such size, location and number, together with access facilities as determined by the engineer, shall be constructed in addition to the required subbase. Such underdrains may be constructed longitudinally on the side of the street, and transverse to the street. Where constructed in the center of the street, underdrains shall be located with a minimum of eighteen (18) inches clearance from the sanitary sewer. The trench, in which underdrains specified for roadway subsurface drainage purposes are laid, shall be filled with crushed stone or washed pebbles (from three-eighths-inch to three-fourths-inch in size) for a minimum of six (6) inches below, on both sides and above the pipe, and the balance of the trench, from the top of the stone or washed pebbles to the subbase, shall be filled with approved porous material for a width at least equal to the bottom of the trench, with a two-inch layer of salt hay or untreated paper being placed upon the top of the stone or washed pebbles. Underdrains shall be Type F, constructed in accordance with Division 5, Section l of the state specifications. 
(Ord. No. 79:16, § 1002, 1979) 
16.40.030 - Pavement. 
A.  Materials. 
1.  Bituminous stabilized base course. Materials shall conform to the requirements specified therefor in Section 2A of the Standard Specifications of the New Jersey Highway Department for bituminous stabilized base course. Stone mix, Mix No. 1, except that the minimum bitumen content shall be five (5) percent. 
2.  Surface course. The paving materials shall be FABO Mix No. 5, as specified in the New Jersey State Highway Department Standard Specifications, except the minimum percentage of bitumen shall be six (6) percent. 
B.  Methods of construction. 
1.  Subgrade. Before construction of the pavement, the subgrade shall be in a properly finished, condition conforming to the proper line and grade and free of any soft spots or other deficiencies. Not more than twenty-four (24) hours prior to commencing of operations on any subgrade, the subgrade shall be tested by running a roller of a weight at least equal to that to be used in the paving operation over the entire subgrade area. When permitted by the engineer, testing may be performed by other equipment such as loaded trucks. When in the opinion of the engineer or his or her representative, the deformation of the subgrade under such tests is excessive, the subdivider will be required to stabilize the subgrade in a manner satisfactory to the engineer. The subgrade shall not be prepared during freezing weather or when frozen or when it is unstable. 
2.  Bituminous-Stabilized base course. The method of construction indicated for materials above. The base course shall be laid on a properly prepared subgrade and shall consist of two (2) equal courses unless otherwise approved by the township engineer. Upon completion of base course construction, the contractor shall cut samples from the pavement with a jackhammer, coring machine, or other means suitable to the engineer. The sample shall be intact for the full thickness of the base course and shall be of a size suitable to the engineer. At least one (1) sample shall be cut for every one thousand (1,000) square yards of base course. Where deficiencies in the required minimum thickness are noted; at least two (2) additional cores will be required to determine the extent of such deficiency.

17.05.020 - Affordable housing development fees. 
A.  Short title. This shall be know and may be cited as the development fee ordinance of the Borough of Stratford as amended. 
B.  Purpose. In Holmdel Builder's Ass'n v. Holmdel Township 121 N.J. 550 (1990), the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq. and the State Constitution subject to the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH) developing rules. The purpose of this section is to establish standards for the collection, maintenance and expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's Rules. Fees collected pursuant to this section shall be used for the sole purpose of providing low and moderate income housing. This section shall be interpreted within the framework of COAH's Rules on Development Fees. The section has been amended in accordance with the provisions of P.L. 2008,c.46. 
C.  Residential development fees. 
1.  In accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:94-6.6 (a) and (b) of COAH's "Substantive Rules" and P.L. 2008, c.46, all new development of residential dwelling units within the Borough of Stratford, not exempt from the collection of development fees in accordance with the provisions of this section, shall pay to Stratford Borough one (1) percent of either the equalized assessed value of each housing unit, the coverage amount of the home owner warranty document of a for-sale unit, or the appraised value on the document utilized for construction financing for a rental unit, provided no increased density is permitted. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until this fee is paid. 
2.  In the event that an increase in residential density is permitted pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d (5) (known as a "d" variance), the fee shall increase to six (6) percent of either the equalized assessed value for each additional unit that is realized, the coverage amount on the home owner warranty document for each additional for-sale unit, or the appraised value on the document utilized for construction financing for each additional rental unit. However, if the zoning on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance application, the density for the purposes of calculating the bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance application. 
D.  Nonresidential development fees.

Chapter 17.36 - SED SPECIAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
Sections: 

17.36.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the district known as the special economic development district is to encourage the efficient and economic use and development of a unique area of land situated in the borough. This referenced land is unique with respect to its location, relative to the Lindenwold Terminal of the Southern New Jersey Rapid Transit System, its accessibility to U.S. Route 30 (White Horse Pike) and its present state of undevelopment relative to the land use patterns existent in the remainder of the borough. It is the further purpose of this district to permit flexibility of design and use and to provide design criteria which can be relied upon to produce development of this district which will be: 
A.  A creative approach to the use of land and related physical development. 
B.  An environment of stable character in harmony with and in accentuation of surrounding development. 
C.  A form and variety of development which is consistent with the forecast economic, social and environmental potentials and needs of the borough and the surrounding region. 
D.  An efficient use of land which will result in proportionately lowered public and private costs of serving the development. 
E.  A form of development which lends itself to the creation of an attractive center of physical environment which may provide an aesthetic relief to the otherwise common suburban sprawl which presently characterizes the region. 
F.  An environment which has an inherent potential for improved living conditions and convenience than could otherwise be effected through the establishment and application of other commonly employed zoning techniques.

C.  Meeting rooms, convention halls, exhibition areas and other assembly halls and stadiums situated entirely within an enclosed building. 
D.  Professional and general business offices. 
E.  Automotive establishments providing for the indoor display of new passenger cars and related automotive accessories. The installation of such automotive accessories and the undertaking of minor automotive repairs (not including body work) when conducted entirely within an enclosed building and the sale of gasoline and motor oil in a facility which is detached from a building containing residential uses may be permitted when such are to be provided in accordance with an overall plan for the coordinated development of other permitted uses. Outdoor displays of and storage areas for automotive equipment and accessories are specifically prohibited. 
F.  Motor hotels, motels and hotels. 
G.  Accessory uses and activities which are customarily associated with and necessary to the operation and maintenance of the uses which are otherwise permitted above and which are not otherwise prohibited above.

(Prior code § 105-61) 
17.36.040 - Design requirements. 
    All development projects undertaken in accordance with the terms of this chapter shall comply with the following standards and requirements of design and the schedule of design requirements incorporated within this chapter: 
A.  Floor area ratio and building height. The floor area ratio (FAR) is the number of square feet of gross floor area in the building(s) for each one hundred (100) square feet of lot area. (See the schedule of design requirements.) Buildings more than ten (10) floors above grade shall be planned, designed and constructed in such manner that future additions of floors above the initial construction would be possible and feasible. 
B.  Open space ratio. The open space ratio (OSR) is the number of square feet of open space on the site for each one hundred (100) square feet of gross floor area in the building(s). Open space is that part of the site not covered by the building(s) which is open to the sky from its lowest level, is accessible to all users of the site and has no dimension less than thirty (30) feet. (See the schedule of design requirements.) An unenclosed balcony or terrace projecting not more than six (6) feet into any open space shall not be an obstruction to the open space. 
C.  Floor area bonus for additional open space. For each one hundred (100) square feet by which the open space provided on the site exceeds the requirements of the open space ratio, the maximum permitted floor area ratio may be increased by the factor set forth in the schedule of design requirements. 
D.  Recreation space ratio. The recreation space ratio (RSR) is the number of square feet of recreation space included in the open space on the same lot for each one hundred (100) square feet of gross floor area in the building(s).

E.  Setback. For the purpose of this chapter, "setback" shall be held to mean the horizontal distance measured in a straight line at right angles from the district boundary or a street line of a public street or highway. In no case shall any building(s) be set back less than ten (10) feet per story with a minimum setback of fifty (50) feet. 
F.  Building spacing. Building spacing is the horizontal distance measured in a straight line between the closest points of two (2) buildings. Building spacing within this chapter and within this district shall be not less than one (1) foot for each two (2) feet of height of the taller of the two (2) buildings plus one-half the height of the shorter of the two (2) buildings. If both buildings are of equal height, the required building spacing is equal to the height of either building. In no case, however, shall the building spacing be less than thirty (30) feet. 
G.  Permitted building spacing reductions. The spacing between the walls of the first one (1) or two (2) stories of adjacent buildings, in such a manner as to create a mall or plaza between the two (2) buildings, may be less than thirty (30) feet when computed in accordance with subsection F. of this section as applied to the heights of the facing walls, but in no case less than twenty (20) feet, provided that the building spacing of the towers above the mall or plaza complies with the basic building spacing requirement of subsection F. of this section. 
H.  Special situations for building spacing. No building shall be closer than fifty (50) feet to any lot line within this district unless the owner of the next adjoining lot shall have first filed a legal instrument approved by the borough attorney providing that any area which is not at the time required for building spacing of existing or approved buildings on his or her lot may be used to establish all or part of the building spacing required for the building(s) on the first lot, and further that he waives all future rights to the use of said area to establish required building spacing for buildings which may be established on his lot in the future. 
I.  Courtyards. A courtyard is an area open to the sky from its lowest level and is bounded on three (3) sides by the walls of the building forming the open space on the fourth side. Courtyards bounded in whole or in part on four (4) sides by the walls of the building, commonly known as "shafts" or "shaftways", are prohibited. The width of a courtyard is the horizontal distance between the closest two (2) opposing walls bounding the courtyard and is measured parallel to the outside face of the building. The depth of a courtyard is the horizontal distance from the innermost wall surface to a line connecting the outermost points of the end walls. The minimum width of a courtyard shall be equal to three (3) times the maximum depth of the courtyard.
