result of injury, disease or exposure or the property of a substantial number

elected or appointed to such body of officers, first enters upon the
duties of his office as a member of such body of officers.

§ 11-3. Assumption of duties by emergency interim successors.

of succession. Such Clerk shall keep an up-to-date file of all such data
regarding duly authorized deputies and emergency interim successors, and

officers specified in Subsection A of this section and the appointing
officer or body of officers specified in Subsection B of this section shall,
from time to time, review and, as necessary, promptly revise the

times there are at least three duly authorized deputies or emergency
interim successors, or a combination thereof, for each elective and
appointive officer of the Town.

emergency interim successor unless he is legally qualified to hold the
office of the person to whose powers and duties he is designated to
succeed.

emergency interim successor shall hold that designation at the pleasure
of the designator, and such a designation shall remain effective until
replaced by another by the authorized designator.

may be required to qualify them to perform the powers and duties of the
office to which they may succeed.

ARTICLE I
Procurement for Goods and Services
[Adopted 7-11-2013 by L.L. No. 12-20131]
§ 12-1. Purpose.
The Town Board seeks to exercise the local option set forth in § 103,
Subdivision 1, of the New York General Municipal Law, as amended by
Chapter 608 of the Laws of 2011 and Chapter 2 of the Laws of 2012, which
amendment authorizes the Town to award purchase contracts and contracts
for services subject to competitive bidding under General Municipal Law
§ 103 on the basis of either lowest responsible bidder or "best value," as
defined in § 163 of the New York State Finance Law. The best value option
may be used if it is more cost efficient over time to award the good or
service to other than the lowest responsible bidder due to factors such as
lower cost of maintenance, durability, higher quality and longer product life.
§ 12-2. Award based on low bid or best value.
The Town Board may award purchase contracts and service contracts that
have been procured pursuant to competitive bidding under General
Municipal Law § 103 by either lowest responsible bidder or best value.
§ 12-3. Applicability.
The provisions of this article apply to Town purchase contracts involving an
expenditure of more than $20,000 and Town contracts for services involving
an expenditure of more than $35,000 but exclude purchase contracts
necessary for the completion of a public works contract pursuant to Article
8 of the State Labor Law and excluding any other contract that may in
the future be excluded under state law from the best value option. If
the dollar thresholds of General Municipal Law § 103 are increased or
decreased in the future by the State Legislature, the dollar thresholds set
forth herein shall be deemed simultaneously amended to match the new
General Municipal Law thresholds.
§ 12-4. Standards for best value.
Goods and services procured and awarded on the basis of best value are
those that the Town Board determines will be of the highest quality while
being the most cost efficient. The determination of quality and cost
efficiency shall be based on objectively quantified and clearly described and
documented criteria, which may include, but shall not be limited to, any
or all of the following: cost of maintenance; proximity to the end user if
distance or response time is a significant term; durability; availability of
replacement parts or maintenance contractors; longer product life; product
performance criteria; and quality of craftsmanship.

maintain the organization of the Code.
§ 12-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 12-5
1:37
§ 12-5. Documentation.
Whenever any contract is awarded on the basis of best value instead of
lowest responsible bidder, the basis for determining best value shall be
thoroughly and accurately documented.
§ 12-6. Procurement policy superseded where inconsistent.
Any inconsistent provision of the Town's procurement policy, as adopted
prior to the effective date of this article by resolution of the Town Board,
or as amended thereafter, shall be deemed superseded by the provisions of
this article.

DEFENSE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF OFFICERS AND
EMPLOYEES
§ 14-1. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide legal and financial protection for
those individuals serving the Town of Colonie from losses which may result
from legal actions which may be brought against them in their individual
capacity for actions taken while in the performance of their official duties
and responsibilities. In enacting this chapter, the Town Board finds that the
State of New York has enacted similar provisions for the legal and financial
security of its officers and employees and further finds that such security
is also required for local personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the Town
Board does not intend to limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right
or responsibility of the Town of Colonie or its employees with regard to
indemnification or legal defense. It is solely the intent of this chapter to
provide similar coverage for local employees as is presently provided for
state employees, so as to continue to attract qualified individuals to local
government service.
§ 14-2. Definitions. [Amended 1-26-1995 by L.L. No. 3-1995]
As used herein, the following words shall have the meanings below set
forth:
EMPLOYEE  Any person holding a position by election, appointment or
employment in the service of the Town, but shall not include an independent
contractor. The term "employee" shall include a former employee, his estate
or judicially appointed personal representative.
TOWN  The Town of Colonie.
§ 14-3. Provisions for defense and indemnification by Town.
A. Upon compliance by the employee with the provisions of § 14-8 of this
chapter, the Town shall provide for the defense of the employee in any
civil action or proceeding in any state or federal court arising out of any
alleged act or omission which occurred or is alleged in the complaint to
have occurred while the employee was acting or, in good faith,
purporting to act within the scope of his public employment or duties.
Such defense shall not be provided where such civil action or
proceeding is brought by or on behalf of the Town. The Town shall
indemnify and save harmless its employees in the amount of any
judgment obtained against such employee, or in the amount of any
settlement of a claim, provided that the act or omission from which such
judgment or claim arose occurred while the employee was acting or, in
good faith, purporting to act within the scope of his public employment
or duties; provided further that in the case of a settlement the duty to
indemnify and save harmless shall be conditioned upon the approval of
§ 12-6 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 14-3
1:39
the amount of settlement by the Town Board. [Amended 1-26-1994 by
L.L. No. 3-1995]
(1) The Town shall make a determination of whether the employee was
acting or, in good faith, purporting to act within the scope of his
employment or duties, as soon as practicable after presentation of
suit. Such determination shall be made after a full investigation
into the allegations of the complaint by the Town Attorney's office,
with the assistance of such other individuals as may be reasonably
necessary. If the Town determines that the employee was not acting
within the scope of his employment or duties, the Town shall bear
no legal expense on behalf of such employee, nor shall it indemnify
the employee for any judgment obtained against him; further, if,
after an initial determination that the employee was acting within
the scope of his employment, the Town determines that the
employee has mislead the Town or has otherwise acted in bad faith
during the pendency of the action or proceeding and the Town
determines that the employee was not, in fact, acting or purporting
to act within the scope of his employment or duties, the Town shall
bear no legal expense on behalf of such employee, nor shall it
indemnify the employee for any judgment obtained against him.
(2) In accordance with the provisions of § 50-j, Subdivision 6, of the
General Municipal Law, the Town shall provide for the defense of
any civil action or proceeding brought against a duly appointed
police officer of the Town and shall indemnify and save harmless
such police officer from any judgment of a court of competent
jurisdiction whenever such action, proceeding or judgment is for
punitive or exemplary damages arising out of a negligent act or
other tort of such police officer committed while in the proper
discharge of his duties and within the scope of his employment. The
determination of whether any such police officer properly
discharged his duties within the scope of his employment shall be
made in accordance with the provisions of Subsection A(1) of this
section.
B. Subject to the conditions set forth in this chapter, the employee shall be
represented by the Town Attorney or an attorney employed or retained
by the Town for the defense of the employee. The Town Board shall
employ or retain an attorney for the defense of the employee whenever
the Town does not have a Town Attorney or the Town Board determines,
based upon its investigation and review of the facts and circumstances
of the case, that representation by the Town Attorney would be
inappropriate or a court of competent jurisdiction determines that a
conflict of interest exists and that the employee cannot be represented
by the Town Attorney. Reasonable attorney's fees and litigation
expenses shall be paid by the Town to such attorney employed or
retained from time to time during the pendency of the civil action or
proceeding, subject to certification by the Town Supervisor that the
employee is entitled to representation under the terms and conditions
§ 14-3 COLONIE CODE § 14-3
1:40
§ 14-4. Limitation of applicability.
The benefits of this chapter will inure only to employees as defined herein
and shall not enlarge or diminish the rights of any other party, nor shall
any provision of this chapter be construed to affect, alter or repeal any
provisions of the Workers' Compensation Law.
§ 14-5. Extension of benefits to certain employees limited.
The benefits of this chapter shall be extended to an employee of a
negotiating unit for which an agreement has been negotiated pursuant to
Civil Service Law Article 14 only if such agreement expressly so provides.
§ 14-6. Effect on insurers.
The provisions of this chapter shall not be construed to impair, alter, limit
or modify the rights and obligations of any insurer under any policy of
insurance.
§ 14-7. Construal of provisions.
As otherwise specifically provided in this chapter, the provisions of this
chapter shall not be construed in any way to impair, alter, limit, modify,
abrogate or restrict any immunity available to or conferred upon any unit,
entity, officer or employee of the Town or any right to defense provided for
any governmental officer or employee by, in accordance with or by reason
of any other provision of state or federal statutory or common law.
§ 14-8. Conditions.
Restrictions shall be as follows:
of this chapter. Payment of such fees and expenses shall be made in the
same manner as payment of other claims and expenses of the Town.
Any dispute with respect to representation of multiple employees by
the Town Attorney or by an attorney employed or retained for such
purposes or with respect to the amount of the fees or expenses shall be
resolved by the court.
C. Where the employee delivers process and a request for a defense to the
Town Attorney or the Town Supervisor as required by § 14-8 of this
chapter, the Town Attorney or the Supervisor, as the case may be, shall
take the necessary steps, including the retention of an attorney under
the terms and conditions provided in § 14-3B of this chapter, on behalf
of the employee to avoid entry of a default judgment, pending
resolution of any question relating to the obligation of the Town to
provide a defense.

original or a copy of any summons, complaint, process, notice, demand

or pleading within five days after the employee is served with such
document. [Amended 1-26-1995 by L.L. No. 3-1995]
B. The full cooperation of the employee in the defense of such action or
proceeding and defense of any action or proceeding against the Town
based upon the same act or omission and in the prosecution of any
appeal. Such delivery shall be deemed a request by the employee that
the Town provide for his defense pursuant to this chapter, unless the
employee shall state, in writing, that a defense is not requested.
A. The proper administration of the government of the Town of Colonie
requires its officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid
or unpaid, to be independent, impartial and free from conflicts of
interest in fulfilling their public responsibilities so that the public will
have confidence in the integrity of its Town government. Therefore, the
public interest requires that this Code of Ethics be adopted as a
standard of conduct, in addition to the standards prescribed in Article
18 of the General Municipal Law, for the officials and employees of the
Town of Colonie.

and administration of local government rentals, charges, rates and fees; for
the establishment of petty cash funds; for the establishment of directives

upon which penalties or interest may be imposed for late payment
thereof, shall contain notice of payment terms, penalties and rates of
interest on a periodic rate or annual rate basis in connection therewith.

apprise the payer of such terms.
A. The Town Board may, by resolution, establish petty cash funds for those
Town departments and special districts as may be designated from time

disallowances. If the reimbursement has not been made by the time of
the first payment of salary to such department head or special district
official after the action of the Chief Fiscal Officer, or designee thereof,

special district conducting such review and approval or issuing such
permit, certificate, variance and interpretation.

§ 22-3 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 22-4
1:83
§ 22-5. Investment policy.
C. Application fees may be waived at the discretion of the Town Attorney
and Town Comptroller for good cause only.
A. The objectives of the investment policy of the Town of Colonie are to
minimize risks, to ensure that investments mature when the cash is
required to finance operations, and to ensure a competitive rate of
return.
(1) In accordance with this policy, the Chief Fiscal Officer, or designee
thereof, is hereby authorized to invest all funds, including proceeds
of obligations, and reserve funds in:
(a) Certificates of deposit issued by a bank or trust company
authorized to do business in New York State.
(b) Time deposit accounts in a bank or trust company authorized
to do business in New York State.
(c) General obligations of New York State.
(d) Obligations of the United States Government.
(e) Obligations of agencies of the federal government if principal
and interest are guaranteed by New York State.
(f) General obligations of agencies of New York State if principal
and interest are guaranteed by New York State.
(2) Only reserve funds may be invested in:
(a) Obligations of the Town of Colonie.
B. All other local government officials receiving money in their official
capacity must deposit such funds in negotiable order of withdrawal
accounts.
C. All investments made pursuant to this investment policy shall comply
with the following conditions.
(1) Collateral.
(a) Certificates of deposit shall be fully secured by insurance of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or by general
obligations of New York State or obligations of the United
States or obligations of federal agencies, the principal and
interest of which are guaranteed by the United States, or
general obligations of New York State local governments.
Collateral shall be delivered to a custodial bank. For purposes
of this section, "custodial bank" shall mean a bank with which
the Town of Colonie has entered into a custodial agreement or
a third-party institution of the issuers's choice with which the
Town of Colonie and issuers have entered into a third-party
§ 22-4 COLONIE CODE § 22-5
1:84
custodial agreement. The market value of collateral shall, at all
times, equal or exceed the principal amount of the certificate of
deposit. Collateral shall be monitored no less frequently than
weekly, and "market value" shall mean the bid or closing price
as quoted in the Wall Street Journal or as quoted by another
recognized pricing service.
(b) Securities purchased through a repurchase agreement shall be
valued to market at least weekly.
(c) Collateral shall not be required with respect to the direct
purchase of general obligations of New York State, obligations
of the United States, obligations of federal agencies, the
principal and interest of which are guaranteed by the United
States Government, and general obligations of New York State
local governments, the principal and interest of which are
guaranteed by New York State.
(2) Delivery of securities.
(a) Payment shall be made by or on behalf of the Town of Colonie
for general obligations of New York State, general obligations
of New York State local governments, the principal and
interest of which are guaranteed by New York State, United
States obligations, certificates of deposit and other purchased
securities upon the delivery thereof to the custodial bank or, in
the case of a book-entry transaction, which the purchased
securities are credited to the custodial bank's Federal Reserve
System account. All transactions shall be confirmed in writing.
(b) Repurchase agreements. Every repurchase agreement shall
provide for payment to the seller only upon the seller's delivery
of obligations of the United States to the custodial bank or, in
the case of a book-entry transaction, when the obligations of
the United States are credited to the custodian's Federal
Reserve bank account. The seller shall not be entitled to
substitute securities. Repurchase agreements shall be for
periods of 30 days or less. The custodial bank shall confirm all
transactions in writing to ensure that the Town of Colonie
ownership of the securities is properly reflected on the records
of the custodial bank.
(3) Written contracts.
(a) Written contracts are required for certificates of deposit and
custodial undertakings. With respect to the purchase of
obligations of the United States, general obligations of New
York State or other governmental entities, etc., in which
moneys may be invested, the interest of the Town of Colonie
will be adequately protected by conditioning payment on the
physical delivery of purchased securities to the Town of
Colonie or custodian or, in the case of the book-entry
§ 22-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 22-5
1:85
transactions, on the crediting of purchased securities to the
custodian's Federal Reserve System account. All purchases will
be confirmed in writing to the Town of Colonie.
(b) It is, therefore, the policy of the Town of Colonie to require
written contracts as follows:
[1] Written contracts shall be required for the purchase of all
certificates of deposit.
[2] A written contract shall be required with all custodial
banks.
[3] Written contracts shall be required for all repurchase
agreements. Only credit-worthy banks and primary
reporting dealers shall be qualified to enter into a
repurchase agreement with the Town of Colonie. The
written contract shall provide that only obligations of the
United States may be purchased, and the Town of Colonie
shall make payment upon delivery of the securities or
appropriate book entry of the purchased securities. No
specific repurchase agreement shall be entered into unless
a master repurchase agreement has been executed
between the Town of Colonie and the trading partners.
While the term of the master repurchase agreement may
be for a reasonable length of time, a specific repurchase
agreement shall not exceed 30 days.
(4) Designation of custodial banks. The Town of Colonie has the option
to designate a custodial bank if it is deemed necessary in order to
be in compliance with this investment policy.
(5) Financial strength of institutions.
(a) All trading partners must be credit worthy. Their financial
statements must be reviewed at least annually by the Chief
Fiscal Officer, or designee thereof, to determine satisfactory
financial strength, or the Chief Fiscal Officer, or designee
thereof, may use credit rating agencies to determine credit
worthiness of trading partners. Concentration of investments
in financial institutions should be avoided. The general rule is
not to place more than $100,000 in overnight investment with
any one institution. However, if the institution is fully
collateralized, larger amounts can be committed.
(b) Investments in time deposits and certificates of deposit are to
be made with banks or trust companies. Their annual reports
must be reviewed by the Chief Fiscal Officer, or designee
thereof, to determine satisfactory financial strength.
§ 22-5 COLONIE CODE § 22-5
1:86
(c) When purchasing eligible securities, the seller shall be
required to deliver securities to a designated custodial bank, if
applicable.
(d) Repurchase agreements shall be entered into only with banks
or trust companies or registered and primary reporting dealers
in government securities. Sound credit judgments must be
made with respect to trading partners in repurchase
agreements. It is not assumed that inclusion on a list of the
Federal Reserve is automatically adequate evidence of credit
worthiness.
(e) Repurchase agreements should not be entered into with
undercapitalized trading firms.
(f) A margin of 5% of higher or the market value of purchased
securities in repurchase agreements must be maintained.
(6) Operations audit and reporting.
(a) The Chief Fiscal Officer, or designee thereof, shall authorize
the purchase and sale of all securities and execute contracts
for certificates of deposit on behalf of the Town of Colonie. Oral
directions concerning the purchase or sale of securities shall
be confirmed in writing. The Town of Colonie shall pay for
purchased securities upon the delivery or book entry thereof.
(b) The Town of Colonie will encourage the purchase and sale of
securities and certificates of deposit through a competitive or
negotiated process involving telephone solicitation of at least
three bids for each transaction.
(c) At the time independent auditors conduct the annual audit of
the accounts and financial affairs of the Town of Colonie, the
independent auditors shall audit the investments of the Town
of Colonie for compliance with the provisions of these
investment guidelines.
(d) Within 60 days of the end of each of the first three quarters of
the fiscal year, the Chief Fiscal Officer, or designee thereof,
shall prepare and submit to the Town Board of the Town of
Colonie a quarterly investment report which indicates new
investments, the inventory of existing investments and such
other matters as the Chief Fiscal Officer deems appropriate.
(e) Within 120 days of the end of the fiscal year, the Chief Fiscal
Officer, or designee thereof, shall prepare and submit to the
Town Board an annual investment report, recommendations
for change in these investment guidelines, the results of the
annual independent audit, the investment income record, a list
of total fees, commissions or other charges, if any, paid to

Parks and Green Space
[Adopted 5-25-1995 by L.L. No. 10-1995]
§ 45-1. Intent.
The maintenance of attractive and litter-free parks and green spaces is an
important and desirable goal of the Town of Colonie and its citizens. Since
several volunteers and groups have expressed an interest in assisting in an
effort to reduce and remove litter from Town parks and other public lands,
the Town Board hereby implements this policy to establish an adopt-a-park
program, pursuant to § 277 of the General Municipal Law of the State of
New York.
§ 45-2. Division of responsibilities.
A. The Town of Colonie Conservation Advisory Council (CAC) will work
with the Town Parks and Recreation Department to develop a standard
registration form for volunteers or groups interested in participating in
the adopt-a-park program.
B. After initial approval by the CAC and Parks and Recreation Department,
the registration form is to be forwarded to the Town Board for
authorization of the agreement with the volunteers or group. Such
agreement will include an acknowledgment by the volunteers or group
of the potentially hazardous nature of such activities and delineate the
terms and conditions of participation in the program, including:
(1) That no work of any nature will be performed on the pavement or
shoulders of any traveled way.
(2) The particular activities permitted by the volunteers or groups.
(3) That the group has responsibility for organizing and supervising all
activities.
(4) That the group will organize and conduct a safety briefing each day
that work is done in the adopted area. The Parks and Recreation
Department will provide a representative to conduct the first such
safety briefing, and after that a person from the group will be
designated safety person to review a safety checklist and have all
participants sign the safety signature sheet.
(5) That all participants must attend the safety briefing before
participating in activities at the adopted area, and that all
participants must wear safety gear deemed to be required for
certain activities by the Parks and Recreation Department.

to participate in the Town's adopt-a-park program, the name and title of the
group's leader and the name, address and telephone numbers of the group's
adopt-a-park coordinator.
§ 45-4. Providing and installing signs.
The Parks and Recreation Department in conjunction with the CAC will
provide and install signs, in an appropriate area, identifying those
volunteers or groups adopting a particular park or other public land, if the
volunteers or group so desires, and the Parks and Recreation Department
determines such sign will not create a safety problem or adversely affect
the aesthetics of the park or green space.
§ 45-5. Safety briefings and equipment; liability.
(7) That the group will conduct activities at a minimum of three times
per year, and at a frequency that will meet the goal of maintaining
attractive and litter-free parks.
(8) That each participant (or parent or guardian if the participant is 13
to 18 years old) will sign and date the acknowledgment of statutory
limit on liability described in Subdivision 2 of § 277 of the New York
General Municipal Law.
C. The CAC, in conjunction with the Parks and Recreation Department,
will administer the participants' activities in the adopt-a-park program.
A. Each day that work is done in the adopted area a designated safety
person will organize and conduct a safety briefing, review the safety
checklist and have participants sign the safety signature sheet. The
designated safety person's sole responsibility will be to assure the
safety of the volunteers and the public. The Parks and Recreation
Department will provide a representative to present the safety briefing
for the first meeting, and after that a designated person from the group
will conduct such briefings.
B. All participants must attend the safety briefing before participating in
the field activity, and the briefings should be held on site to ensure all
participants are in attendance.
C. Participants must wear safety gear deemed by the Parks and Recreation
Department to be required for certain activities. These may include
shirts or vests and protective head or eye equipment. The group may
provide its own safety equipment if approved by the Parks and
Recreation Department. All safety equipment provided by the Town
shall be returned by the group's designated safety person on the next
business day.
§ 45-2 COLONIE CODE § 45-5
1:108
§ 45-6. Eligibility for participation.
Any individual or group of volunteers who are interested in assisting in an
effort to maintain attractive and litter-free parks and public lands in the
Town of Colonie are eligible to participate. Participation in the adopt-a-park
program will be generally for two-year periods, unless, in the sole judgment
of either the Parks and Recreation Department or CAC, it is determined
that the participating group is not meeting the terms and conditions agreed
to or is engaging in unsafe activity. In the event of such a determination,
the Town may terminate its agreement with the group and take such other
action as it deems appropriate.
§ 45-7. List of available properties; limitations on services.
The Parks and Recreation Department, in conjunction with the CAC, shall
develop a list of parks and other public lands which are available for
volunteers and groups to adopt. This list may be changed from time to time
and may be amended to add public lands and parks that are proposed by
volunteers or their groups. Such list shall not include any public highways,
streets, roads or thoroughfares under the control or jurisdiction of the Town
of Colonie.
D. As indicated in New York General Municipal Law § 277, Subdivision 2,
neither the Town of Colonie nor its employees shall be held liable for
damages suffered by any persons resulting from actions or activities of
such volunteers or groups, notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions
of law.

In order to prevent blight and the spread thereof, it is hereby declared
that all structures or properties, whether occupied or vacant, shall be
maintained in conformity with the standards set out in this chapter so as
to ensure that none of these structures or properties will adversely affect
their neighborhood or the community. It is found and declared that by
reason of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, structures

initiating slums and the presence of unkempt lawns, overgrowth, brush,
weeds and noxious or poisonous brush and weeds creates the blighting
effect of causing poor drainage, and that if the same are not curtailed and
removed, the aforesaid conditions will grow and spread and will necessitate
in time the expenditure of large sums of public funds to correct and
eliminate the same. By reason of timely regulations, as herein contained,
the growth of slums and blight may be prevented and the neighborhood
and property values thereby maintained the desirability and amenities of

ARTICLE V
Registration of Abandoned/Vacant Real Property
§ 62-51. Intent.
It is the purpose and intent of the Town to establish a process to address
the amount of abandoned/vacant real property located within the Town. It
is the Town's further intent to specifically establish an abandoned/vacant
real property program as a mechanism to protect neighborhoods from
becoming blighted through the lack of adequate maintenance and security
of abandoned/vacant properties. The Town Board finds that the proliferation
of vacant and abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings in the Town
of Colonie can cause a deterioration of communities and areas within the
Town and can have a negative impact on the value of property in close
proximity to the vacant and abandoned buildings, structures and dwellings.
Furthermore, the Town finds that vacant and abandoned buildings,
structures and dwellings can cause a serious threat to the safety and
welfare of the residents of the Town and can erode the quality of life of all
who live and work in the Town. Abandoned and vacant buildings, structures
and dwellings are places of infestation of rodents, vermin, insects, wild
animals and other health-threatening creatures and diseases, provide
shelter to criminals and vagrants who use such places to evade the police
and to conduct illicit activities, and are an attractive nuisance to children
and adults alike.
§ 62-52. Purpose.
The purpose of this article requiring the registration of all vacant and
abandoned buildings, including dwellings as referenced below, and the
payment of registration fees is to assist the Town in protecting the public
health, safety and welfare, to monitor the number of vacant and abandoned
buildings in the Town, to assess the effects of the condition of those
buildings on nearby businesses and the neighborhoods in which they are
located, particularly in light of fire safety hazards and unlawful, temporary
occupancy by transients, including illicit drug users and traffickers, and
to require of the owners and mortgagees of such vacant or abandoned
buildings their registration and the payment of related fees, and to promote
substantial efforts to rehabilitate such vacant buildings. The provisions of
this article are applicable to the owners and mortgagees of such vacant or
abandoned buildings as set forth herein and are in addition to and not in
lieu of any and all other applicable provisions of this chapter, the health and
sanitation code, and any other applicable provisions of the Colonie Town
Code.

§ 90-1. Legislative intent.
The Town of Colonie is blessed with an abundance of natural resources
which help maintain an excellence in the quality of life and standard of
living in the community. Consideration of the environment in the
decisionmaking process through legislation and regulation has been
adopted by government at the federal, state and local levels. In addition,
as a society, we have the moral obligation to carefully consider and balance
the social, economic and cultural development of our community with the
protection and enhancement of our environment and natural, human and
community resources. Towards this goal of enhancement of the quality of
life and preservation of our environment for ourselves and our posterity, the
Town of Colonie recognizes the interrelationship of the many environmental
laws enacted at the federal, state and local levels of government and
designed to protect the quality of our waters, air, soils, ecological systems
and available community resources. It is the intent of this chapter to provide
for such environmental procedures as may be deemed appropriate for
the enhancement and protection of our environment, consistent with such
applicable federal, state and local laws.
§ 90-2. Purpose.
Pursuant to enabling legislation contained in Article 8 of the New York State
Environmental Conservation Law and accompanying regulations found in
6 NYCRR 617.14, towns are authorized to adopt local lists of State

purposes of local SEQRA implementation. Consistent with such statutory
and regulatory authority, the Town of Colonie hereby finds that, in addition
to those Type II actions identified in 6 NYCRR 617.5, which have already
been determined not to have a significant impact on the environment or
otherwise are precluded from environmental review under SEQRA, it is
appropriate to include further actions to the list of Type II actions which
would not, in any case, have a significant adverse impact on the
environment based upon the criteria established for such purposes under 6
NYCRR 617.
§ 90-3. Additional SEQRA Type II actions.
In addition to those Type II actions identified in the SEQRA regulations
contained at 6 NYCRR 617.5, as may be amended from time to time,
the following actions shall also be included, without limitation, as Type II
actions:
A. Subdivision of a parcel of land into three (3) or fewer lots, provided that
no proposed physical alteration of the parcel occurs within any
significant environmental area as defined in Chapter 195 of this Code.13
§ 90-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 90-3

B. Amendment of an existing filed subdivision plan, provided that no
additional residential building lots are created.

Solid Waste Collection
§ 112-5. Legislative declaration.
A clean, wholesome, attractive environment and safe roadways are declared
to be of importance to the health and safety of the inhabitants of the Town
of Colonie. To this end, pursuant to the New York State Municipal Home
Rule Law, Town Law and Environmental Conservation Law, the Town of
Colonie deems it appropriate to regulate the collection of solid waste. The
Town recognizes the importance of identifying the different solid wastes
generated in the Town, where such solid wastes are generated, how they
are transported, where they are disposed of and what percentage thereof
are recycled for reuse. It is in the public interest to create a solid waste
management plan, which plan relies upon accurate information as a basis.
Further, the health, safety and welfare of the public is promoted by
identifying uninspected and uninsured solid waste collection vehicles, their
routes and their methods of operation. Lastly, recycling of discarded solid
waste is a concept to be promoted. Yet, without a method of measurement,
recycling goals and achievements may be under or overstated. This article
seeks to address all of the aforementioned issues while generally promoting
a safe and wholesome environment for all.

ARTICLE III
Recycling
[Added 8-27-1992 by L.L. No. 6-1992]
§ 112-14. Legislative findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Colonie finds that the removal of recyclable
and reusable materials from the waste stream will promote the health,
safety and welfare of persons and property in the Town of Colonie by
minimizing the potential adverse effects of landfilling, by reducing the need
for landfills and conserving the space in existing landfills, such as the
Town of Colonie sanitary landfill; by aiding in the conservation of valuable
resources, materials and energy; and by allowing for more efficient and safe
management of each of the component materials contained within the solid
waste stream. Further, source separation and segregation of recyclable and
reusable materials is an integral component of the Town of Colonie's solid
waste management plan and the New York State Solid Waste Management
Act of 1988.20
§ 112-15. Source separation required.
§ 112-16. Preparation of solid waste for collection.
All solid waste or recyclables shall be prepared for collection or disposal as
delineated in Subsections A through G of this section.
A. Upon the effective date of this article, all solid waste which has been
left for collection or which is delivered by the generator of such waste
to a solid waste management facility shall be separated into recyclable,
reusable or other components (herein after "recyclables").
"Recyclables," for the purposes of this article, shall be defined as any
material accepted at the Town of Colonie material recycling facility.
B. Residents, businesses and all other generators of solid waste shall
separate recyclables from the solid waste stream prior to delivering the
same to a solid waste management facility or prior to pickup of the
same by a solid waste hauler, for example, prior to delivery to the
landfill, before placement at the curb or before disposal in a dumpster.
A. All recyclables such as cans, bottles and other containers shall be clean
of contents with all contaminants, such as lids, caps and tabs, removed.
B. All recyclables, such as newspapers and cardboard, which are
adversely affected by wet weather shall be kept dry to the extent
reasonably possible.
C. Different types of recyclables shall be separated from each other and
from other types of solid waste.
20.Editor's Note: See Art. 27 of the Environmental Conservation Law.
§ 112-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 112-16
1:281
§ 112-17. Collection regulations.
D. Each solid waste generator shall place all solid waste and recyclables in
suitable sanitary containers such as galvanized iron cans and metal
dumpsters, except residents shall place all recyclables in a
standardized recycling container, which container is described in detail
in the regulations promulgated hereunder by the Town Board of the
Town of Colonie. An additional recycling container may be utilized in
conjunction with the standardized container to assist the resident in
maintaining proper separation of the recyclables and to help ensure the
quality of the recyclables.
E. Solid waste or recyclables which do not fit into bags, cans, dumpsters or
similar containers may be left outside such containers only if they will
not attract pests, create a health risk or be a general nuisance for
children. Preparation of such items to be deposited in the Town of
Colonie Sanitary Landfill shall be as described in the rules promulgated
hereunder.
F. Plastic bags may be used for the containment of solid waste if they are
kept safe from animals and similar pests. All plastic bags used for this
purpose shall be translucent so the contents therein are readily
indentifiable.
G. Yard waste, as defined by the regulations promulgated hereunder, shall
be placed in a rigid container appropriately marked with a Town of
Colonie recyclables sticker or shall be placed in a compostable paper
bag. Larger yard waste such as sticks and brush may be bundled as
delineated in the regulations promulgated hereunder. Nothing herein
shall preclude a yard waste generator from composting such wastes in
a fashion protective of public health and so as not to create a nuisance,
including offensive odors.
A. Solid waste or recyclables placed by a waste generator for pickup by a
waste hauler shall remain the property of such generator until accepted
by the waste hauler, at which time ownership of such item(s) shall be
the solid waste hauler's. Solid waste or recyclables placed by a waste
generator for pickup by an authorized third party other than a waste
hauler shall become the property of such authorized third party until
accepted by the waste hauler, at which time ownership of such item(s)
shall be the solid waste hauler's. For purposes of this article, such
authorized third party shall have the same rights and obligations as a
waste generator, including but not limited to proper separation of
recyclables, and may be subjected to all penalties assessable against a
waste generator for failure to comply with this article.
B. No person or entity who is not acting under the authority of the waste
generator or waste hauler shall pick up, remove or cause to be picked
up, collected or removed, any item of solid waste or recyclables placed
for collection. Each such unauthorized collection, pickup or removal
shall constitute a separate violation of this article.
§ 112-16 COLONIE CODE § 112-17
1:282
§ 112-18. Unseparated solid waste.
Any solid waste hauler duly licensed in the Town of Colonie shall be
precluded from collecting solid waste from any solid waste generator who
has clearly failed to source-separate recyclables.
§ 112-19. Promulgation of additional rules.
The Town Board of the Town of Colonie may promulgate, amend and repeal
rules and regulations implementing this article so as to carry out and
enforce the intent and purposes thereof.
§ 112-20. Penalties for offenses; other remedies.
C. Solid waste or recyclables placed by a waste generator for pickup by a
waste hauler shall remain the responsibility of the waste generator if
the waste hauler has refused or is unable because of a violation of this
article to accept said item(s). The waste generator shall remove such
items from the public right-of-way until such violations are rectified.
D. Facilities or structures built for the collection, separation or disposal of
solid waste, recyclable, reusable and other components shall comply
with all applicable federal, state and local laws, rules and regulations.
A. It shall be a violation, punishable as provided in Subsection B of this
section, for any person, firm or corporation to:
(1) Violate or to cause or to assist in the violation of any provision of
this article or any implementing rule or regulation promulgated by
the Town Board of the Town of Colonie.
(2) Collect, except for those authorized to do so, any item of solid
waste or recyclables which has been placed at the roadside or at
any other proper location for collection or within a solid waste
management facility pursuant to this article.

recyclables in or near a recycling container or area designated for
such materials.
B. Any person, firm or corporation committing an offense against this
article or any rule or regulation promulgated thereunder shall be guilty
of a violation and shall be subject to the following penalties:
(1) For a first offense, a mandatory fine not to exceed $500 and a
discretionary suspension or revocation of any license, permit or
privileges granted under this article or any rules or regulations
promulgated thereunder.

discretionary fine not to exceed $1,000.
(3) For a third offense, a mandatory revocation for a minimum of one
year of all licenses, permits or privileges granted under this
chapter, article or any rules or regulations promulgated thereunder
and a discretionary fine not to exceed $2,500.
C. In the event of a continuing offense of any section or provision of this
article or rule or regulation promulgated thereunder, each day such
offense shall continue shall be a separate violation and subject to a
separate penalty.
D. The Town Attorney may maintain an action or proceeding in a court of
competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with this article or any
rule or regulation promulgated hereunder, notwithstanding the
provisions of Subsection B(1), (2) or (3) hereof for a penalty or other
punishment.

§ 120-6. Prohibition against activities contaminating stormwater.
§ 120-7. Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater
pollutants by use of best management practices.
Best management practices: where the SMO has identified illicit discharges
as defined in § 120-2 or activities contaminating stormwater as defined
in § 120-6, the Town may require implementation of best management
practices (BMPs) to control those illicit discharges and activities.
§ 120-8. Suspension of access to MS4.
(3) A person is considered to be in violation of this chapter if the
person connects a line conveying sewage to the municipality's
MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.
A. Activities that are subject to the requirements of this section are those
types of activities that:
(1) Cause or contribute to a violation of the Town's MS4 SPDES permit.
(2) Cause or contribute to the Town being subject to the special
conditions as defined in § 120-2, Definitions, of this chapter.
B. Such activities include improper management of pet waste or any other
activity that causes or contributes to violations of the Town's MS4
SPDES permit authorization.
C. Upon notification to a person that he or she is engaged in activities that
cause or contribute to violations of the Town's MS4 SPDES permit
authorization, that person shall take all reasonable actions to correct
such activities such that he or she no longer causes or contributes to
violations of the Town's MS4 SPDES permit authorization.
A. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at its own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 through
the use of structural and nonstructural BMPs.
B. Any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be,
the source of an illicit discharge as defined in § 120-2 or an activity
contaminating stormwater as defined in § 120-6 may be required to
implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and
nonstructural BMPs to reduce or eliminate the source of pollutant(s) to
the MS4.
C. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid SPDES permit
authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial
activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the
provisions of this section.
§ 120-5 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-8
1:303
§ 120-9. Industrial or construction activity discharges.
Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity SPDES
stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such
permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form
acceptable to the Town prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.
§ 120-10. Access and monitoring of discharges.
A. Illicit discharges in emergency situations. The SMO may, without prior
notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such
suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge
which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the
environment, to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4. The
SMO shall notify the person of such suspension within a reasonable
time thereafter in writing of the reasons for the suspension. If the
violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency,
the SMO may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or
minimize damage to the MS4 or to minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the Town's MS4 in violation of this chapter may have his/
her/its MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,
or potentially exists, in or upon any premises any condition which
constitutes a violation of this chapter.
B. Access to facilities.
(1) The SMO shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject
to regulation under this chapter as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force which require proper identification and
clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make
the necessary arrangements to allow access to the SMO.
(2) Facility operators shall allow the SMO ready access to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination
§ 120-8 COLONIE CODE § 120-10
1:304
§ 120-11. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the Town in person or by telephone or
facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or
by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed
to the Town within three business days of the telephone notice. If the
discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial
establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain
an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent
its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.
and copying of records as may be required to implement this
chapter.
(3) The Town shall have the right to set up on any facility subject to this
chapter such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the SMO to
conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater
discharge.
(4) The Town has the right to require the facilities subject to this
chapter to install monitoring equipment as is reasonably necessary
to determine compliance with this chapter. The facility's sampling
and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe
and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality
shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
(5) Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town access to a facility
subject to this chapter is a violation of this chapter. A person who is
the operator of a facility subject to this chapter commits an offense
if the person denies the Town reasonable access to the facility for
the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by
this chapter.
(6) If the SMO has been refused access to any part of the premises
from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to
demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued
hereunder, then the SMO may seek issuance of a search warrant
from any court of competent jurisdiction.
§ 120-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 120-12
1:305
§ 120-12. Enforcement.
§ 120-13. Appeal of notice of violation.
Any person receiving a notice of violation may appeal the determination of
the SMO to the Town Board within 15 days of its issuance, which shall hear
the appeal within 30 days after the filing of the appeal, and, within five days
A. Notice of violation. When the Town's SMO finds that a person has
violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter,
he/she may order compliance by written notice of violation to the
responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:
(1) The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;
(2) That violating discharges, practices, or operations shall cease and
desist;
(3) The abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or
contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected
property;
(4) The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting;
(5) Payment of a fine; and
(6) The implementation of source control or treatment BMPs. If
abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is
required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such
remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall
further advise that, should the violator fail to remediate or restore
within the established deadline, the work will be done by a
designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense
thereof shall be charged to the violator.
B. Penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided
herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a violation punishable by a fine not exceeding $5,000
or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both for
conviction of a first offense; for conviction of a second offense both of
which were committed within a period of five years, punishable by a
fine not less than $350 nor more than $10,000 or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed six months, or both; and upon conviction for a third
or subsequent offense all of which were committed within a period of
five years, punishable by a fine not less than $700 nor more than
$15,000 or imprisonment for a period not to exceed six months, or both.
However, for the purposes of conferring jurisdiction upon courts and
judicial officers generally, violations of this chapter shall be deemed
misdemeanors and for such purpose only all provisions of law relating
to misdemeanors shall apply to such violations. Each week's continued
violation shall constitute a separate additional violation.

mail a copy of its decision by certified mail to the discharger.
§ 120-14. Corrective measures after appeal.
§ 120-15. Injunctive relief.
It shall be unlawful for any person to violate any provision or fail to comply
with any of the requirements of this chapter. If a person has violated or
continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the SMO may petition for
a preliminary or permanent injunction restraining the person from activities
which would create further violations or compelling the person to perform
abatement or remediation of the violation.
§ 120-16. Alternative remedies.
A. If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set
forth in the notice of violation, or, in the event of an appeal, within five
business days of the decision of the municipal authority upholding the
decision of the SMO, then the SMO shall request the owner's
permission for access to the subject private property to take any and all
measures reasonably necessary to abate the violation and/or restore
the property.
B. If refused access to the subject private property, the SMO may seek a
warrant in a court of competent jurisdiction to be authorized to enter
upon the property to determine whether a violation has occurred. Upon
determination that a violation has occurred, the SMO may seek a court
order to take any and all measures reasonably necessary to abate the
violation and/or restore the property. The cost of implementing and
maintaining such measures shall be the sole responsibility of the
discharger.
A. Where a person has violated a provision of this chapter, he/she may be
eligible for alternative remedies in lieu of a civil penalty, upon
recommendation of the Town Attorney and concurrence of the
Stormwater Management Officer, where:
(1) The violation was unintentional.
(2) The violator has no history of previous violations of this chapter.
(3) Environmental damage was minimal.
(4) The violator acted quickly to remedy violation.
(5) The violator cooperated in investigation and resolution.

1:307
§ 120-17. Violations deemed public nuisance.
In addition to the enforcement processes and penalties provided, any
condition caused or permitted to exist in violation of any of the provisions
of this chapter is a threat to public health, safety, and welfare, and is
declared and deemed a nuisance, and may be summarily abated or restored
at the violator's expense, and/or a civil action to abate, enjoin, or otherwise
compel the cessation of such nuisance may be taken.
§ 120-18. Remedies not exclusive.
The remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies
available under any applicable federal, state or local law and it is within
the discretion of the authorized enforcement agency to seek cumulative
remedies.

§ 155-53 COLONIE CODE § 155-53
1:400
(1) Any person who willfully violates any provision of this chapter or
any final determination or administrative order of the
Superintendent made in accordance with this article shall be guilty
of a Class A misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be
punished by a fine of not less than $500 nor more than $1,000, or
imprisonment not to exceed one year or both. Each offense shall be
a separate and distinct offense and, in the case of a continuing
offense, each day's continuance thereof shall be deemed a separate
and distinct offense.
(2) Any user who knowingly makes any false statements,
representations, or certifications in any application, record, report,
plan or other document filed or required to be maintained pursuant
to this chapter, or wastewater permit, or who falsifies, tampers
with, or knowingly renders inaccurate any monitoring device or
method required under this chapter shall be guilty of a Class A
misdemeanor and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of
not more than $1,000 per violation per day or imprisonment for not
more than one year or both.
(3) No prosecution, under this section, shall be instituted until after
final disposition of a show-cause hearing, if any, has been
instituted.
D. Additional injunctive relief. Whenever a user has violated or continues
to violate the provisions of this chapter or permit or order issued
hereunder, the Superintendent, through counsel, may petition the
Court, in the name of the Town, for the issuance of a preliminary or
permanent injunction or both (as may be appropriate) which restrains
the violation of, or compels the compliance with any order or
determination thereunder by the Superintendent.
E. Summary abatement.
(1) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of this chapter,
whenever the Superintendent finds that any user is causing,
engaging in, or maintaining a condition or activity which, in the
judgment of the Superintendent, presents an imminent danger to
the public health, safety, or welfare, or to the environment, or is
likely to result in severe damage to the POTW or the environment,
and it therefore appears to be prejudicial to the public interest to
allow the condition or activity to go unabated until notice and an
opportunity for a hearing can be provided, the Superintendent may,
without prior hearing, order such user by notice, in writing
wherever practicable or in such other form as practices are
intended to be proscribed, to discontinue, abate, or alleviate such
condition or activity, and thereupon such person shall immediately
discontinue, abate, or alleviate such condition or activity; or where
the giving of notice is impracticable, or in the event of a user's
failure to comply immediately voluntarily with an emergency order,
the Superintendent may take all appropriate action to abate the
§ 155-53 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 155-53
1:401
§ 155-54. Miscellaneous provisions.
violating condition. As promptly as possible thereafter, not to
exceed 15 calendar days, the Superintendent shall provide the user
an opportunity to be heard, in accordance with the provisions of
this article.
(2) If the user is not within the geographic boundaries of the Town, the
right of summary abatement to discontinue, abate, or alleviate
conditions or activities shall be those prescribed in the
intermunicipal agreement.
(3) The Superintendent, acting upon the belief that an emergency
exists, shall be indemnified against any personal liability that may
arise in the performance of his duties to protect the public health,
safety, or welfare, or to preserve the POTW or the environment. The
Town is relieved of all financial liability associated with responding
to an emergency caused by a violation of this chapter and reserves
the right to recoup expenses associated with mitigating the
emergency.
A. Delinquent payments.
(1) If there shall be any payments which are due to the Town, or any
department thereof, pursuant to any article or section of this
chapter, which shall remain due and unpaid, in whole or in part, for
a period of 20 calendar days from the date of billing by the Town,
the same shall constitute a default, and there shall be added to the
entire amount of the original bill a penalty equal to 20% of the
original bill, and interest shall accrue on the unpaid balance at the
rate of 2% per month, retroactive to the date of the original billing.
(2) In the event that there are any sewer taxes, assessments, or other
service charges which shall have been delinquent for a period of at
least 60 calendar days as of December 15 of any year, the
Superintendent and/or the Town Receiver of Taxes shall report the
names of the defaulting persons to the Town Supervisor, the Town
Clerk, the Town Sole Assessor, the Town Receiver of Taxes, and the
Town Comptroller on or before December 15 of the same year. The
Town Sole Assessor is hereby directed to add the entire amount of
the sewer tax, assessment, or other service charge which shall be
in default, plus penalty and interest, as provided for in this chapter,
to the real property taxes due and owing to the Town in the next
succeeding year, and the Town Sole Assessor is directed to collect
the same in the same manner as real property taxes due and owing
to the Town are collected.
(3) Where charges are delinquent and the violator is not a resident of
the Town, or is located outside the geographical boundaries of the
Town, then the Town Attorney is authorized to seek recovery of
charges, including punitive damages, in a court of competent
§ 155-53 COLONIE CODE § 155-54
1:402
jurisdiction or make arrangements with the appropriate county
where the user is located to add the amount of the sewer
assessment or other charges which shall be in default, plus penalty
and interest, as provided for in the chapter, to the real property
taxes due to the County in the next ensuing year.
B. Performance bonds. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a
permit to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this
chapter or any order or previous permit issued hereunder unless such
user first files with it a satisfactory bond, payable to the Town, in a sum
not to exceed a value determined by the Superintendent to be
necessary to achieve consistent compliance.
C. Liability insurance. The Superintendent may decline to reissue a permit
to any user which has failed to comply with the provisions of this
chapter or any order or previous permit issued hereunder, unless the
user first submits proof that it has obtained financial assurances
sufficient to restore or repair damage caused by its discharge.
D. Informant rewards. The Superintendent is authorized to pay up to $500
for information leading to the discovery of noncompliance by a user.
E. Public notification. The Superintendent shall provide public
notification, in the newspaper with the largest circulation in the Town
and/or the official Town newspaper, of users that were in significant
noncompliance of local or federal pretreatment standards or
requirements since the last such notice. The frequency of such notices
shall be at least once per year. The cost of such publications shall be
shared equally amongst the users listed in the public notification.
F. Contractor listings.
(1) Users that have not achieved consistent compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements are not eligible to
receive a contractual award for the sale of goods or services to the
Town.
(2) Existing contracts for the sale of goods or services to the Town held
by a user found to be in significant violation with pretreatment
standards may be terminated at the discretion of the Town Board.

property line shall be constructed prior to the installation of any
taps and curb shutoffs.
(20) The installation of sanitary sewers shall be under the supervision of
the Project Engineer and in accordance with Town of Colonie Pure
Waters Department's rules and regulations in effect at the time of
construction.
(21) Prior to final design approval, the developer shall deposit sufficient
moneys with the Town Comptroller to cover the costs of
installation, testing and engineering review of all sanitary facilities
associated with the street, such escrow deposit to be accompanied
by a properly executed agreement between the Town and the
developer.
(22) In streets and highways beyond a workable distance from existing
sanitary sewers or domestic water, dry sewers and/or water mains
shall be installed by the developer, when directed by the Town,
without expense to the Town, in accordance with the Town's
§ 162-13 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 162-13
1:413
requirements for sewer and water, as set forth in Subsection A(19)
and (20).
(23) The developer shall coordinate the layout of proposed electric
power, gas, telephone, cable television and other utilities not
owned and maintained by the Town with the respective utility
companies and shall provide the EPSD with plans for these services
when they are approved by the utility companies. All such utility
lines, or necessary conduits for street crossings for each utility,
shall be installed prior to placement of subbase material in the
street ROW.
(24) Once the subbase material is in place in the street ROW, no open
excavations or subsurface borings shall be made in the portion of
the ROW to be paved without written permission from the
Superintendent of Highways and the Director of the EPSD, or their
respective designees.
(25) Access to and from any construction site at all times must be
maintained for use by emergency vehicles. Lack of proper
emergency access will be grounds for the stopping of all work on
the site.
(26) The Town may employ at its discretion a construction inspector to
act as its agent for the purpose of assuring satisfactory completion
of improvements, except sanitary sewer, water distribution and
utilities not owned and maintained by the Town, shown on the final
design approval. The inspection provided for shall include, but not
necessarily be limited to, all grading, street improvements,
drainage, stormwater management systems and erosion control
measures, and shall include core sampling of the street upon
completion. Samples shall be taken along the street at its
beginning and end points, and at intervals of not greater than 500
feet or 1/3 the length of the street, whichever distance is less.
Additional samples may be required by the Town. Core sample
holes shall be filled with compacted hot, plant-mixed asphalt
concrete of the same specification as the base course material.
(27) The Town will determine an amount sufficient to defray the costs of
such inspection, based on the hourly rate of its construction
inspector and the EPSD's estimate of the number of hours required
for inspection. The developer shall deposit said amount of moneys
with the Town Comptroller in an escrow account prior to final
design approval. The Town shall be authorized to pay the costs of
inspection by its construction inspector from the moneys on deposit
in said account and shall return to the developer any such moneys,
including interest on balance in the account at the time of
dedication of the street, provided that all inspection costs have
been paid. If the moneys on deposit prove to be insufficient for the
costs of required inspections, the Town shall require that the
§ 162-13 COLONIE CODE § 162-13
1:414
developer deposit additional moneys in an amount sufficient to
cover the costs of such additional inspections as may be required.
(28) Inspections.
(a) The developer shall notify the Town's construction inspector at
least 48 hours in advance of commencement of any work to be
done on the street, grading, drainage, stormwater
management systems, erosion control measures, or other
improvements which the developer has been informed will
require inspection by the construction inspector, and shall not
proceed with such work unless the construction inspector is
present. Any work undertaken without proper notification and
the presence of the Town's construction inspector shall be at
the risk of the developer and shall not be accepted unless it is
clearly shown to the satisfaction of the Highway Department
and the EPSD to be in compliance with approved plans and the
Town Highway and Drainage Standards.
(b) The Town's construction inspector shall immediately notify the
developer, the EPSD and the Highway Department of any
discrepancies observed in the course of inspecting the work. It
shall be the responsibility of the developer to correct any such
deficiencies to the satisfaction of the construction inspector,
the EPSD and the Highway Department.
(c) The Town's construction inspector shall not be responsible for
construction means, methods, techniques, sequences or
procedures, or for safety precautions and programs in
connection with the construction, nor shall he be responsible
for the contractor's failure to carry out the construction in
accord with the approved drawings and specifications.
(29) Upon completion of the base course of pavement, and prior to
dedication of the street, the Town shall determine the number and
type of traffic control signs and devices that are required for the
street and shall advise the developer of its determination. The
developer shall provide all required sign panels and posts to the
Town, and the Town shall lay out and install the signs. The
developer shall have all other required traffic control devices
installed at no expense to the Town.
(30) Upon completion of the construction or installation of facilities, the
applicant shall file a certificate of compliance with the EPSD
stating that to the best of his knowledge the street has been
completed in accordance with the approved drawings,
specifications and addenda thereto and the Highway and Drainage
Standards, insofar as storm sewer, paved areas and grading, or
shall state any defects of which he is aware. No street shall be
accepted for dedication by the Town Board until said certificate of
compliance has been filed with the EPSD.

prior to dedication of the street or the issuance of any building permit,
the applicant shall deposit with the Town a cash payment to cover the
placement of the top course of asphalt concrete. Said payment shall be
nonrefundable and shall be of an amount sufficient to cover the costs of
raising of manholes, valves and catch basins, trueing and/or leveling,
and top course of paving. The amount shall be determined by contract
prices secured by the Town annually through competitive bidding for
such work. The Town shall use these funds to complete or cause to be
completed the necessary work, at such time as the Town deems

ARTICLE I
Senior Citizens Tax Exemption
[Adopted 12-8-1966 by L.L. No. 6-1966; amended in its entirety
12-8-1983 by L.L. No. 22-1983]
§ 171-1. Fifty-percent exemption granted; conditions.
Effective as hereinafter provided, there shall be an exemption from taxation
for general Town purposes to the extent of 50% of the assessed valuation of
real property owned by one or more persons, each of whom is 65 years of
age or over, or real property owned by husband and wife, one of whom is 65
years of age or over, upon the following terms or conditions:
A. No exemption shall be granted pursuant to this section:
(1) If the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of
the property for the income tax year immediately preceding the
date of making application for exemption exceeds: the sum of
$26,000 for an exemption on the 2007 assessment roll; the sum of
$27,000 for an exemption on the 2008 assessment roll; the sum of
$28,000 for an exemption on the 2009 assessment roll; or the sum
of $29,000 for an exemption on the 2010 assessment roll. "Income
tax year" shall mean the twelve-month period for which the owner
or owners filed a federal personal income tax return or, if no such
return is filed, the calendar year. Where title is vested in either the
husband or wife, their combined income may not exceed such sum,
except where the husband or wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife, is
absent from the property as provided in Subparagraph (ii) of
Paragraph (d) of Subdivision 3 of § 467 of the Real Property Tax
Law, then only the income of the spouse or ex-spouse residing on
the property shall be considered and may not exceed such sum.
Such income shall include social security and retirement benefits,
interest, dividends, total gain from the sale or exchange of a capital
asset which may be offset by a loss from the sale or exchange of a
capital asset in the same income tax year, net rental income, salary
or earnings and net income from self-employment, but shall not
include a return of capital, gifts or inheritances or monies earned
through employment in the Federal Foster Grandparent Program.
In computing net rental income and net income from selfemployment,
no depreciation deduction shall be allowed for the
exhaustion or wear and tear of real or personal property held for
the production of income. [Last amended 11-9-2006 by L.L. No.
12-2006]
(2) Unless the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner
or one of the owners of the property for at least 24 consecutive
months prior to the date of making application for exemption;
provided, however, that in the event of the death of either a
husband or wife in whose name title of the property shall have been
vested at the time of death and then becomes vested solely in the
§ 171-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 171-1
1:425
survivor by virtue of devise by or descent from the deceased
husband or wife, the time of ownership of the property by the
deceased husband or wife shall be deemed also a time of ownership
by the survivor, and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for
the purposes of computing such period of 24 consecutive months;
provided, further, that in the event of a transfer by either a husband
or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the property
the time of ownership of the property by the transferor spouse shall
be deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee spouse, and
such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of
computing such period of 24 consecutive months, and provided,
further, that where property of the owner or owners has been
acquired to replace property formerly owned by such owner or
owners and taken by eminent domain or other involuntary
proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership of the former
property shall be combined with the period of ownership of the
property for which application is made for exemption, and such
periods of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for
purposes of this section. Where a residence is sold and replaced
with another within one year and is in the same assessing unit or
municipality, the period of ownership of the replacement residence
and deemed consecutive for exemption from taxation by each such
assessing unit or municipality. Notwithstanding any other provision
of law, where a residence is sold and replaced with another within
one year and both residences are within the state, the period
of ownership of both properties shall be deemed consecutive for
purposes of the exemption from taxation by a municipality within
the state granting such exemption.
(3) Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes.
(4) Unless the real property is the legal residence of and is occupied, in
whole or in part, by the owner or by all of the owners of the
property.
B. The Town of Colonie shall notify, or cause to be notified, each person
owning residential real property in said Town of the provisions of this
section. The provisions of this subsection may be met by a notice or
legend sent on or with each tax bill to such persons reading "You may be
eligible for senior citizen tax exemptions. Senior citizens have until
month ..... day .... year .... to apply for such exemptions. For information
please call or write .....," followed by the name, telephone number and/
or address of a person or department of the Town of Colonie. Failure to
notify or cause to be notified any person who is, in fact, eligible to
receive the exemption provided by this section or the failure of such
person to receive the same shall not prevent the levy, collection and
enforcement of the payment of the taxes on property owned by such
person.
C. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property on forms prescribed by the State Board to be
§ 171-1 COLONIE CODE § 171-1
1:426
furnished by the Town of Colonie, and shall furnish the information
and be executed in the manner required or prescribed in such forms
and shall be filed in such Assessor's office on or before the appropriate
taxable status date. Notwithstanding any other provision of law, any
person otherwise qualifying under this section shall not be denied the
exemption under this section if he becomes 65 years of age after the
appropriate taxable status date and before December 31 of the same
year. [Amended 11-16-1989 by L.L. No. 12-1989]
D. At least 60 days prior to the appropriate taxable status date, the Town
of Colonie shall mail to each person who was granted exemption
pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll an
application form and a notice that such application must be filed on or
before taxable status date and be approved in order for the exemption
to be granted. The Town of Colonie shall, within three days of the
completion and filing of the tentative assessment roll, notify by mail any
applicant who has included with his application at least one selfaddressed,
prepaid envelope, of the approval or denial of the
application; provided, however, that the Town of Colonie shall, upon the
receipt and filing of the application, send by mail notification of receipt
to any applicant who has included two of such envelopes with the
application. Where an applicant is entitled to a notice of denial
pursuant to this subsection, such notice shall be on a form prescribed
by the State Board and shall state the reasons for such denial and shall
further state that the applicant may have such determination reviewed
in the manner provided by law. Failure to mail any such application
form or notices or the failure of such person to receive any of the same
shall not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of
the taxes on property owned by such person.
E. Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the
application for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not more
than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants from further
exemption for a period of five years.
F. The real property tax exemption on real property owned by a husband
and wife, one of whom is 65 years of age or over, once granted, shall not
be rescinded by the Town of Colonie solely because of the death of the
older spouse so long as the surviving spouse is at least 62 years of age.
G. The Town of Colonie shall accept applications for renewal of
exemptions pursuant to this section after the taxable status date. In the

A. No exemption shall be granted pursuant to this section:
(1) If the income of the owner or the combined income of the owners of
the property for the income tax year immediately preceding the
date of making application for exemption exceeds: the sum of
$33,399.99 for an exemption on the 2007 assessment roll; the sum
of $34,399.99 for an exemption on the 2008 assessment roll; the
sum of $35,399.99 for an exemption on the 2009 assessment roll;
and the sum of $36,399.99 for an exemption on the 2010
assessment roll. "Income tax year" shall mean the twelve-month
period for which the owner or owners filed a federal personal
income tax return or, if no such return is filed, the calendar year.
Where title is vested in either the husband or wife, their combined
income may not exceed such sum, except where the husband or
wife, or ex-husband or ex-wife, is absent from the property as
§ 171-1.1 COLONIE CODE § 171-1.1
1:430
provided in Subparagraph (ii) of Paragraph (d) of Subdivision 3 of
§ 467 of the Real Property Tax Law, then only the income of the
spouse or ex-spouse residing on the property shall be considered
and may not exceed such sum. Such income shall include social
security and retirement benefits, interest, dividends, total gain
from the sale or exchange of a capital asset which may be offset
by a loss from the sale or exchange of a capital asset in the same
income tax year, net rental income, salary or earnings and net
income from self-employment, but shall not include a return of
capital, gifts or inheritances or monies earned through employment
in the Federal Foster Grandparent Program, or medical and
prescription drug expenses actually paid which were not
reimbursed or paid for by insurance. In computing net rental
income and net income from self-employment, no depreciation
deduction shall be allowed for the exhaustion or wear and tear of
real or personal property held for the production of income.
(2) Unless the title of the property shall have been vested in the owner
or one of the owners of the property for at least 24 consecutive
months prior to the date of making application for exemption;
provided, however, that in the event of the death of either a
husband or wife in whose name title of the property shall have been
vested at the time of death and then becomes vested solely in the
survivor by virtue of devise by or decent from the deceased
husband or wife, the time of ownership of the property by the
deceased husband or wife shall be deemed also a time of ownership
by the survivor, and such ownership shall be deemed continuous for
the purposes of computing such period of 24 consecutive months,
provided, further, that in the event of a transfer by either a husband
or wife to the other spouse of all or part of the title to the property,
the time of ownership of the property by the transferor spouse shall
be deemed also a time of ownership by the transferee spouse, and
such ownership shall be deemed continuous for the purposes of
computing such period of 24 consecutive months, and provided,
further, that where property of the owner or owners has been
acquired to replace property formerly owned by such owner or
owners and taken by eminent domain or other involuntary
proceeding, except a tax sale, the period of ownership of the former
property shall be combined with the period of ownership of the
property for which application is made for exemption, and such
periods of ownership shall be deemed to be consecutive for
purposes of this section. Where a residence is sold and replaced
with another within one year and is in the same assessing unit or
municipality, the period of ownership of the former property shall
be combined with the period of ownership of the replacement
residence and deemed consecutive for exemption from taxation by
each such assessing unit or municipality. Notwithstanding any
other provision of law, where a residence is sold and replaced with
another within one year and both residences are within the state,
the period of ownership of both properties shall be deemed
§ 171-1.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 171-1.1
1:431
consecutive for purposes of the exemption from taxation by a
municipality within the state granting such exemption.
(3) Unless the property is used exclusively for residential purposes.
(4) Unless the real property is the legal residence and is occupied, in
whole or in part, by the owner or by all of the owners of the
property.
B. Application for such exemption must be made by the owner or all of the
owners of the property on forms prescribed by the State Board to be
furnished by the Town of Colonie and shall furnish the information and
be executed in the manner required or prescribed in such forms and
shall be filed in the Town of Colonie Assessor's office on or before the
appropriate taxable status date. Notwithstanding any other provision of
law, any person otherwise qualifying under this section shall not be
denied the exemption under this section if he becomes 65 years of age
after the appropriate taxable status date and before December 31 of the
same year.
C. At least 60 days prior to the appropriate taxable status date, the Town
of Colonie shall mail to each person who was granted exemption
pursuant to this section on the latest completed assessment roll an
application form and a notice that such application must be filed on or
before taxable status date and be approved in order for the exemption
to be granted. The Town of Colonie shall, within three days of the
completion and filing of the tentative assessment roll, notify by mail any
applicant who has included with his application at least one selfaddressed,
prepaid envelope, of the approval or denial of the
application; provided, however, that the Town of Colonie shall, upon the
receipt and filing of the application, send by mail notification of receipt
to any applicant who has included two of such envelopes with the
application. Where an application is entitled to a notice of denial
pursuant to this subdivision, such notice shall be on a form prescribed
by the State Board and shall state the reasons for such denial and shall
further state that the applicant may have such determination reviewed
in the manner provided by law. Failure to mail any such application
form or notices or the failure of such person to receive any of the same
shall not prevent the levy, collection and enforcement of the payment of
the taxes on property owned by such person.
D. Penalty for false statement; collection of erroneous exemption; payment
of fines.
(1) Any conviction of having made any willful false statement in the
application for such exemption shall be punishable by a fine of not
more than $100 and shall disqualify the applicant or applicants
from further exemption for a period of five years.
(2) Notwithstanding any inconsistent provisions of the New York State
Real Property Tax law, the collection of any amount of tax
erroneously exempted due to an incorrect statement in an
§ 171-1.1 COLONIE CODE § 171-1.1
1:432
application for exemption shall be enforceable in the same manner
provided for the collection of delinquent taxes pursuant to the
provisions of Article 10 of the New York State Real Property Tax
Law.32
(3) Any fine levied pursuant to Subsection D(1) of this subsection shall
be paid to the appropriate assessing authority.
E. The real property tax exemption on real property owned by husband
and wife, one of whom is 65 years of age or over, once granted, shall not
be rescinded by the Town of Colonie solely because of the death of the
older spouse so long as the surviving spouse is at least 62 years of age.
F. The Town of Colonie shall accept applications for renewal of
exemptions pursuant to this section after the taxable status date. In the
event that the owner or all of the owners of property which has received
an exemption pursuant to this section on the preceding assessment roll
fail to file the application required pursuant to this section on or before
the taxable status date, such owner or owners may file the application,
executed as if such application had been filed on or before the taxable
status date, with the Assessor on or before the date for the hearing of
complaints.

No. 10-1997]
§ 171-3. Grant of exemption; conditions.
A. Effective as hereinafter provided, there shall be an exemption from
taxation for general Town purposes to the extent of the value of an
improvement to any real property used solely for residential purposes
as a one- , two- or three-family residence, provided that such
improvement is used for the purpose of facilitating and accommodating
the use and accessibility of such real property by a resident owner of
the real property who is physically disabled or a member of the resident
owner's household who is physically disabled, if such member resides in
the real property. This exemption shall also apply to such improvements
constructed prior to the date of this article.
B. To qualify as physically disabled for the purposes of this section, an
individual shall submit to the Assessor a certified statement from a
physician licensed to practice in New York State on a form prescribed
and made available by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment,
which states that the individual has a permanent physical impairment
which substantially limits one or more of such individual's major life
activities, except that an individual who has obtained a certificate from
the State Commission for the Blind and Visually Handicapped stating
that such individual is legally blind may submit such certificate in lieu of
a physician's certified statement.
C. Such exemption shall be granted only upon application by the owner or
all of the owners of the real property on a form prescribed and made
available by the State Board of Equalization and Assessment. The
applicant shall furnish such information as the Board shall require. The
application shall be filed, together with the appropriate certified
statement of physical disability or certificate of blindness, with the
Assessor on or before the taxable status date of the Town.
D. If the Assessor is satisfied that the improvement is necessary to
facilitate and accommodate the use and accessibility by a resident who
is physically disabled and that the applicant is entitled to an exemption
pursuant to this section, the Assessor shall approve the application and
enter the taxable assessed value of the parcel for which an exemption
has been granted pursuant to this section on the assessment roll with
taxable property, with the amount of the exemption as determined
pursuant to Subsection A of this section in a separate column. Once
granted, the exemption shall continue on the real property until the
improvement ceases to be necessary to facilitate and accommodate the
use and accessibility of the property by the resident who is physically
disabled.

Eligible Funds Veterans Exemption
[Adopted 9-22-1994 by L.L. No. 10-1994]
§ 171-7. Legislative intent.
The purpose of this article is to authorize a change in the amount of the
eligible funds exemption granted to veterans in the event of a material
change in the level of assessment as authorized by Subdivision 5 of § 458 of
the Real Property Tax Law.
§ 171-7.1. Grant conditions.
A. In the event that the total assessed value of any real property for which
an exemption prescribed in Subdivision 1 or 2 of § 458 of the New York
State Real Property Tax Law has been granted increases or decreases
as the result of a revaluation or update of assessments, and a material
change in level of assessment, as provided in Title 2 of Article 12 of the
Real Property Tax Law, is certified for the assessment roll pursuant to
the rules of the State Board of Equalization and Assessment, the sole
Assessor of the Town of Colonie shall increase or decrease the amount
of such exemption by multiplying the amount of such exemption by such
change in level of assessment. If the Assessor receives the certification
after the completion, verification and filing of the final assessment roll,
the Assessor shall certify the amount of exemption as recomputed
pursuant to this subsection to the local officers having custody and
control of the roll, and such local officers are hereby directed and
authorized to enter the recomputed exemption certified by the Assessor
on the roll.
B. Owners of real property who previously received an exemption
pursuant to § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law, but who opted instead
to receive an exemption pursuant to § 458-a of the Real Property Tax
Law, may again receive an exemption pursuant to § 458 of the Real
Property Tax Law upon application by the owner within one year of the
adoption of this article. The Assessor shall recompute all exemptions
granted pursuant to this section by multiplying the amount of each such
exemption by the cumulative change in level of assessment certified by
the State Board of Equalization and Assessment measured from the
assessment roll immediately preceding the assessment roll on which
exemptions were first granted pursuant to § 458-a of the Real Property
Tax Law; provided, however, that if an exemption pursuant to this
section was initially granted to a parcel on a later assessment roll, the
cumulative change in level factor to be used in recomputing that
exemption shall be measured from the assessment roll immediately
preceding the assessment roll on which that exemption was initially
granted. No refunds or retroactive entitlements shall be granted.
C. In the event that a veteran who has received an exemption under this
article shall become entitled to any additional eligible funds, such
§ 171-7 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 171-7.1
1:447
§ 171-7.2. Purchase of new property within Town of Colonie. [Added
10-21-2010 by L.L. No. 9-2010]
Where a veteran already receiving an exemption pursuant to this article
sells the property receiving the exemption and purchases another property
that is also within the Town of Colonie, the Town Assessor shall transfer
and prorate the exemption for the remainder of the fiscal year as set forth
in Real Property Tax Law § 458(9). The prorated exemption shall be based
upon the date the veteran obtains title to the new property. A veteran who
wishes to receive the exemption in future fiscal years is still required to
reapply for the exemption pursuant to this section on or before the following
taxable status date.
veteran shall be granted a recompute exemption in lieu of the
exemption otherwise authorized by § 458 of the Real Property Tax Law.
Such recompute exemption may be granted on any assessment roll
filed in or after calendar year 2006. For purposes of this subsection,
a "recompute exemption" means the sum of the original exemption
and any additional eligible funds received multiplied by the change in
level of assessment from the assessment roll in the year the exemption
was originally granted. [Amended 2-26-1998 by L.L. No. 1-1998;

or in part, by the disabled person, except where the disabled person is
absent from the residence while receiving health-related care as an
inpatient of a residential health-care facility, as defined in § 2801 of the

that it exceeds the amount paid by such person or spouse or sibling of
such person for care in the facility.

TELECOMMUNICATIONS FRANCHISING AND USE OF TOWN
RIGHTS-OF-WAY

Department of Public Works  See Ch. 34.
Streets and sidewalks  See Ch. 162.
Zoning  See Ch. 190.
§ 173-1. Legislative intent; findings.
A. The Town of Colonie (the Town) has the authority to grant franchises
and/or licenses for the use and occupancy of the Town rights-of-way.
The Town has determined that the rights-of-way are a valuable public
resource that have required and will continue to require prudent
management by the Town.
B. The Town of Colonie finds that the enactment of a telecommunications
law will have a beneficial impact on all of the citizens of the Town.
Competition among telecommunications providers is increasing due to
advancements in technology, changes in federal and state law and
increased demand for such services from Town residents, businesses,
educational institutions, governmental offices and other public and
private institutions. Many of these telecommunications providers must
utilize public rights-of-way in order to operate. The Town further finds
that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be
served by establishing regulatory powers and procedures to protect
public rights-of-way, and to ensure the orderly development of a
telecommunications infrastructure which effectively serves the Town,
while at the same time not erecting barriers which prohibit or
effectively prohibit competition among telecommunications providers
operating within the Town.
C. The Town desires to structure and implement a fair and orderly process
for the granting of franchises and/or licenses, (and renewals of such
franchises and/or licenses) to occupy and use the Town rights-of-way to
provide telecommunications services in the Town, including the
negotiation of terms and conditions to protect the interest of the public
in the safety and integrity of the public rights-of-way and in obtaining
fair and reasonable compensation for the use of the public rights-of-way
consistent with applicable law. Consistent with applicable law, the Town
desires to manage the rights-of-way and obtain fair and reasonable
compensation from telecommunications providers on a competitively
neutral and nondiscriminatory basis for the use of the rights-of-way. The
Town further finds that such regulatory powers should be vested in the
§ 171-11.2 COLONIE CODE § 173-1
1:462
§ 173-2. Definitions and word usage.
Town or such persons as the Town shall designate. [Amended
5-27-2004 by L.L. No. 7-2004]
D. The Town desires to minimize inconvenience and disruption to the
public, provide for the orderly and efficient use of the rights-of-way now
and in the future and preserve adequate capacity for existing and future
uses of its rights-of-way. The Town intends to exercise, to the fullest
extent permitted by applicable law, its authority with respect to the
regulation of the occupation and use of its rights-of-way in connection
with the provision of telecommunications services.
E. The Town Board has determined that the procedures set forth by this
chapter for granting franchises and/or licenses for the installation,
construction, operation and maintenance of telecommunications
systems in the Town promote the public interest, enhance the public
health, safety and welfare and stimulate commerce by assuring that:
(1) Telecommunications systems are responsive to the needs and
interests of the Town and its residents;
(2) Telecommunications systems provide, and are encouraged to
provide, the widest diversity of information and service to the
public; and
(3) There is an orderly process for granting or renewal of franchises
and/or licenses and for oversight of the services provided pursuant
to franchises, licenses and other authorizations.

joint venture or joint venture partner of the applicant; and each person,
directly or indirectly, controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with, the applicant; provided that such affiliated person shall
in no event mean the Town, or any creditor of the applicant solely by
virtue of its status as a creditor and which is not otherwise an affiliated
person by reason of owning a controlling interest in, being owned by,
or being under common ownership, common management or common
control with, the applicant.
APPLICANT  Any person who applies for a franchise and/or license

licensee. The Town shall provide the franchisee or licensee with
written notification requesting such relocation. The franchisee or

effect such removal or relocation, and the expense thereof shall be
paid by the franchisee or licensee, including all costs and expenses
incurred by the Town due to the franchisee's or licensee's delay. If

supervision of the Town.
§ 173-11 COLONIE CODE § 173-11
1:476
(11) Reservation of rights. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to
prevent the Town from constructing sewers, grading, paving,
repairing and/or altering any street or rights-of-way or the laying
down, repairing or removing sewer and/or water mains or
constructing or establishing any other public work or improvement.
All such work shall be done, in so far as practicable, so as not to
injure or prevent the unrestricted use and operation of the
telecommunications system of the franchisee or licensee under this
chapter. However, if any of the franchisee's or licensee's
telecommunications system interferes with the construction or
repair of any rights-of-way or public improvement, including
construction, repair or removal of a sewer and/or water main and
any other public work or improvement, the franchisee's or
licensee's network shall be removed or replaced in the manner the
Town shall direct. However, the Town will cooperate with the
franchisee or licensee to identify possible alternate locations within
the rights-of-way. The franchisee or licensee shall have no vested
right in any location. Any and all such removal or replacement shall
be at the expense of the franchisee or licensee. Should the
franchisee or licensee fail to remove, adjust or relocate its facilities
by the date established by the DPW's written notice to the
franchisee or licensee, the Town may cause and/or effect such
removal, adjustment or relocation, and the expense thereof shall be
paid by the franchisee or licensee, including all costs and expenses
incurred by the Town due to franchisee's or licensee's delay.
(12) Public rights-of-way vacation.
(a) If any public rights-of-way or portion thereof used by the
franchisee or licensee is vacated by the Town during the term
of the franchise agreement or license, and unless the Town
Board specifically reserves to the franchisee or licensee the
right to continue its installation in the vacated rights-of-way
area, the franchisee or licensee shall, without expense to the
Town, forthwith remove its telecommunications system from
such rights-of-way and restore, repair or reconstruct the
rights-of-way area, where such removal has occurred, and
place the rights-of-way area in such condition as may be
required by the DPW which shall be no worse than the
condition of such rights-of-way immediately prior to removal.
(b) In the event of the failure, neglect or refusal of the franchisee
or licensee, after 30 days' notice by the DPW, to repair, improve
or maintain such rights-of-way portions, the Town may do such
work, or cause it to be done, and the direct cost thereof shall
be charged to the franchisee or licensee.
(c) The franchisee or licensee shall have no vested right in any
location. The Town will cooperate with the franchisee or
licensee to identify alternate locations within public rights-ofway.
§ 173-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-11
1:477
(13) Maintenance of facilities.
(a) The franchisee or licensee shall provide and put in use all
telecommunications system facilities necessary to control and
carry franchisee's or licensee's telecommunications services so
as to prevent injury to the Town's property or property
belonging to any person, firm or corporation within the Town.
The franchisee or licensee, at its sole expense, shall repair,
renew, change and improve said facilities from time to time as
may be necessary to accomplish this purpose. The franchisee
or licensee shall not construct its telecommunications system
in a manner that requires any customer to install cables, ducts,
conduits or other facilities in, under or over the Town streets or
other public rights-of-way.
(b) Franchisee's or licensee's facilities shall be installed,
constructed, operated, maintained, used and repaired within
the franchise or license area so as to provide for the safety of
persons and property, and not to interfere with the free
passage of traffic, all in accordance with the Laws of the State
of New York and the local laws, resolution, rules and
regulations of the Town.
(c) The franchisee or licensee shall use the rights-of-way where
construction of the facilities can be coordinated with other
Town and private construction activities and will least impact
the existing condition of the rights-of-way, will least impact
traffic during construction and will least impact adjacent
neighbors during construction and after installation, all to the
extent reasonably practicable.
(14) Discontinuance, expiration or abandonment of facilities.
(a) Whenever the franchisee or licensee intends to discontinue use
of its Telecommunications System, by either expiration,
abandonment, failure to renew or default under this chapter,
the franchise agreement or license, within all or part of a
particular portion of the rights-of-way, and does not intend to
use said facilities again in the future, the franchisee or licensee
shall submit to the DPW, for the DPW's approval, a completed
application describing the facility and the date on which the
franchisee or licensee intends to discontinue using such
facility.
(b) The franchisee or licensee may remove the facility or request
that the Town permit it to remain in place. If the franchisee or
licensee is permitted to abandon its facilities in place, upon
consent of the Town, the Town shall have the right, but not the
obligation, to assume ownership of the telecommunications
system located within the rights-of-way at no cost, and the
franchisee or licensee shall deliver all documents in connection
§ 173-11 COLONIE CODE § 173-11
1:478
therewith. Notwithstanding the franchisee's or licensee's
request that any such facility remain in place, the DPW may
require the franchisee or licensee to remove its facilities from
the rights-of-way or to modify the facility in order to protect the
public health and safety or otherwise serve the public interest.
(c) The DPW may require the franchisee or licensee to perform a
combination of modification and removal of the facility. The
franchisee or licensee shall complete such removal or
modification in accordance with a schedule set by the DPW.
(d) Until such time as the franchisee or licensee removes or
modifies the facility as directed by the DPW, or until the rights
to and responsibility for the facility are accepted by another
person having authority to construct and maintain such facility,
the franchisee or licensee shall be responsible for all necessary
repairs and relocations of the facility, as well as maintenance
and restoration of the rights-of-way, in the same manner and
degree as if the facility were in active use, and the franchisee
or licensee shall retain all liability for such facility.
(15) Inspection of facilities. The Town reserves the right to require at
reasonable times, and upon reasonable notice, the inspection of
franchisee's or licensee's telecommunications system in the public
rights-of-way during installation and construction and upon
completion. The cost of such inspection, if required, shall be the
sole responsibility of the franchisee or licensee.
(16) Compliance with regulations. All work, including all working
conditions and facilities, associated with the installation,
construction, operation, maintenance and repair of the
telecommunications system shall comply with:
(a) All applicable federal, state and county laws, rules and
regulations now or hereinafter enacted and all fees, taxes and
other payments required hereunder or by such laws, codes,
rules or regulations.
(b) All applicable laws, codes, resolutions, rules and regulations of
the Town now or hereinafter enacted and all fees, taxes and
other payments required hereunder or by such laws, codes,
rules or regulations.
(c) Any insurance/bond requirements associated with street
openings in the Town shall be deemed to have been satisfied by
the franchisee's or licensee's compliance with the insurance/
bond requirements contained herein unless any other
applicable laws, rules or regulations for street openings are
stricter than those set forth herein, and in such case, the
franchisee or licensee shall comply with such stricter
requirements.
§ 173-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-11
1:479
(d) All installation, construction, maintenance and repair shall also
comply with the National Electric Safety Code (NEFC) and the
National Electric Code (NEC) and the Town shall have the right
to reasonable inspections to ensure such compliance.
(17) Construction on private property. The telecommunications System
shall ran along the public rights-of-way except to the extent that the
telecommunications system runs along private property with the
permission of the owner thereof, and shall comply with all
applicable rules and regulations. The franchisee or licensee shall
provide notice to property owners and tenants of the property prior
to the permitted construction on such private property, even in the
event that the franchisee or licensee has an easement for said
property.
(18) Public hazards. Any openings or obstructions in rights-of-way on
any Town or public property made by the franchisee or licensee
shall be guarded and protected at all times, subject to the approval
of the DPW, by the placement of adequate barriers, fences,
bordering or other protective devices and shall be clearly
designated by warning lights. The franchisee or licensee shall
indemnify the Town with respect to any claim in connection
herewith, unless caused by the Town's negligent acts, and provide
insurance therefor.
(19) Company identification. The franchisee or licensee shall ensure
that all of its vehicles and employees are clearly identified to the
general public as being associated with the franchisee or licensee
or agents thereof while engaged in construction, maintenance or
service of the telecommunications system within the Town.
(20) Condition of Town rights-of-way. The franchisee's or licensee's
telecommunications system shall be neat and sightly and shall not
unnecessarily interfere with the use of rights-of-way. The
franchisee's or licensee's cables shall be suspended or buried so as
not to endanger or injure persons or property in the rights-of-way.
All work performed by the franchisee or licensee in the rights-ofway
shall be done so as not to interfere with the use thereof and,
when completed, the same shall be left in as good condition as
when work was commenced.
(21) Noninterference with construction or utilities.
(a) All lines, cables and distribution equipment, including poles
and necessary appurtenances erected by the franchisee or
licensee within the Town, shall be located so as not to obstruct
or interfere with the proper use of rights-of-way, and other
public ways and places, and to cause minimum interference
with the rights of property owners who abut any of the said
rights-of-way, and other public ways and places, and not to
interfere with existing public utility installations or traffic
§ 173-11 COLONIE CODE § 173-11
1:480
control systems, as per standard the DPW procedures. The
franchisee or licensee shall have no vested right in any
location, and such construction shall be removed by the
franchisee or licensee at its own cost and expense whenever
the same restrictions or obstructions interfere with the
operation or location of any future operation or location of said
rights-of-way and public places.
(b) The franchisee or licensee shall not place poles, conduits or
other fixtures above- or belowground where the same will
interfere with any gas, electricity, telephone fixtures, water
hydrants, traffic control systems and loops or other utility uses,
and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures in or upon any
public rights-of-way shall be so placed as to comply with all
requirements of the Town or other applicable authority and to
comply with local regulations, including the aesthetic
provisions thereof.
(22)No liability. The Town shall not be liable to the franchisee or
licensee or to the franchisee's or licensee's customers for any
interference with or disruption in the operation of the franchisee's
or licensee's telecommunications system, or for any damages
arising out of the franchisee's or licensee's use of the public rightsof-
way, unless caused by the Town's negligent acts.
B. Records/reports required. [Amended 5-27-2004 by L.L. No. 7-2004]
(1) Records and reports. Franchisee or licensee shall keep the Town
fully informed as to all matters in connection with or affecting the
installation, construction, reconstruction, removal, maintenance,
operation and repair of franchisees or licensees
telecommunications system. In addition, if the franchise
compensation provisions of § 173-13 apply to a franchisee, the
franchisee shall also keep the Town informed as to franchisees
accounting methods and procedures in connection with the system
and with the recording and reporting by franchisee of all revenues
and uncollectibles. A franchisee shall keep its books of account and
records in such a way that breakdowns of revenues are available by
type of service within the Town. Also, the Town may require the
keeping of additional records or accounts which are reasonably
necessary for purposes of identifying, accounting for and reporting
gross revenues and uncollectibles.
(2) If a franchisee is required to pay compensation pursuant to
§ 173-13A, in order to determine the gross revenues received by
the franchisee for compensation purposes, each franchisee shall
file annually with the Town, no later than 120 days after the end of
the franchisees fiscal year, a copy of a financial report audited by
the franchisees certified public accountant covering the
telecommunications system only, showing in detail the revenues,
expenses, capital expenditures, sources and use of funds, assets
§ 173-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-11
1:481
and liabilities, a profit and loss statement and a certification that
and containing such information as the Town shall specify. Such
information or report shall be accurate and complete. The Town
may, if it sees fit, have the books and records of franchisee
examined by a representative of the Town to ascertain the
correctness of the reports agreed to be filed herein.
(3) Each franchisee and licensee shall report to the Town such other
information relating to such franchisee or licensee as the Town may
consider useful and shall comply with the Towns determination of
forms for reports, the time for reports, the frequency with which
any reports are to be made and if reports are to be made under
oath.
(4) Each franchisee or licensee shall provide the Town with access at
reasonable times and for reasonable purposes to examine, audit,
review and/or obtain copies of the papers, books, accounts,

licensee pertaining to their respective agreements. Franchisee or
licensee shall fully cooperate in making available its records and
otherwise assisting in these activities.
(5) The Town may from time to time make inquiries pertaining to a
franchisees or licensees operation of the telecommunications
system within the Town of Colonie. The franchisee or licensee shall
respond to such inquiries in a timely matter.
(6) Each franchisee or licensee shall provide the Town with notices of
all petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted
by the franchisee or licensee to the FCC, Securities and Exchange
Commission or their successor agencies relating to any matters
affecting the use of Town public rights-of-way authorized pursuant
to the franchise agreement, license or Telecommunications Local
Law. Upon written request from the Town, a franchisee or licensee
shall provide the Town with such documentation.
(7) Within 30 days of receipt, each franchisee or licensee shall submit
to the Town copies of all decisions, correspondence and actions by
any federal, state and local courts, regulatory agencies and other
governmental bodies relating to its telecommunications operations
within the public rights-of-way. This subsection shall also apply to
legal actions initiated by the franchisee or licensee. The Town shall
submit similar information to the franchisee or licensee.
(8) Information submitted to the Town is open to public inspection
under the New York State Freedom of Information Law. Each
franchisee or licensee is responsible for becoming familiar and
understanding the provisions of the New York State Freedom of
Information Law.
(9) A franchisee or licensee may identify information, such as trade
secrets, financial records, customer information or technical
§ 173-11 COLONIE CODE § 173-11
1:482
information, submitted to the Town as confidential under the New
York State Freedom of Information Law. The franchisee or licensee
shall prominently mark any information for which it claims
confidentiality with the word Confidential, on each page of such
information, prior to submitting such information to the Town. The
Town shall treat any material so marked as confidential, until the
Town receives any request for disclosure of such information. To
the extent authorized by the Freedom of Information Law and
other applicable state and federal law, the Town shall maintain the
confidentiality of information designated as such by the franchisee
or licensee. Within five working days of receiving any such request,
the Town shall provide the franchisee or licensee with written
notice of request, including a copy of the request. A franchisee or
licensee shall have five working days within which to provide a
written response to the Town before the Town may disclose any
of the requested confidential information. The Town shall retain
the final discretion to determine whether to release the requested
confidential information in accordance with applicable laws.
C. Insurance requirements. The franchisee or licensee shall obtain and
maintain in full force and effect throughout the term of their respective
agreements, and any extensions or renewals thereof, insurance with an
insurance company licensed to do business in the State of New York.
Said insurance shall protect the franchisee or licensee and the Town
from any claims which may arise directly or indirectly or result from its
granting of a franchise agreement or license, including but not limited
to activity associated with the placement or maintenance of the
franchisee's or licensee's telecommunications system, whether such
operations are performed by the franchisee or licensee or by anyone for
whose acts the franchisee or licensee may be liable. The Town reserves
the right to review these insurance requirements during the effective
period of the franchise agreement or license, and any extension or
renewal thereof, and to adjust insurance coverage and their limits when
deemed necessary and prudent by the Town Attorney, based upon
changes in statutory law, court decisions or the claims history of the
industry or the franchisee or licensee.
(1) The insurance to be maintained by the franchisee or licensee shall
include, but shall not be limited to, the following:
(a) Workers' compensation and employees' liability insurance
supplied in statutory amounts providing protection for
employees of the franchisee or licensee in the event of jobrelated
injuries.
(b) Automobile liability policies with the limits of not less than
$1,000,000 for each accident because of bodily injury, sickness
or disease sustained by any person, including death at any
time, caused by accident and arising out of the ownership,
maintenance or use of any automobiles. In addition, the
automobile liability policies shall have limits of not less than
§ 173-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-11

$1,000,000 for each accident for damage to property, including
all resulting loss of use thereof, caused by accident and arising

additional insureds, as the interests of each insured may
appear, as to all applicable coverage.
(b) The policy shall provide for 30 days' notice to the Town
Attorney for cancellation, nonrenewal or material change.
(c) The policy shall provide that all provisions of the franchise
agreement or license, as amended, concerning liability, duty
and standard of care, including indemnity of this agreement,
shall be underwritten by contractual coverage sufficient to
include such obligations within applicable policies.
(d) Insurers shall have no right of recovery against the Town, it
being the intention that the insurance policies shall protect the
franchisee or licensee and the Town and shall be primary
coverage for all losses covered by the policies.
(e) The policy clause "other insurance," shall not apply to the Town
where the Town is an insured on the policy.
(f) Companies issuing the insurance policies shall have no
recourse against the Town for payment of any premiums or
assessments which are all set at the sole risk of the franchisee
or licensee.
D. Faithful performance bond. The franchisee or licensee shall obtain and
maintain, at its sole cost and expense, and file with the Town Attorney, a
corporate surety bond which shall be annually renewable or multi-year,
with a surety company authorized to do business in the State of New
York and found acceptable by the Town Attorney, in the amount of 25%
of the total project cost to secure franchisee's or licensee's faithful
performance of its obligations and faithful adherence to all of the terms
and conditions of the franchise agreement or license. The franchisee or
licensee shall pay all premiums charged for the bond, and shall keep the
bond in full force and effect at all times throughout the term of the
§ 173-11 COLONIE CODE § 173-11
1:484
franchise agreement or license, including, if necessary, the time
required for removal of all of the franchisee's or licensee's
telecommunications system facilities installed in the Town's rights-ofway.
Each such bond shall contain a covenant or endorsement of the
surety to provide 60 days' written notice to the Town Attorney and the
franchisee or licensee of such surety's intention to cancel, substantially
change, or not to renew such bond. The franchisee or licensee shall,
in the event of such notice, obtain, pay premiums for and file with the
Town Attorney written evidence of the issuance of replacement bonds
prior to the expiration of any such bond.
(1) The bond shall provide, but not be limited to, the following
condition: There shall be recovery by the Town, jointly and
severally from the principal and surety, any and all damages, losses
or costs suffered by the Town resulting from the failure of the
franchisee or licensee to adhere to the terms and conditions of the
franchisee agreement or license. The Town's right to recover under
the bond shall be in addition to any other rights it may have
pursuant to this chapter, a franchise agreement or a license.
(2) If the financial conditions of any bonding company issuing a bond
pursuant to this section materially and adversely change, the Town
may, at any time, require that any such bond be replaced with such
other bond consistent with the requirements set forth in this
section.
(3) The Commissioner of Public Works reserves the right to stop any
work related to the telecommunications system until proper
evidence of bonding is furnished.
E. Assignment/transfer.
(1) The franchisee or licensee may not assign its rights and/or
obligations hereunder without the Town's consent except to any
subsidiary, parent company or affiliate of the franchisee or licensee
or pursuant to any financing, merger or reorganization of the
franchisee or licensee; provided that the franchisee or licensee
shall have given the Town written notice of such assignment not
less than 30 days after the date on which such assignment became
effective. Such assignment shall not discharge the franchisee or
licensee from liability or responsibility for the performance of the
franchisee's or licensee's obligations under this chapter, franchise
agreement or a license.
(2) In the event of assignment to any other third party by the
franchisee or licensee, such assignment shall be subject to and

transferee.
(b) An agreement from the proposed buyer, lessee, mortgagee,
assignee or transferee assuming the provisions of this chapter,

the Town and an opportunity to meet and interview the
proposed assignee or transferee.
(3) In the event that the franchisee or licensee complies with the
foregoing, the Town shall not unreasonably withhold its consent so
long as:
(a) The franchisee or licensee shall have paid the Town any
reasonable costs incurred by the Town to review the requested
consent, including, without limitation, attorney's fees;
(b) The proposed assignee or transferee is a reputable entity and
the Town has been furnished with reasonable proof thereof;
(c) The proposed assignee or transferee is of sound financial
condition as reasonably determined by the Town given the
obligations to be assumed by the proposed assignee or
transferee; and
(d) The proposed assignee or transferee agrees to enter into an
agreement approved by the Town, which assumes the
obligations under this chapter, franchise agreement or license.
F. Remaining terms and conditions. The remaining terms and conditions
applicable to any franchise or license granted pursuant to this chapter
shall be set forth in the separate resolution granting the franchise or
license and/or in the franchise or the license itself.
A. It shall be the responsibility of each applicant to comply with all
applicable laws, ordinances, resolutions, rules, regulations and other
directives of the Town and any federal, state or local governmental
authority having jurisdiction.
§ 173-11 COLONIE CODE § 173-12
1:486
§ 173-13. Franchise compensation.
B. In addition, all use of the Town rights-of-way shall conform to all
federal, state or local highway laws and the Town's highway and
drainage standards which are available at the Department of Public
Works. Any repair to, or replacement of, any Town infrastructure must
be done in accordance with the applicable Department of Public Works
standards or specifications. To minimize the impact on the Town
infrastructure, trenchless technology shall be the preferred method of
installation.
C. Prior to final approval, the applicant shall acquire a faithful
performance bond for the Town to cover the cost associated with the
restoration of the Town rights-of-way and affected Town utilities. Such
bond shall be accompanied by a properly executed agreement between
the Town and the applicant.
D. Those applicants who wish to utilize certain public rights-of-way to
install, construct, operate or maintain their telecommunication system
within the Town shall be required to obtain a license with the Town for
such use when:
(1) The use or occupation of such public rights-of-way does not involve
the offering or provision of telecommunication services to any
person within the Town (i.e., merely passing through); or
(2) The use or occupation of such public rights-of-way is for or in
connection with the internal operations of such person's business,
residence or employment and not for or in connection with the
provision or offering of telecommunications services for sale or
resale to any person.
E. Those applicants who wish to use the Town rights-of-way and will be
providing services within the Town shall be required to obtain a
franchise with the Town for such use.
A. Nondiscrimination. Although the provisions of this chapter apply to all
telecommunications providers, no person subject to this chapter shall
be required to pay compensation as set forth in the remainder of this
§ 173-13 until the Town enters into an agreement with the incumbent
local telecommunications provider, in which the incumbent local
telecommunications provider agrees to pay compensation pursuant to
or equivalent to that required by this § 173-13. [Added 5-27-2004 by
L.L. No. 7-200439]
B. Compensation required. For the reason that the public rights-of-way, to
be used by franchisee in the operation of its telecommunications system
within the boundaries of the Town, are valuable public properties,
acquired and maintained by the Town at great expense to its taxpayers,
39.Editor's Note: This local law also provided for the redesignation of former Subsections A
through C as Subsections B through D, respectively.
§ 173-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 173-13
1:487
§ 173-14. License compensation. [Amended 5-27-2004 by L.L. No.
7-2004]
and that the grant to the franchisee of the use of said public rights-ofway,
is a valuable property right without which the franchisee would
be required to invest substantial capital in rights-of-way costs and
acquisitions, the franchisee agrees to pay to the Town as general
compensation, during each year of the franchise agreement, a sum
equal to the greater of the minimum annual fee or the annual grossrevenue-
based fee, as set forth below. In those instances where the
telecommunications provider's system is within the Town's rights-ofway
but it is not providing telecommunications services within the
Town, the fee will be as set forth in § 173-14.
C. Annual gross-revenue-based fee. As compensation for the rights and
privileges granted by this franchise, the franchisee shall pay to the
Town an annual fee equal to 5% of its gross revenues, as defined by this
Agreement. The payment of the aforesaid fees shall in no way be
construed to include the payment of real estate taxes or permit and
application fees to the Town, nor shall such franchise fee constitute a
deduction from gross revenues for the purposes of computing the
amount of franchise fee due.
D. Minimum annual fee. Notwithstanding the fee calculation set forth
above, the franchisee shall pay to the Town a minimum annual franchise
fee, unless the calculation required above results in a payment greater
than the minimum annual fee set forth herein. Such minimum fee shall
be $5,000. However, the minimum annual fee for subsequent years
shall equal the highest amount paid to the Town as fees for the previous
year. The payment of the aforesaid fees shall in no way be construed to
include the payment of real estate taxes or permit and application fees
to the Town, nor shall such franchise fee constitute a deduction from
the minimum annual fee for the purposes of computing the amount of
franchise fee due.
A. Nondiscrimination. Although the provisions of this chapter apply to all
telecommunications providers, no person subject to this chapter shall
be required to pay compensation as set forth in the remainder of this
§ 173-14 until the Town enters into an agreement with the incumbent

§ 177-1. Findings.
The Town Board of the Town of Colonie hereby finds that excessive cutting
of trees upon large tracts of land has resulted in creating increased surface
drainage and increased soil erosion, thereby causing increased municipal
costs to control drainage within the Town and impairing the benefits of
occupancy of existing residential and commercial property in such areas
and impairing the stability and value of both improved and unimproved real
property in such areas with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting
health, safety and general welfare of the inhabitants of the Town.
§ 177-2. Development plan requirements.
It is hereby enacted by the Town Board of the Town of Colonie that in
presenting plans of developments for approval by the Planning Board,
either residential or commercial developments, that the applicants must, in
have approval plus the actual costs incurred by the Town in enforcing
this chapter against the person. In such an instance, the offender shall
be required to remove all equipment illegally placed in the Town rightsof-
way and to restore said property to its original condition in addition
to any other penalty provided by law. Failure to properly follow the
procedures in this chapter may result in the forfeiture of consideration
for future permits by the applicant.
C. In the event that a permit has been issued to an applicant by the Town,
failure to comply with the requirements set forth by law and all
standards required by the Town may additionally result in the forfeiture
of the escrow deposit, or a portion thereof, and/or forfeiture of the
permit as determined by the Department of Public Works.

removed.
§ 177-3. Restrictions on cutting and removal.
The Planning Board of the Town of Colonie is empowered to require that
trees will be left standing in areas upon the plat or subdivision, and no live
tree exceeding three inches in diameter may be cut down in such areas
without expressed consent of the Planning Board, to be indicated upon the
approved plan. The Planning Board may also require that trees shall not be
cut down on or removed from any building plot on the subdivision unless the
area is to be occupied by the building thereon. In such instance trees may
be cut down in area to be occupied by buildings or driveways and within a
distance of 10 feet around the perimeter of such buildings or driveways.

[Adopted 4-8-1954]
§ 188-1. Purpose.
The purpose and intent of this article is to conserve and protect the water
supply of the Latham Water District by limiting, restricting and/or
prohibiting its use for certain purposes during periods of emergency as
hereinafter defined, in the interest of public health, safety and welfare.
§ 188-2. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
EMERGENCY  Covers and includes an actual or threatened shortage of
water caused by drought, by the breakdown of the pumping system or the
filtration plant or any part of the distribution system, by a power shortage
or failure, by the declaration of a civil defense alert or by any other similar
occurrence deemed by the Town Board to justify its action as hereinafter set
forth.
§ 188-3. Declaration of emergency.
Whenever, in the opinion of the Town Board, it becomes necessary because
of the existence of an emergency as hereinbefore defined to conserve the
water supply of said district by limiting, restricting or prohibiting its use,
the Town Board may, at a regular or special meeting thereof, adopt a
resolution declaring such emergency.
§ 188-4. Contents of resolution.
Such resolution may:
A. Direct the Superintendent of the Water Department to prepare a
proclamation prohibiting all users of said water supply from using the
same or any part thereof for the sprinkling or irrigation of lawns,
ornamental plants, shrubs or trees or domestic gardens, washing motor
vehicles or limiting such use to certain hours of the day or certain days
of the week; and/or
B. Direct said Superintendent to prepare a proclamation limiting,
prohibiting or restricting the use of said water by a specified customer,
by specified classes/or groups of customers or by customers located
within a certain specified area of the district for the same purposes as
set forth in Subsection A of this section and/or for the purpose of filling
swimming pools, operating air-conditioning installments or in
connection with the operation of any commercial or manufacturing
processes.
§ 188-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 188-5
1:601
§ 188-5. Contents of proclamation.
Said proclamation shall specify the duration of the limitation, prohibition or
restriction, if practical; otherwise such limitation, prohibition or restriction
shall continue in full force and effect until the Town Board shall by
appropriate resolution declare that the emergency no longer exists.
§ 188-6. Publication and posting of proclamation.
If such resolution declares a general emergency to exist, such proclamation
shall be published in two or more newspapers having general circulation
throughout the district, and copies thereof shall be posted in at least 10
public places within the district.
§ 188-7. Local or limited emergency.
If such resolution declares a local or limited emergency to exist, within the
purview of § 188-4B of this article and but a small or limited number of
customers are affected thereby, the preparation, publication and posting of
such proclamation may be dispensed with; in which case, the service upon
the customers affected by such prohibition, limitation or restriction of a
certified copy of the resolution declaring such emergency shall be sufficient
notice thereof.
§ 188-8. Procedure upon determination of termination of
emergency.
§ 188-9. Prohibitions.
From and after the date of such publication and posting or personal service,
as the case may be, and during the period specified therein, or until the

the emergency previously declared, it shall be unlawful for any person, firm
or corporation having the use of said water supply of said district to use
any part of the water so supplied for the purpose or purposes described in
said resolution and proclamation or notice in violation of the prohibitions,
limitations or restrictions therein set forth.
A. Upon the Town Board declaring that an emergency as to which a

This chapter shall be known and may be cited as the "Wireless
Telecommunications Facilities Siting Law."
§ 189-2. Purpose and legislative intent.
The Telecommunications Act of 1996 affirmed the Town of Colonie's
authority to make reasonable, nondiscriminatory decisions concerning the
placement, construction and modification of wireless telecommunications
facilities. The Town of Colonie finds that wireless telecommunications
facilities may pose significant concerns to the health, safety, public welfare,
character and environment of the Town and its inhabitants. The Town also
recognizes that facilitating the development of wireless service technology
can be an economic development asset to the Town and of significant
benefit to the Town and its residents. In order to insure that the placement,
construction or modification of wireless telecommunications facilities is
consistent with the Town's land use policies, the Town is adopting a single,
comprehensive, wireless telecommunications facilities application and
permit process. It is the purpose of this chapter to accommodate the
communications needs of residents and businesses consistent with the
applicable federal and state laws and regulations, while protecting the
health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Town by
facilitating the provision of wireless telecommunications and other
communication services to the residents and businesses of the Town while
simultaneously preserving the character, appearance, aesthetic resources,
environmental features and property value of the Town by:
A. Requiring a wireless telecommunications special use permit for any
new, co-location or modification of a wireless telecommunications
facility;
B. Implementing a fair, consistent and efficient application process for
persons seeking a wireless telecommunications special use permit;
C. Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the sharing and/or colocation
of wireless telecommunications facilities among service
providers;
D. Promoting and encouraging, wherever possible, the placement, height
and visual quality of wireless telecommunications facilities in such a

ARTICLE IV
Establishment of Zoning Districts and Map
§ 190-16. Base zoning district classifications.
For the purpose of this chapter, the Town of Colonie, except the portion
thereof that is within the limits of an incorporated village, is hereby divided
into the following classes of zoning districts. These descriptions are
intended to indicate the general intent of each district and are not
definitive. Specific use and area standards for each district are provided in
the use regulations and dimensional requirements articles of this chapter.54
A. SFR  Single Family Residential District. The purpose of the Single
Family Residential District (SFR) is to provide areas primarily for
single-family residential development in the form of detached
dwellings. The purpose is to create neighborhoods where people live
and conduct their domestic activities. The Single Family Residential
District is characterized by traditional suburban residential
development.
B. MFR  Multifamily Residential District. The purpose of the Multifamily
Residential District (MFR) is to encourage diversity in residential
development, including single-family, two-family and multifamily
dwellings, and to protect the existing residential character from
encroachment by inappropriate nonresidential development.
C. OR  Office Residential District. The Office Residential District (OR) is
a mixed-use district with a focus on the integration of office and
residential with no retail uses. This district is intended to serve as a
transition between districts of higher intensity uses and residential
districts. The scale of development is intended to relate to the scale of
the adjacent residential neighborhood.
D. CO  Commercial Office District. The Commercial Office District (CO)
is characterized by primarily commercial and office land uses with
limited accessory retail services. Residential land uses are not allowed
in this district. These areas allow the development community the
flexibility to build creative and world class office spaces.
E. NCOR  Neighborhood Commercial Office Residential District. The
purpose of the Neighborhood Commercial Office Residential District
(NCOR) is to promote the development of mixed-use, pedestrianfriendly
development in neighborhood areas at a scale consistent with
small neighborhood uses. This district provides for the intermixing of
neighborhood commercial, office, and residential land uses. This
neighborhood-scale mixed-use district will help reduce the need for
excessive parking and lay the foundation for an increase in the use of
public transit and pedestrian access. Flexibility is the key to this
54.Editor's Note: See Art. V, Use Regulations, and Art. VI, Dimensional Requirements and
Density Incentives.
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-16
1:669
district, allowing a mix of uses based on the ability of the applicant
to be creative. The NCOR District will unify these varied uses through
design. Elements such as limited front yard setbacks; two- or threestory
buildings with active retail and service uses on the ground floors;
on-street parking, where appropriate, and off-street parking on the side
or rear of buildings will be encouraged in this district through the use
of design standards.
F. COR  Commercial Office Residential District. The purpose of the
Commercial Office Residential District (COR) is to promote the
development of mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly areas. This district
provides for the intermixing of commercial, office and residential land
uses. The mixed-use district will help reduce the need for excessive
parking and lay the foundation for an increase in the use of public
transit. Flexibility is the key to this district, allowing a mix of uses based
on the ability of the applicant to be creative. The COR District will unify
these varied uses through superior design. Elements such as limited
front yard setbacks; multistory buildings with retail, food service and
other active uses on the ground floors; on-street parking, where
appropriate, and off-street parking on the side or rear of buildings will
be encouraged in this district through the use of design standards.
G. HCOR  Highway Commercial Office Residential District. The purpose
of the Highway Commercial Office Residential District (HCOR) is to
promote the development of mixed-use areas that will also allow for
larger format retail development. This district provides for the
intermixing of commercial, office and residential uses. The mixing of
uses in this district will help reduce the need for excessive parking and
lay the foundation for an increase in the use of public transit. Flexibility
is the key to this district, allowing a mix of uses based on the ability of
the applicant to be creative. The HCOR District will unify these varied
uses through superior design. Elements such as limited front yard
setbacks; multistory buildings with retail, food service and other active
uses on the ground floors; on-street parking, where appropriate, and
off-street parking on the side or rear of the buildings will be encouraged
in this district through the use of design standards. The design
standards will also aim to create an environment that is as pedestrianfriendly
as possible, where appropriate. Additionally, the HCOR District
will allow for commercial automobile-services activities, including
commercial and retail support uses. The district will consolidate retail
uses such as shopping malls and large format retailers. Design
guidelines will be fostered to consider neighboring land uses.
H. PDD  Planned Development District. The purpose of a planned
development district (PDD) is to allow for flexible land use and design
for parcels where the objectives of Colonie's zoning and planning
documents as well as the needs of the community can be achieved by
creative planning and design. The planned development district should
allow development that is matched to the unique characteristics of its
site and allow innovative development techniques that might not
§ 190-16 COLONIE CODE § 190-16
1:670
§ 190-17. Boundary descriptions.
otherwise be possible through strict application of standard use, area,
bulk and density specifications.
I. IND  Industrial District. The purpose of the Industrial District (IND) is
to encourage the development of light and heavy industrial uses that
require highway access to move goods and materials. These areas
provide critical economic development opportunities and allow the
Town to grow its industrial base. These areas are prime locations for
revitalization and redevelopment.
J. ABA  Airport Business Area District. The Airport Business Area
District (ABA) is characterized by a variety of uses, including office and
commercial. Many businesses in this district are associated with the
airport and transportation infrastructure, such as warehousing and
multi-modal distribution. Development within this district must be
compatible with the airport and associated uses.
K. LC  Land Conservation District. The purpose of the Land
Conservation District (LC) is to maintain land areas that contain
important environmental and natural resources. Many of the land
conservation areas are already protected or preserved open space
areas.
L. CEM  Cemetery District. The purpose of the Cemetery District (CEM)
is to allow for the operation and maintenance of a cemetery and the
buildings and structures incidental and necessary to those operations.
Associated uses such as crematories and funeral homes will also be
permitted in the Cemetery District.
A. The boundaries of the land use and overlay districts are hereby
established on the map entitled "Town of Colonie Zoning Map" adopted
by the Town Board and certified by the Town Clerk, which accompanies
and is hereby declared to be a part of this chapter.55
B. Regardless of other existing printed copies of the Zoning Map, which
will be reproduced or published from time to time, the Official Zoning
Map, which shall be on file with the Town Clerk, shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of the land and water areas,
buildings, and other structures in the Town.
C. Interpretation of zoning district boundaries. Where uncertainty exists
as to the boundaries of the zoning districts as shown on the Zoning
Map, the following rules shall apply:
(1) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
the center line or right-of-way line of streets, alleys or highways,
55.Editor's Note: The Zoning Map is on file and available in Town offices for inspection
during normal business hours.
§ 190-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-17
1:671
such lines shall be construed to be district boundaries and follow
such center lines.
(2) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
a stream, lake or other body of water, such stream center line, lake
or body of water shoreline shall be construed to be such district
boundaries (unless otherwise noted on the Zoning Map), in the
event of a change in the shoreline or stream, the district
boundaries shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline
or stream.
(3) Where district boundaries are indicated as approximately following
platted lot lines, they shall be construed to follow such lot lines.
(4) Where district boundaries are not indicated as approximately
following the items listed above or are not designated on the
Zoning Map, the boundary line shall be determined by the use of
the scale designated on the Zoning Map, with reference to lot lines,
street boundaries or other such points of reference.
(5) Where overlay district boundaries are based upon natural features,
such as slopes, topographic contour lines, watershed boundaries,
soil types or ecological communities, such boundaries may be more
precisely established through field investigation by a qualified
professional.
(6) In the event that none of the above rules are applicable, or in the
event that further clarification or definition is considered necessary
or appropriate, the location of a district boundary shall be
determined by the Zoning Board of Appeals.
(7) Any portion of the Town not otherwise included within a specified
district shall be considered to be within a Land Conservation
District.

A. Purpose and objectives. It is the purpose of this section of the Town of
Colonie Land Use Law to authorize the Planning Board to grant
incentives to project sponsors during the plan review process. Such
incentives shall advance the Town's comprehensive planning policies
and provide opportunities to preserve open spaces in the Town with an
approximate equivalence between the open space that may be lost or
gained, as articulated in the Town's Comprehensive Plan and other
current planning studies.
B. Authority of the Planning Board. Incentive zoning provisions may be
used by the Planning Board to further the following Town objectives:
(1) To protect the Town's important natural resources such as stream
corridors, steep slopes, floodplains, wetland systems, wildlife
habitats and unique ecosystems.
(2) To encourage the conservation of viable farmland and significant
open spaces.
(3) To develop a network of open lands to provide wildlife habitat and
potential recreational trail corridors, connections, and pathways.
(4) To protect the Town's significant cultural and historic resources.
(5) To focus development and redevelopment into mixed-use centers.
(6) To ensure that all development occurs in an ecologically sound
manner so that the Town can improve air and water quality.
(7) To protect viewsheds, scenic roads and environmentally sensitive
lands.
(8) To encourage the use of conservation development throughout the
Town but particularly in environmentally sensitive or ecologically
unique areas such as the Albany Pine Bush, the Mohawk and
Hudson Rivers and tributaries, the Town's creeks, the Ashford Glen
Preserve, Ann Lee Pond and Shaker Heritage Site, Kettle Bog,
Stump Pond and other significant areas.
(9) To protect and enhance the Town's recreational resources.
(10) To provide public access to protected open spaces.
(11) To allow for an increased density of both commercial and
residential development while enhancing and protecting a diversity
of housing types.
§ 190-26 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-27
1:691
C. Applicability. Incentives for increased density may only be used in the
following districts as shown on the Town of Colonie Zoning Map: Office
Residential (OR), Commercial Office (CO), Neighborhood Commercial
Office Residential (NCOR), Commercial Office Residential (COR),
Highway Commercial Office Residential (HCOR), Airport Business Area
(ABA), and Industrial (IND).
D. Incentive standards. [Amended 3-24-2016 by L.L. No. 2-2016]

space requirement in increments of 5%.
(2) Required green space shall not be reduced below 15%.
(3) Residential density shall not exceed eight dwelling units per acre.
(4) The Planning Board in its discretion may grant an increase in
project density for commercial or mixed-use projects up to 24,000
square feet of gross floor area (GFA) per acre.
(5) If the lot where the incentive is requested is in more than one
district, the provisions for the more restrictive district shall apply.
(6) If a project seeks incentive zoning for both density increase and
green space reduction, then both fee schedules shall apply.
(7) In mixed-use developments, 3,000 gross square feet of commercial
space shall equal one dwelling unit.
(8) Owners of previously developed parcels of land containing less
than the 35% minimum green space required by the zoning
standards (190 Attachment 271), but at least meeting the 15%
green space required by this section may be permitted by the
Planning Board to redevelop the parcel without fine or penalty so
long as the redeveloped parcel maintains or exceeds its current
percentage of green space. A "previously developed parcel of land"
is one that met the zoning and site plan requirements in effect at
the time it was approved and has been lawfully developed and
maintained thereafter.
(9) Previously developed parcels of land with a density greater than
18,000 square feet per acre but less than the 24,000 square feet of
GFA per acre may be redeveloped without fine or penalty so long as
the redeveloped parcel maintains or decreases its current density.
A "previously developed parcel of land" is one that met the zoning
and site plan requirements in effect at the time it was approved and
has been lawfully developed and maintained thereafter.

Board may reject amenities that are not of sufficient and equitable
value to merit an incentive.
(a) Permanent conservation easements: agricultural conservation,
open space, scenic, ecological, historic or other types of
permanent conservation easements. Proof of recording of
easement is required prior to issuance of any building permit

an incentive.
(e) Any combination of the above.
(2) These amenities will be in addition to any other mandated
requirements pursuant to other provisions of the Town of Colonie
Code and any other applicable law or regulation.
(3) The Town of Colonie Town Board shall adopt incentive unit
schedules for both green space reduction and density increase,

ARTICLE VII
Overlay Districts
§ 190-29. General provisions for overlay districts.
Overlay districts do not change the use and dimensional requirements of
the underlying land use district unless specifically stated in this article.
They are not intended to prohibit development but rather to assure that the
siting and design of development is sensitive to environmental and historic
resources and constraints.
§ 190-30. Conservation Development Overlay District.
A. Purpose. The purpose of the Conservation Development Overlay
District is to require the use of conservation development design
principles to preserve open space and viable agricultural lands. The
Conservation Overlay District is intended to protect the Town's natural
environment, provide for a balance between developed and
undeveloped land, protect air quality, and to provide adequate open
areas for recreation and conservation. Conservation development is a
form of design that preserves important natural resources and open
space while still allowing for development to occur. The following
provisions intend to achieve a balance between well-designed
development, meaningful open space conservation, and natural
resource protection in the portions of the Town of Colonie covered by
the Conservation Development Overlay. Conservation development will
preserve tracts of environmentally, scenically and recreationally
significant undeveloped land and preserve contiguous open spaces and
important scenic and environmental resources while allowing compact
development and creating more walkable and bikeable neighborhoods.
B. Applicability. These regulations shall apply to all site plan development
and subdivisions of property within the Conservation Development
Overlay unless:
(1) The development is a minor site plan development.
(2) The development is classified as a minor subdivision as defined in
the subdivision article of this chapter.72
(3) The Planning Board determines, based upon the conservation
analysis outlined below, that there is no reasonable basis for
requiring conservation development. The Board may then approve
a conventional development of the site. In order for the Planning
Board to make such a determination, the applicant must
demonstrate at least one of the following:
(a) The land contains no resources with conservation value;
72.Editor's Note: See Art. XII, Subdivision.
§ 190-29 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-30
1:695
(b) The acreage is too small to preserve a substantial amount of
land with conservation value (this criterion shall not be
circumvented by piecemeal subdivision of larger tracts); or
(c) The lot configuration is unique and precludes preservation of a
substantial amount of land with conservation value.
(4) In order to make the required showing, the applicant must also
demonstrate that the parcel does not adjoin other land that, when
combined with open space on the parcel, would result in the
preservation of a substantial amount of land with conservation
value (including any portion of a designated trail corridor),
regardless of whether or not the adjoining parcels have been
protected as open space.
(5) An approval of a conservation development shall refer to the
conservation findings and may be conditioned upon the protection
by conservation easement of portions of the site identified in the
conservation analysis and findings as having conservation value.
C. Standards for conservation development.
(1) Density calculation.
(a) Residential. The number of residential units permitted on a lot
is calculated following the steps below:
[1] Determine the acreage of unconstrained land on the lot.
Unconstrained land is the total acreage of the proposed
development parcel excluding constrained land.
[2] Determine the number of permitted residential units on
the lot. Multiply the acres of unconstrained land by the
base residential density for the district, as set forth in the
Dimensional Table included in the dimensional
requirements and density incentives article of this
chapter.73 Round down fractional units of 0.5 or less and
round up fractional units greater than 0.5. The resulting
number is the base residential density.
(b) Commercial. The allowable commercial development on a lot is
calculated following the steps below:
[1] Determine the acreage of unconstrained land on the lot.
Unconstrained land is the total acreage of the proposed
development parcel excluding constrained land.
[2] Determine the permitted gross floor area on the lot.
Multiply the acres of unconstrained land by the base
commercial density for the district, as set forth in the
Dimensional Table included in the dimensional
73.Editor's Note: The Dimensional Table is included at the end of this chapter.
§ 190-30 COLONIE CODE § 190-30
1:696
requirements and density incentives article of this chapter.
Round down fractional units of 0.5 or less and round up
fractional units greater than 0.5. The resulting number is
the base commercial density. [Amended 8-28-2008 by
L.L. No. 8-2008]
(c) Density increase. Pursuant to the incentives section of this
chapter,74 the base residential and/or commercial density, as
determined above, may be increased.
D. Conservation analysis.
(1) As part of its site plan or subdivision review, an applicant shall
prepare a conservation analysis, consisting of inventory maps,
description of the land and an analysis of the conservation value of
various site features. The conservation analysis shall show lands
with conservation value, including but not limited to the following:
(a) Constrained land.
(b) Open space and recreational resources.
(c) Buffer areas (define to include screening and environmental
buffers).
(d) Land exhibiting present or potential recreational, historic,
archeological, ecological, agricultural, water resource, scenic
or other natural resource values.
(2) The conservation analysis shall describe the importance and the
current and potential conservation value of all land on the site. In
the course of conceptual site plan or subdivision review, the
Planning Board shall indicate to the applicant which of the lands
identified as being of conservation value are most important to
preserve.
(3) The outcome of the conservation analysis and the Planning Board's
determination shall be the identification of land to be preserved by
a permanent easement. The conceptual site plan or subdivision
plan shall also show preferred locations for intensive development
as well as acceptable locations for less dense development.
(4) The final determination as to which land has the most conservation
value and should be protected from development shall be made by
the Planning Board. Whenever the Planning Board approves a plan
with protected open space, it shall make written findings
identifying the specific conservation values protected and the
reasons for protecting such land (the "conservation findings"). The
Planning Board shall not approve development without a complete
74.Editor's Note See § 190-27, Incentive zoning.
§ 190-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-30
1:697
conservation analysis sufficient for the Board to make its
conservation findings.
(5) The Planning Board may determine that limited areas of
constrained land may be disturbed in order to secure a reasonable
development of the site consistent with the findings of the
conservation analysis. In that event, a portion of the site twice the
area of the constrained lands to be disturbed shall be set aside from
the lands identified as being of conservation value and treated as
constrained lands for the purposes of the density calculation and
concept plan preparation.
(6) The conceptual plan shall show the constrained land identified by
the analysis described above and at least 40% of the land not
constrained as land to be preserved.
E. Lot sizes in conservation subdivisions.
(1) After the final residential and/or commercial densities are
determined, there shall be no mandatory minimum lot size in a
conservation development. The Planning Board shall determine
appropriate lot sizes in the course of its review.
(2) In order to permit a clustered lot configuration, wells and septic
systems may be located in common areas of protected open space,
provided that necessary easements are provided for maintenance
of these facilities.
F. Other area and dimensional requirements. [Amended 8-28-2008 by
L.L. No. 8-2008]
(1) There shall be no minimum required area, bulk, or dimensional
standards in a conservation development, except that where such
development abuts an existing single-family dwelling, a suitable
buffer area shall be required by the Planning Board.
(2) The applicant shall specify dimensional requirements for a
proposed conservation subdivision by identifying setbacks and
other lot dimensions to be incorporated into the final site plan or
subdivision plan, subject to review and approval by the Planning
Board.
G. Conservation development design.
(1) Compliance with subdivision rules and regulations. All
requirements of the rules and regulations of the Planning Board
with respect to the development and approval of subdivision plans
shall be complied with except insofar as the same may conflict with
specific requirements set forth herein. Where the requirements of
this article conflict with those contained in the subdivision
regulations of this chapter, the specific requirements set forth in
this article shall control.
§ 190-30 COLONIE CODE § 190-30
1:698
(2) Lots shall be arranged in a manner that protects land with
conservation value and facilitates pedestrian and bicycle
circulation. Permitted building locations or areas ("building
envelopes") shall be shown on the final site plan and/or subdivision
plan.
(3) Parking. Parking spaces shall be a minimum of nine feet wide and
18 feet long. Each dwelling unit shall have at least two exterior offstreet
parking spaces. Common parking areas shall also be
provided, with at least 1/2 additional parking space for each
dwelling unit. These common parking areas shall be no further than
250 feet from the dwelling unit they are intended to serve. The
Planning Board may waive the requirement for common parking
areas if the applicant demonstrates that sufficient exterior offstreet
parking is available on the individual lots. Curbing, fencing
or other physical barriers shall be provided as approved by the
Planning Board to prevent encroachment onto landscaped areas by
vehicles.
(4) Snow clearance and removal. The means employed to remove snow
and ice from sidewalks, parking lots and driveways must be
sufficient to safely and adequately handle the volume of snow and
ice reasonably anticipated to be deposited by nature on the site,
without subjecting green space areas to damage, and while
maintaining the minimum required parking spaces. Provisions for
winter snow storage for common parking areas shall be included as
an integral part of the project plan, and such snow storage
provisions shall not reduce the number of parking spaces beyond
the minimum number established by these rules. A plan for snow
removal rather than storage shall not be an acceptable alternate.
(5) Design elements review. The design elements of the project shall be
in harmony with the natural environment and in keeping with the
character of the adjacent land uses.
H. Special standards for areas influenced by Albany Pine Bush Preserve.
(1) Native Albany Pine Bush species will be used to landscape new
commercial, industrial and residential buildings to the greatest
extent practicable. New landscaping shall not consist of known
invasive species. A list of native Albany Pine Bush species shall be
made available at the applicant's request.
(2) Sufficient open space shall be provided to permanently protect
ravines, major dunes, pine barrens vernal ponds, rare and
endangered species habitat or to connect other preservation lands.
All development proposals will be designed in such a way as to
ensure the proper management of the open space lands and shall
be consistent with the conservation development concept.
Protection efforts can include, but are not limited to, land
§ 190-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-30
1:699
dedications to the Albany Pine Bush Preserve, set-asides, donations
and conservation easements.
(3) Where practical, parking shall be provided by several small lots as
opposed to one large one.
(4) There should be no general leveling and clearing of any site.
Construction should follow the contour of the land and not destroy
trees or natural features except where necessary for the building of
foundations and approved parking and paved areas.
(5) All lighting fixtures used to provide exterior security or parking lot
lighting shall utilize high-pressure sodium vapor lights as opposed
to mercury vapor or other lighting fixtures and otherwise comply
with Town lighting requirements. The use of excessive dusk-todawn
exterior lighting shall be discouraged.
(6) Where practical and when excess sand from projects is available,
applicants should consider donating such excess sand to the Albany
Pine Bush Preserve Commission.
I. Road standards. Notwithstanding any other road construction
requirements promulgated by the Town of Colonie, the size of roads
built within conservation subdivisions may be reduced at the discretion
of the Planning Board and with approval of the Superintendent of
Highways.
J. Permanent open space. Open space set aside in a conservation
development shall be permanently preserved. The open space
protected pursuant to this article must have conservation value, which
shall be determined in the course of the conservation analysis
described above.
K. Preservation by permanent easement or deed restriction. [Amended
2-16-2012 by L.L. No. 3-2012]
(1) Where acceptable to the Town, a perpetual easement restricting
development of the open space land and allowing use only for
agriculture, forestry, passive recreation, protection of natural
resources or similar conservation purposes shall be granted to the
Town, with the approval of the Town Board, and/or to a qualified
not-for-profit conservation organization acceptable to the Planning
Board. Such easement shall be approved by the Planning Board and
required as a condition of final approval. The Planning Board shall
require that the easement be enforceable by the Town if the Town is
not the holder of the easement. The easement shall be recorded in
the County Clerk's Office.
(2) Where a perpetual easement is not acceptable to the Town, deed
restrictions restricting development of the open space land and
allowing use only for agriculture, forestry, passive recreation,
protection of natural resources or similar conservation purposes
§ 190-30 COLONIE CODE § 190-30
1:700
will be required as a condition of final approval. All deeds
containing such restrictions shall be recorded in the County Clerk's
Office.
(3) The easement or restriction shall prohibit residential, industrial or
commercial use of open space land (except in connection with
agriculture, forestry, and passive recreation) and shall not be
amendable to permit such use. Driveways, wells, underground
sewage disposal facilities, local utility distribution lines,
stormwater management facilities, trails and agricultural
structures shall be permitted on preserved open space land with
Planning Board approval, provided that they do not impair the
conservation value of the land. Forestry shall be conducted in
conformity with applicable best management practices as
described by the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation's Division of Lands and Forests.
(4) A land management plan, approved by the Planning Board, may be
required. The easement or restriction shall provide that if the Town
Board finds that the management plan has been violated in a
manner that renders the condition of the land a public nuisance,
the Town may, upon 30 days' written notice to the owner, enter the
premises for necessary maintenance and that the cost of such
maintenance by the Town shall be assessed against the landowner
or, in the case of a homeowners' association (HOA), the owners of
properties within the development and shall, if unpaid, become a
tax lien on such property or properties.
(5) Preserved open space may be included as a portion of one or more
large lots or may be contained in a separate open space lot. The
easement or restriction may allow dwellings to be constructed on
portions of lots that include preserved open space land, provided
that the total number of dwellings permitted by the easement or
restriction in the entire subdivision is consistent with applicable
density limitations.
L. Ownership of open space land. [Amended 2-16-2012 by L.L. No.
3-2012]
(1) Open space land may be owned by an HOA, offered for dedication
to Town, county or state governments, transferred to a not-forprofit
organization acceptable to the Planning Board, held in
private ownership or held in such other form of ownership as the
Planning Board finds appropriate to properly manage the open
space land and to protect its conservation value.
(2) If the land is owned by an HOA, such HOA shall be established in
accordance with the following:
(a) The HOA application must be submitted to the New York State
Attorney General's Office before the approved subdivision final
§ 190-30 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-30
1:701
plan is signed and must comply with all applicable provisions
of New York State law. The HOA must be approved by the New
York State Attorney General's Office prior to issuance of the
first building permit.
(b) Membership must be mandatory for each lot owner, who must
be required by recorded covenants and restrictions to pay fees
to the HOA for taxes, insurance, and maintenance of common
open space, private roads, and other common facilities.
(c) The HOA must be responsible for liability insurance and
property taxes for common lands, and the maintenance of
recreational facilities, private roads, driveways and parking
areas, and other common facilities.
(d) Property owners must be required to pay their prorated share
of the costs, and the assessment levied by the HOA must be
able to become a lien on the individual homeowners'
properties.
(e) The HOA must be able to adjust the assessment to meet
changed needs.
(f) The applicant shall make a conditional offer of dedication to
the Town binding upon the HOA for all open space intended to
be conveyed to the HOA. The filing in the County Clerk's Office
of a subdivision map depicting such open space shall be
considered an offer of dedication. Such offer may be accepted
by the Town, at the discretion of the Town Board, upon the
failure of the HOA to take title to the open space from the
applicant or other current owner, upon dissolution of the
association at any future time or upon failure of the HOA to
fulfill its maintenance obligations hereunder or to pay its real
property taxes.
(g) Ownership shall be structured in such a manner that real
property taxing authorities can satisfy property tax claims
against the open space lands by proceeding against individual
owners in the HOA and the dwelling units each owns.
(h) The Town Attorney's Office shall find that the HOA documents
presented satisfy the conditions above and such other
conditions as the Planning Board shall deem necessary.
M. Conservation development procedures. The conservation development
shall follow the same site plan and/or subdivision process contained in
this chapter, subject to the additional provisions contained herein.

10-2007; 5-21-2009 by L.L. No. 4-2009]
A. Determination of nonconforming use. Any lawfully established use of
property legally existing at the time of the passage of this chapter that
does not conform to the regulations thereof, except those established
pursuant to the issuance of a use variance, shall be deemed a
nonconforming use.
B. Continuation. Any nonconforming use which existed lawfully at the time
of adoption of this chapter may be continued, subject to the following
provisions.
(1) Extension, modification or replacement.
(a) Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or
extended beyond the area occupied by such use. No structure
occupied by or accessory to such use shall be constructed,
enlarged or extended, except for the following:
[1] A storage shed or garage that is clearly accessory and
incidental to the nonconforming use;
[2] An existing telecommunications tower where additional
antennas and/or equipment cabinets and cables are added
without increasing the height of the tower.
(b) Replacement. If a nonconforming use is modified or replaced in
whole or in part by another use, such use shall conform to this
chapter.
[1] Any nonconforming use undergoing a change of use which
does not comply with section § 190-20C of this chapter but
has a setback of at least 25 feet from the boundary of any
Single Family Residential or Multifamily Residential
Zoning District is prohibited unless a special use permit is
obtained as set forth in § 190-57. [Added 5-1-2014 by
L.L. No. 8-2014]
(c) In an OR, NCOR, COR or HCOR District where a mixed-use site
is not in conformance with respect to the required proportion
of commercial to residential use, an existing commercial use
may be replaced with a permitted commercial use, provided no
other violations of this chapter are created by such
replacement.
(2) Discontinuance. A nonconforming use shall not be changed unless
changed to a permitted use. A nonconforming use, if changed to a
permitted use, may not thereafter be changed back to a
§ 190-34 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-34
1:705
§ 190-35. Nonconforming structures. [Amended 5-21-2009 by L.L.
No. 4-2009]
nonpermitted use. When a nonconforming use has been
discontinued for a period of 18 months or more, intent to abandon
or relinquish such nonconforming use shall be presumed, and such
nonconforming use shall be deemed abandoned and shall not
thereafter be reestablished, and the use shall be changed to a
permitted use.
(3) Destruction and restoration. If any building or structure in which a
nonconforming use is conducted is hereafter removed or destroyed
through natural or other cause beyond the control of the owner, to
the extent that the loss is 75% or more of its fair market value at
the time of such damage, the use shall not be reinstated. If any
such building or structure is intentionally removed or destroyed to
any extent by its owner or agent thereof, the nonconforming use
shall not be reinstated.
A. Completion. Any building or structure for which construction was
lawfully begun prior to the adoption of this chapter may be completed
and used in accordance with the approved plans and specifications for
said building or structure.
B. Continuation. Any nonconforming building or structure which exists at
the time of the adoption of this chapter may be maintained so long as it
remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
(1) Modification and replacement.
(a) Modification.
[1] A nonconforming building or structure shall be maintained
in such condition as will not constitute a danger to the
health, safety or general welfare of the public.
[2] A nonconforming building or structure shall not be added
to, enlarged, reduced or altered in any manner which
increases its nonconformity, with the exception of existing
telecommunication towers as set forth in § 190-34
B(1)(a)[2]. Nothing herein, however, shall prevent the
strengthening or alteration to a safe condition of all or part
of a building that is nonconforming, provided that the
repair or alteration will not increase the nonconformity.
[3] A nonconforming building undergoing a change of use
which does not comply with § 190-20C of this chapter but
has a setback of at least 25 feet from the boundary of any
Single Family Residential or Multifamily Residential
Zoning District is prohibited unless a special use permit is
obtained as set forth in § 190-57 and the nonconforming
§ 190-34 COLONIE CODE § 190-35
1:706
§ 190-36. Changes in use of nonconforming lots.
No existing residential use established on a lot which does not conform to
the minimum area, width, frontage or building setback requirements as set
forth in this chapter for the zoning district in which the lot is located shall
be converted to any permitted nonresidential use, nor shall any existing
single-family residential use established on any such lot be converted to any
multifamily residential use.
§ 190-37. Certain uses deemed conforming.
A single-family dwelling, two-family dwelling, cemetery, greenhouse, public
utility plant, state, county or municipal building, airport, radio station,
religious institution or a club established pursuant to the New York State
Not-For-Profit Corporation Law or otherwise, and qualified as a tax-exempt
organization pursuant to 25 U.S.C.A. § 501(c)(7) and applicable regulations,
as the same may be amended from time to time, existing in any district at
the time of the passage of this chapter or any amendments thereto, shall be
deemed a conforming use upon the lot then devoted to such use, provided
that such use has been legally established, and the lot containing these uses
may not increase in size.
§ 190-38. Uses established by variance.
Any use established pursuant to a use variance issued prior to the date of
adoption of this chapter that does not conform to the regulations thereof
shall be permitted to continue, subject to any conditions of the variance
building maintains or exceeds its current setback. [Added
5-1-2014 by L.L. No. 8-2014]
(b) Replacement. A nonconforming structure may be replaced, to
occupy the same footprint on the lot and not exceeding the
height of the prior structure, or may be rebuilt providing
greater conformance to the dimensional requirements article
of this chapter,76 subject to a site plan review by the PEDD or
Planning Board, if applicable.
(2) Destruction and restoration. A nonconforming building or structure
destroyed or damaged through natural or other cause beyond the
control of its owner may be replaced, to occupy the same space on
the lot and not exceeding the height of the prior structure, or may
be rebuilt providing greater conformance to the dimensional
requirements article of this chapter,77 subject to a site plan review
by the PEDD or Planning Board, if applicable. A complete
application for building and zoning permit for the replacement

Design Standards
§ 190-40. Commercial Office Residential (COR).
Design and development standards for the Commercial Office Residential
District have been created to encourage coordinated parking and efficient
transportation connections between regional retailers, office development
and to provide safe circulation and enhanced aesthetics along primary
transportation corridors in the Town of Colonie. The following standards are
organized as four categories: site organization, site design, architectural
design, and multifamily residential element design. In general, the
standards reflect recommended or encouraged design elements that are
intended to promote the goals of the district and should be implemented to
the fullest extent practical. Where a standard includes the word "shall" or
"must," it is integral to the goals of the district and is mandatory. However,
the Planning Board may waive these standards to the extent it deems
necessary in order to secure a reasonable development of the site. In such
case, the applicant must establish that there are no practical alternatives to
the proposed waiver that would conform to the standard, and the Planning
Board shall issue a written finding stating the extent of and justification for
the waiver.
A. Site organization.
(1) Building placement.
(a) Buildings must present their main facade and entrance toward
the street. Buildings should be oriented parallel or
perpendicular to the street or public sidewalk and allow for
parking to the rear or side of the proposed structure.
(b) A minimum frontage build-out of 80% is recommended to
create a near continuous facade along the sidewalk. This
frontage may consist of a combination of the building and a
small landscape fencing made of wrought iron, common brick
or some other natural material. The intent is to create
continuous frontage to more clearly define a pedestrian
environment and an improved aesthetic setting.
(c) Maximum setback. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No.
10-2007]
[1] On a minor road, the maximum setback shall be 20 feet.
[2] On a major road, the maximum setback shall be 25 feet.
[3] On a through lot or corner lot, the maximum setback shall
apply only on one street, and major roads shall take
precedence.
§ 190-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-40
1:709
[4] On a lot containing more than one building, the maximum
setback requirement shall apply only to the building
located closest to the front lot line.
[5] On a lot containing an existing building, the maximum
setback requirement shall not be mandatory. However, any
new construction should comply with the intent of the
maximum setback provisions as far as is practical.
(2) On-street parking. On-street parking is encouraged where
appropriate, with bulb-outs of the sidewalk at the end of each block
to allow for easy pedestrian crossings.
(3) Off-street parking.
(a) Off-street parking is encouraged to be at the rear of the
building. Side of building parking is also permitted. New
parking in the front yard shall be prohibited. Further, drivethrough
access aisles and stacking spaces shall be prohibited
within the front yard.
(b) Off-street parking areas shall have landscaped buffers at least
15 feet in width between the parking area and edge of the
sidewalk or front lot line, whichever is closer, which includes
trees, hedges, shrubs and/or low walls consisting of wood,
brick, wrought iron or an acceptable substitute.
(c) Parking structures with active uses at street level are
encouraged. The sidewalk-level facades of garages shall be
designed to obscure the view of parked cars.
(d) For parking areas greater than 20 stalls, a minimum of 20
square feet of landscaped island shall be included in the
interior of the parking area for each stall. An island shall be
considered to be in the interior of the parking area if at least
75% of its perimeter abuts the parking area pavement.
[Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-200778; 8-28-2008 by
L.L. No. 8-2008]
(e) Landscaping requirements shall include the following
standards:
[1] Canopy/deciduous trees: 2.5 inches in caliper.
[2] Small flowering trees: two inches in caliper.
[3] Large shrubs: 30 inches in height.
(f) Shared accesspoints servicing adjoining parcels shall be
developed where appropriate to reduce curb cuts. A single

followed this section, and renumbered subsequent sections as necessary.
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-40
1:710
access to adjoining parking lots or an interconnection between
adjoining parking lots is encouraged and may be required
where necessary to provide safe traffic management. Cross
easements should be used to formalize shared access
arrangements between parcels.
(g) In no case shall parking be allowed on access roads.
(h) Peak period (spillover) parking areas with alternative pervious
paving materials are encouraged and could include grass
pavers and gravel surfaces.
(4) New streets.
(a) If new streets are developed, they shall create or continue an
interconnected network of streets laid out in walkable blocks.
Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets are strongly discouraged,
except where topography or natural features make these
necessary.
(b) Well-defined, ADA-compliant crosswalks, small turning radii at
intersections and other traffic-calming elements should be
incorporated.
(5) Green space. Within this district, the green space percentage is a
minimum of 35%. Refer to the incentive zoning provisions of this
chapter for green space "credits." Reduction in green space is
intended to be aesthetically balanced and accommodated through
quality and design of the open space. Green space should be
organized in a meaningful and useful manner and should include
one or more parks, squares or community greens where
appropriate.
B. Site design.
(1) Screening and buffering. Landscape buffers between residential
and commercial areas shall be used to lessen adverse impacts such
as noise, fumes, and privacy concerns. Acceptable screening
techniques include combinations of vegetated landscaping,
landscaping walls, fencing (excluding chain link), and earth
berming. When residential uses are adjacent to commercial uses,
additional screening treatments shall be required. Generally, the
buffer shall include a variety of local plant species, including a mix
of deciduous and evergreen trees. Parking, services, and loading/
maneuvering areas should be reasonably landscaped and screened
from view of adjacent properties and from within the project site.
(2) Site lighting.
(a) Pedestrian-scaled lighting and area lighting are required.
(b) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than
10 to 12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than
§ 190-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-40
1:711
the greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting
already on the premises, or the building height for the area
lighting. [Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]
(c) The light source shall not be visible from any angle from
adjacent streets or properties or the sky. Lights shall be
designed and installed so as not to cause illumination beyond
the boundaries of the site. Flashing or excessively bright
sources of illumination shall be prohibited.
(d) To provide optimum color rendition, lamps are preferred in the
following order: high-pressure sodium, metal halide, lowpressure
sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(3) Sidewalks.
(a) Sidewalks connecting residential areas with commercial areas
shall be constructed of concrete, brick, concrete pavers, stone
pavers, or stone slabs, and shall be five feet wide; sidewalks in
commercial areas should be a minimum of eight feet wide. A
minimum four-foot-wide landscaping buffer should be provided
between the sidewalk and street. The landscaping buffer shall
be planted with grass and include one large deciduous tree for
each 35 linear feet of road frontage, planted generally parallel
to the adjacent road. The purpose of the landscaping is to
provide enhanced pedestrian safety, help create definition
along the roadway and to provide shade. Where a planting
strip is not possible, street trees should be planted between the
curb and the building line. All street tree planting in paved
areas should be covered with a porous hard-surfaced grate.
Trees should not be planted closer than seven feet to the
building line. Tree species may include ash, elm, maple, oak, or
as approved by the PEDD or Planning Board. [Amended
8-28-2008 by L.L. No. 8-2008]
(b) Where a parking lot access drive crosses the sidewalk, the
concrete paving pattern of the sidewalk shall continue
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-40
1:712
uninterrupted. Where enhanced paving is used, the pattern
generally abuts asphalt. In these cases, a band of natural
concrete should be added as a protective edging between the
asphalt and the decorative paving.
(c) When the building is set back on the site, sidewalk connections
shall be provided from the public street sidewalk to the front of
the building.
(d) Sidewalks shall connect to adjoining properties and existing
sidewalks. Where sidewalks do not exist prior to the proposed
project, then the Planning Board shall refer to the
Comprehensive Plan to determine if sidewalks should be
included as a component of the proposed project. Bollards may
be incorporated at sidewalk road crossings.
(4) Sidewalk retail. Sidewalk retail may be permitted in limited
circumstances, subject to Planning Board approval. Merchandise
shall be removed at the daily close of business. There shall be a
minimum of five feet of clear distance or 50% of the sidewalk width,
whichever is greater, and in no case shall retail activity extend
beyond five feet into the sidewalk.
(5) Public spaces.
(a) Public spaces allow for residents and workers to meet
informally and socialize. Public space is strongly encouraged
and shall include landscaping and benches. Landscaping shall
include trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals. If public space is
constructed it should be constructed on the side of a building
which receives the most sunlight. Benches should be placed
under trees to provide shaded areas for people using the
§ 190-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-40
1:713
space. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete brick,
concrete and stone pavers, or stone slabs. Incorporation of
works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or entrance
lobbies is encouraged.
(b) Public plazas are strongly encouraged. Plazas are areas that
provide amenities such as seating, ornamental fountains,
lighting and landscaping for use by pedestrians. Incorporation
of works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or
entrance lobbies is encouraged. The area should be landscaped
with trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals, ornamental
lighting and benches. The area should be constructed on the
side of building that receives the most sunlight when possible.
Enhanced paving should be used to accent important places
outdoors: at entrances as a "welcome mat" and in spaces
where people congregate, pause or wait.
(6) Outdoor dining.
(a) Outdoor dining is a dining area of a designated size with
seating and/or tables located outdoors of a restaurant, coffee
shop or other food service establishment, which is located
entirely outside the walls of the subject building; enclosed on
two sides or fewer by the walls of the building with or without a
solid roof cover; or enclosed on three sides by the walls of the
building without a solid roof cover. The seating may be in
addition to the indoor seating or it may be the only seating
available for the restaurant. The outdoor dining area must be
visually and architecturally integrated with the building and
site pursuant to the design standards.
(b) Structures shall be consistent with existing state regulation for
safety. If at the side of a building, an edge matching the line of
the building facade should be created; the edge should be
made of transparent fence made of wood or wrought iron at a
maximum height of four feet. In no case should the fence/
railing combination prohibit views from the sidewalk into the
cafe area.
(c) The width of the public portion of the sidewalk adjacent to the
street shall not be constricted by the restaurant seating area.
There shall be a minimum of five feet of clear distance or 50%
of the sidewalk width, whichever is greater, in the public rightof-
way, free of all obstructions to allow adequate pedestrian
movement. The minimum distance shall be measured from the
line or nearest sidewalk obstruction adjacent to the curbline,
such as a public bench, garbage receptacle or utility pole.
Outdoor seating shall not be allowed if the minimum public
clearance distance is not met.
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-40
1:714
(d) Outdoor dining area furnishings shall consist solely of readily
removable umbrellas, covers, tables, chairs, planters
containing live plants, and decorative accessories. The number
and location of tables shall be compliant with the maximum
occupancy and aisle width standards for dining facilities set
forth in the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and
Building Code. No furnishing or other object may be attached,
even in a temporary manner, to the sidewalk or other public
property or to any building or structure. All furnishings shall
be removed from the sidewalk and stored indoors when the
establishment is closed.
(e) Outdoor dining areas, including the adjacent public right-ofway
along the building frontage, shall be kept free and clear at
all times of litter, debris, and any substance that may damage
the sidewalk or cause injury to a pedestrian. Failure to comply
will result in a violation of the conditions of approval.
(f) All foods and beverages shall be prepared within the
establishment in compliance with the terms and conditions of
any permit which may be required under any other law or
regulation for the serving of food and beverages, including
alcoholic beverage permits.
(7) Signage: refer to the signs and billboards article of this chapter.79
(8) Utilities: all utilities shall be placed underground.
(9) Stormwater management: Surface stormwater management basins
should not be placed within front yards. [Amended 6-28-2007 by
L.L. No. 10-2007]
C. Architectural design.
(1) Neighborhood compatibility. Buildings shall be compatible with or
improve upon the surrounding neighborhood and other commercial
districts. Compatibility shall be achieved through the use of similar
building massing, materials, scale, colors and other architectural
features. Larger buildings shall be permitted when designed to be
perceived as several buildings clustered together. It is the visual
connection that leads to the success of an area of development to
be recognized as a place with a character that distinguishes it from
other places. The following standards shall apply:
(a) Multiple-story buildings are strongly encouraged.
(b) First-story height should be a minimum of 12 feet measured
floor to floor.
79.Editor's Note: See Art. XV, Signs and Billboards.
§ 190-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-40
1:715
(2) Roof, pitched, hip (gable), gambrel or mansard roofs
recommended. Flat roofs should incorporate a parapet with cornice
details along facades facing public streets. Plain parapets are
discouraged. Pitched roofs should complement the overall style and
scale of the building. Materials for pitched roofs shall avoid having
a reflective finish. Colors should complement the overall character
of the building. Pitched roofs shall take measures to ensure that
falling snow, ice or rain do not create pedestrian hazards.
Roof examples
(3) Facade treatment and fenestration.
(a) The arrangement of building doors and windows helps to
communicate the nature of a building. Building fenestration
measures the amount of depth (such as a recessed entry) and
openings (such as window area) on a facade. Building
transparency is important at the street level, particularly for
retail establishments. Consequently, the ground floor of the
building shall provide the greatest amount of facade opening,
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-40
1:716
making it inviting to pedestrian traffic. The use of depth is
encouraged to highlight facade openings, such as windows.
Windows should not be mounted flush to the exterior of the
facade.
(b) Overall facade composition should break the building down
into smaller distinct portions to provide a small-scale
impression related to the pedestrian. Building transparency
and interior lighting is important at the street level;
consequently, ground floor level should have a minimum 50%
to 75% glass surface that is oriented vertically. Windows on the
first floor should be oriented vertically. Floor-to-ceiling
windows are strongly discouraged. Those on the second floor
shall relate to the first in shape, form and pattern. Upper floor
windows should make up at least 30% of the facade. Windows
should not be mounted flush to the exterior of the facade.
Storefront construction should be recessed enough at the point
of entry to allow the door to swing out without obstructing the
sidewalk. The architectural treatment of the front building
facade should be continued in its major features, around all
visible sides from the primary street. Blank, windowless walls
are strongly discouraged.
(4) Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies are not required
components of building design; however, their use is encouraged
on facades that face public streets. If awnings and canopies are
used, their coverings shall be made of canvas. Plastic-, metal- and
wood-covered awnings are not permissible. Internal lighting or
backlighting of awnings and canopies shall not be permitted. Color
schemes shall be consistent with the colors outlined under
materials and color below and shall be consistent with the overall
building color palette. Retractable awnings are permitted.
(5) Specialty equipment.
(a) Rooftop mechanical equipment, satellite dishes, antennas and
other equipment shall be screened from public view by the use
of architecturally compatible materials, parapets, sloped roof
form or walls that are at least as high as the equipment being
screened.
§ 190-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-40
1:717
Specialty equipment: rooftop
(b) Ground-level mechanical and service equipment (such as
dumpsters, loading docks, and utility boxes) shall be screened
from public view by landscaping, natural material walls and
opaque fencing, and/or other design treatments compatible
with the finishes of the principal structure.
Specialty equipment: ground level
(6) Materials and color.
(a) The quality of exterior materials shall be sufficiently durable to
guarantee low maintenance, stability and a reasonable life
span.
(b) Preferred facade materials:
[1] Common red brick.
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-40
1:718
[2] Architectural masonry units (colored, textured, painted).
[3] Natural stone, stone veneer or cast stone.
[4] Wood.
[5] Siding of high quality product simulating a natural
material.
(c) Strongly discouraged materials:
[1] Plain (bare) masonry units.
[2] Plain vinyl or metal siding.
[3] Imitation stone, plastic, composite or resin products.
(d) Trim materials:
[1] Finish-grade painted or stained wood.
[2] Bare, lumber grade wood is strongly discouraged.
[3] Windows should have anodized aluminum or wood frame,
not bare aluminum frame.
(e) Building colors. Colors should be chosen from a commercial
paint distributor's historic color palette, as approved by the
Planning Board. Fluorescent colors shall not be permitted.
D. Multifamily residential element design. Design and development
standards for stand-alone multifamily residential components in the
COR District have been created to develop housing in a way that
conserves the desirable characteristics of established neighborhoods,
while creating new livable neighborhoods that are well integrated into
the adjacent commercial areas.
(1) Site planning. New multifamily projects should be an integral part
of the neighborhood and the community and create a comfortable
and social living environment for residents.
(a) Buildings should frame neighborhood gateways and define
community and common open spaces.
(b) Public, communal, and private spaces should be clearly
distinguishable.
(c) Ground-floor units should have direct access from streets and
common spaces.

(h) Parking should be unobtrusive and not disrupt the quality of
common spaces and pedestrian environments of multifamily
development.
(i) Visible long and unbroken rows of parked cars or garage doors
should not be permitted. Garage door width facing the street
shall not exceed 50% of the width of the building. Parking
should be distributed throughout the site in courts and
garages. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007]
(j) In no event shall the garage extend beyond the habitable area
of the house.
(k) In the event of rear yard alleys, no setback from the lot line
along the alley shall be required for detached garages.
(l) Services for multifamily development should not be visible
from public areas. Trash bins, utility meters, transformers and
other service elements shall be enclosed or otherwise
concealed from view.
(2) Architectural design. The design of new multifamily projects should
demonstrate a commitment to lasting and durable design.
(a) Multifamily projects should utilize a unifying theme and
possess a common vocabulary of forms and architectural
elements.
(b) Building forms should be articulated by varying roof heights
and wall planes. Long unbroken volumes and large
unarticulated wall and roof planes shall not be permitted.
(c) Facades should have three-dimensional elements, such as
chimneys, balconies, bay windows or dormers, to break up
large wall and roof surfaces.
(d) Every facade should be well composed and articulated, with
consistent treatment on all facades.
(e) Stairways, fences, trash enclosures and other accessory
elements should be designed as integral parts of the
architecture. Manufactured components attached to the
outside of buildings, such as stairways and sheds, shall be
prohibited.
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-40
1:720
(f) Architecture within each multifamily project should use a
palette of materials which conveys an image of quality and
durability.
(g) All the facades should employ the same vocabulary of
materials.
(h) Painted surfaces should use colors that reinforce architectural
concepts and are compatible with natural materials, such as
brick or stone.
(3) Lighting: Lighting should be an integral part of the planning and
design of multifamily projects and not treated as an afterthought.
(a) Lighting in projects should be designed for specific tasks (i.e.,
illuminating common areas, parking, streets, paths and
entryways).
(b) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than
10 to 12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than
the greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting
already on the premises, or the building height for the area
lighting. [Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]
(c) To provide optimum color rendition, lamps are preferred in the
following order: high-pressure sodium, metal halide, lowpressure
sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(d) Fixtures and posts should be consistent throughout the project.
(e) Fixtures should incorporate cutoffs to screen the view of light
sources from residences.
(4) Landscaping: Landscaping for multifamily projects should
integrate the projects with the neighborhood and coherently
support site and architectural concepts.
(a) All site areas not covered by structures, walkways, driveways
or parking spaces should be landscaped.
(b) Landscaping should support the distinction and transition
between private, common and public spaces.
(c) Landscape materials should be live plants.
(d) Natural features and existing trees should be incorporated into
the landscape plan.
(e) Plazas and common areas subject to pedestrian traffic may be
surfaced with a combination of landscape and decorative
pavers or textured concrete.
§ 190-40 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-40
1:721
§ 190-41. Highway Commercial Office Residential (HCOR).
Design and development standards for the Highway Commercial Office
Residential (HCOR) have been created to facilitate pedestrian connections
between the commercial areas as well as with adjoining neighborhoods
while providing improved vehicle circulation and safety and enhanced
aesthetics. The following policies are organized in four categories: site
organization, site design, architectural design, and multifamily residential
element design. In general, the standards reflect recommended or
encouraged design elements that are intended to promote the goals of
the district and should be implemented to the fullest extent practical.
Where a standard includes the word "shall" or "must," it is integral to the
goals of the district and is mandatory. However, the Planning Board may
waive these standards to the extent it deems necessary in order to secure
a reasonable development of the site. In such case, the applicant must
establish that there are no practical alternatives to the proposed waiver that
would conform to the standard, and the Planning Board shall issue a written
finding stating the extent of and justification for the waiver.
(f) Parking lots should be generously landscaped to provide
shade, reduce glare and provide visual interest.
(g) At least 15% of shared parking lots shall be landscaped. Lots
shall be screened from view with architectural walls, berms or
shrubs.
A. Site organization.
(1) Building placement.
(a) Buildings must present their main facade and entrance toward
the street. Buildings should be oriented parallel or
perpendicular to the public sidewalk and allow for parking in
the rear or side of the proposed structure.
(b) A minimum frontage build-out of 80% is recommended to
create a near-continuous facade along the sidewalk. This
frontage may consist of a combination of the building and a
small landscape fencing made of wrought iron, common brick
or some other natural material. The intent is to create
continuous frontage to more clearly define a pedestrian
environment and an improved aesthetic setting.
(c) Maximum setback. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No.
10-2007]
[1] On a minor road, the maximum setback shall be 20 feet.
[2] On a major road, the maximum setback shall be 25 feet.
§ 190-40 COLONIE CODE § 190-41
1:722
[3] On a through lot or corner lot, the maximum setback shall
apply only on one street, and major roads shall take
precedence.
[4] On a lot containing more than one building, the maximum
setback requirement shall apply only to the building
located closest to the front lot line.
[5] On a lot containing an existing building, the maximum
setback requirement shall not be mandatory. However, any
new construction should comply with the intent of the
maximum setback provisions as far as is practical.
(2) On-street parking. On-street parking is encouraged where
appropriate, with bulb-outs of the sidewalk at the end of each block
to allow for easy pedestrian crossings.
(3) Off-street parking.
(a) Off-street parking is encouraged to be at the rear of the
building. Side-of-building parking is also permitted. New
parking in the front yard shall be prohibited. Further, drivethrough
access aisles and stacking spaces shall be prohibited
within the front yard.
(b) Off-street parking areas shall have landscaped buffers at least
15 feet in width between the parking area and edge of the
sidewalk or front lot line, whichever is closer, which includes
trees, hedges, shrubs and/or low walls consisting of wood,
brick, wrought iron or an acceptable substitute.
(c) Parking structures with active uses at street level are
encouraged. The sidewalk-level facades of garages shall be
designed to obscure the view of parked cars.
(d) For parking areas greater than 20 stalls, a minimum of 20
square feet of landscaped island shall be included in the
interior of the parking area for each stall. An island shall be
considered to be in the interior of the parking area if at least
75% of its perimeter abuts the parking area pavement.
[Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-200780; 8-28-2008 by
L.L. No. 8-2008]
(e) Landscaping requirements shall include the following
standards:
[1] Canopy/deciduous trees: 2.5 inches in caliper.
[2] Small flowering trees: two inches in caliper.

followed this section, and renumbered subsequent sections as necessary.
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-41
1:723
[3] Large shrubs: 30 inches in height.
(f) Shared access points servicing adjoining parcels shall be
developed where appropriate to reduce curb cuts. A single
access to adjoining parking lots or an interconnection between
adjoining parking lots is encouraged and may be required
where necessary to provide safe traffic management. Cross
easements should be used to formalize shared access
arrangements between parcels.
(g) In no case shall parking be allowed on access roads.
(h) Peak period (spillover) parking areas with alternative pervious
paving materials are encouraged and could include grass
pavers and gravel surfaces.
(4) New streets.
(a) If new streets are developed, they shall create or continue an
interconnected network of streets laid out in walkable blocks.
Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets are strongly discouraged,
except where topography or natural features make these
necessary.
(b) Well-defined, ADA-compliant crosswalks, small turning radii at
intersections and other traffic-calming elements should be
incorporated.
(5) Green space. Within this district, the green space percentage is a
minimum of 35%. Refer to the incentive zoning provisions of this
chapter for green space "credits." Reduction in green space is
intended to be aesthetically balanced and accommodated through
quality and design of the open space. Green space should be
organized in a meaningful and useful manner and should include
one or more parks, squares or community greens where
appropriate.
B. Site design.
(1) Screening and buffering. Landscape buffers between residential
and commercial areas shall be used to lessen adverse impacts such
as noise, fumes and privacy concerns. Acceptable screening
techniques include combinations of vegetated landscaping,
landscaping walls, fencing (excluding chain link) and earth
berming. When residential uses are adjacent to commercial uses,
additional screening treatments shall be required. Generally, the

sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(3) Sidewalks.
(a) Sidewalks connecting residential areas with commercial areas
shall be constructed of concrete, brick, concrete pavers, stone
pavers, or stone slabs, and shall be five feet wide; sidewalks in
commercial areas should be a minimum of eight feet wide. A
minimum four-foot-wide landscaping buffer should be provided
between the sidewalk and street. The landscaping buffer shall
be planted with grass and include one large deciduous tree for
each 35 linear feet of road frontage, planted generally parallel
to the adjacent road. The purpose of the landscaping is to
provide enhanced pedestrian safety, help create definition
along the roadway and to provide shade. Where a planting
strip is not possible, street trees should be planted between the
curb and the building line. All street tree planting in paved
areas should be covered with a porous hard-surfaced grate.
Trees should not be planted closer than seven feet to the
building line. Tree species may include ash, elm, maple, oak, or
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-41
1:725
as approved by the PEDD or Planning Board. [Amended
8-28-2008 by L.L. No. 8-2008]
(b) Where a parking lot access drive crosses the sidewalk, the
concrete paving pattern of the sidewalk shall continue

Comprehensive Plan to determine if sidewalks should be
included as a component of the proposed project. Bollards may
be incorporated at sidewalk road crossings.
(4) Sidewalk retail: Sidewalk retail may be permitted in limited
circumstances, subject to Planning Board approval. Merchandise
shall be removed at the daily close of business. There shall be a
minimum of five feet of clear distance or 50% of the sidewalk width,
whichever is greater, and in no case shall retail activity extend
beyond five feet into the sidewalk.
(5) Public spaces.
(a) Public spaces allow for residents and workers to meet
informally and socialize. Public space is strongly encouraged
§ 190-41 COLONIE CODE § 190-41
1:726
and shall include landscaping and benches. Landscaping shall
include trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals. If public space
is constructed it should be constructed on the side of a building
which receives the most sunlight. Benches should be placed
under trees to provide shaded areas for people using the
space. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete brick,
concrete and stone pavers, or stone slabs. Incorporation of
works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or entrance
lobbies is encouraged.
(b) Public plazas are strongly encouraged. Plazas are areas that
provide amenities such as seating, ornamental fountains,
lighting, and landscaping for use by pedestrians. Incorporation
of works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or
entrance lobbies is encouraged. Area should be landscaped
with trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals, ornamental
lighting, and benches. Area should be constructed on the side
of building that receives the most sunlight when possible.
Enhanced paving should be used to accent important places
outdoors: at entrances as a "welcome mat" and in spaces
where people congregate, pause or wait.
(6) Outdoor dining.
(a) Outdoor dining is a dining area of a designated size with
seating and/or tables located outdoors of a restaurant, coffee
shop or other food service establishment, which is located
entirely outside the walls of the subject building; enclosed on
two sides or fewer by the walls of the building with or without a
solid roof cover; or enclosed on three sides by the walls of the
building without a solid roof cover. The seating may be in
addition to the indoor seating or it may be the only seating
available for the restaurant. The outdoor dining area must be
visually and architecturally integrated with the building and
site pursuant to the design standards.
(b) Structures shall be consistent with existing state regulation for
safety. If at the side of a building, an edge matching the line of
the building facade should be created; the edge should be
made of transparent fence made of wood or wrought iron at a
maximum height of four feet. In no case should the fence/
railing combination prohibit views from the sidewalk into the
cafe area.
(c) The width of the public portion of the sidewalk adjacent to the
street shall not be constricted by the restaurant seating area.
There shall be a minimum of five feet of clear distance or 50%
of the sidewalk width, whichever is greater, in the public rightof-
way, free of all obstructions to allow adequate pedestrian
movement. The minimum distance shall be measured from the
line or nearest sidewalk obstruction adjacent to the curbline,
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-41
1:727
such as a public bench, garbage receptacle or utility pole.
Outdoor seating shall not be allowed if the minimum public
clearance distance is not met.
(d) Outdoor dining area furnishings shall consist solely of readily
removable umbrellas, covers, tables, chairs, planters
containing live plants, and decorative accessories. The number
and location of tables shall be compliant with the maximum
occupancy and aisle width standards for dining facilities set
forth in the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and
Building Code. No furnishing or other object may be attached,
even in a temporary manner, to the sidewalk or other public
property or to any building or structure. All furnishings shall
be removed from the sidewalk and stored indoors when the
establishment is closed.
(e) Outdoor dining areas, including the adjacent public right-ofway
along the building frontage, shall be kept free and clear at
all times of litter, debris, and any substance that may damage
the sidewalk or cause injury to a pedestrian. Failure to comply
will result in a violation of the conditions of approval.
(f) All foods and beverages shall be prepared within the
establishment in compliance with the terms and conditions of
any permit which may be required under any other law or
regulation for the serving of food and beverages, including
alcoholic beverage permits.
(7) Signage: refer to the signs and billboards article of this chapter.81
(8) Utilities: all utilities shall be placed underground.
(9) Stormwater management: Surface stormwater management basins
should not be placed within front yards. [Amended 6-28-2007 by
L.L. No. 10-2007]
C. Architectural design.
(1) Neighborhood compatibility. Buildings shall be compatible with or
improve upon the surrounding neighborhood and other commercial
districts. Compatibility shall be achieved through the use of similar
building massing, materials, scale, colors and other architectural
features. Larger buildings shall be permitted when designed to be
perceived as several buildings clustered together. It is the visual
connection that leads to the success of an area of development to
be recognized as a place with a character that distinguishes it from
other places. The following standards shall apply:
(a) Multiple-story buildings are strongly encouraged.
81.Editor's Note: See Art. XV, Signs and Billboards.
§ 190-41 COLONIE CODE § 190-41
1:728
(b) First-story height should be a minimum of 12 feet measured
floor to floor.
(2) Roof. Pitched hip (gable), flat, gambrel or mansard roof are
recommended. Flat roofs shall incorporate a parapet along facades
facing any public street, including architectural cornice detailing.
Plain parapets shall not be permitted. Pitched roofs shall
complement the overall style and scale of the building. Materials
for pitched roofs shall avoid having a reflective finish and
incorporate a color that complements the overall character of the
building. Pitched roofs shall take measures to ensure that falling
snow, ice or rain do not create pedestrian hazards.
Roof examples
(3) Facade treatment and fenestration. The arrangement of building
doors and windows helps to communicate the nature of a building.
Building fenestration measures the amount of depth (such as a
recessed entry) and openings (such as window area) on a facade.
Building transparency is important at the street level, particularly
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-41
1:729
for retail establishments. Consequently, the ground floor of the
building shall provide the greatest amount of facade opening,
making it inviting to pedestrian traffic. The use of depth is
encouraged to highlight facade openings such as windows.
Windows shall not be mounted flush to the exterior of the facade.
(4) Overall facade composition should break the building down into
smaller distinct portions to provide a small-scale impression
related to the pedestrian. Building transparency and interior
lighting is important at the street level; consequently, ground floor
level should have a minimum 50% to 75% glass surface that is
oriented vertically. Windows on the first floor should be oriented
vertically. Floor-to-ceiling windows are strongly discouraged. Those
on the second floor shall relate to the first in shape, form and
pattern. Upper-floor windows should make up at least 30% of the
facade. Windows should not be mounted flush to the exterior of the
facade. Storefront construction should be recessed enough at the
point of entry to allow the door to swing out without obstructing the
sidewalk. The architectural treatment of the front building facade
should be continued in its major features, around all visible sides
from the primary street. Blank, windowless walls are strongly
discouraged.
(5) Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies are not required
components of building design, however, their use is encouraged
on facades that face public streets. If awnings and canopies are
used, their coverings shall be made of canvas. Plastic-, metal- and
wood-covered awnings are not permissible. Internal lighting or
backlighting of awnings and canopies shall not be permitted. Color
schemes shall be consistent with the colors outlined under
materials and color below and shall be consistent with the overall
building color palette. Retractable awnings are permitted.
(6) Specialty equipment.
(a) Rooftop mechanical equipment, satellite dishes, antennas and
other equipment shall be screened from public view by the use
of architecturally compatible materials, which shall be integral
to the overall building design.
§ 190-41 COLONIE CODE § 190-41
1:730
Specialty equipment: rooftop
(b) Ground-level mechanical and service equipment (such as airconditioning
equipment, and utility boxes) shall be screened
from public view by landscaping, natural material walls and
fencing or other design treatments compatible with the
finishes of the principal structure.
Specialty equipment: ground level
(7) Materials and color.
(a) The quality of exterior materials shall be sufficiently durable to
guarantee low maintenance, stability and a reasonable life
span.
(b) Preferred facade materials:
[1] Common red brick.
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-41
1:731
[2] Architectural masonry units (colored, textured, painted).
[3] Natural stone, stone veneer or cast stone.
[4] Wood.
[5] Siding of high quality product simulating a natural
material.
(c) Strongly discouraged materials:
[1] Plain (bare) masonry units.
[2] Plain vinyl or metal siding.
[3] Imitation stone, plastic, composite or resin products.
(d) Trim materials:
[1] Finish-grade painted or stained wood.
[2] Bare, lumber grade wood is strongly discouraged.
[3] Windows should have anodized aluminum or wood frame,
not bare aluminum frame.
(e) Building colors. Colors should be chosen from a commercial
paint distributor's historic color palette, as approved by the
Planning Board. Fluorescent colors shall not be permitted.
D. Multifamily residential element design. Design and development
standards for stand-alone multifamily residential components in the
HCOR District have been created to develop housing in a way that
conserves the desirable characteristics of established neighborhoods,
while creating new livable neighborhoods that are well integrated into
the adjacent commercial areas.
(1) Site planning. New multifamily projects should be an integral part
of the neighborhood and the community and create a comfortable
and social living environment for residents.
(a) Buildings should frame neighborhood gateways and define
community and common open spaces.
(b) Public, communal and private spaces should be clearly
distinguishable.
(c) Ground-floor units should have direct access from streets and
common spaces.
(d) Units should provide "eyes-on-the street" security by orienting
towards streets and common areas.
(e) Site entries should distinguish themselves with added texture
or use of contrasting materials.
§ 190-41 COLONIE CODE § 190-41
1:732
(f) Entry drives to multifamily housing should be designed to
create a positive identity for the project. Landscape and site
design should frame and distinguish entry drives.
(g) Parking shall be screened by landscaping or buildings.
(h) Parking should be unobtrusive and not disrupt the quality of
common spaces and pedestrian environments of multifamily
development.
(i) Visible long and unbroken rows of parked cars or garage doors
should not be permitted. Garage door width facing the street
shall not exceed 50% of the width of the building. Parking
should be distributed throughout the site in courts and
garages. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007]
(j) In no event shall the garage extend beyond the habitable area
of the house.
(k) In the event of rear yard alleys, no setback from the lot line
along the alley shall be required for detached garages.
(l) Services for multifamily development should not be visible
from public areas. Trash bins, utility meters, transformers and
other service elements shall be enclosed or otherwise
concealed from view.
(2) Architectural design. The design of new multifamily projects should
demonstrate a commitment to lasting and durable design.
(a) Multifamily projects should utilize a unifying theme and
possess a common vocabulary of forms and architectural
elements.
(b) Building forms should be articulated by varying roof heights
and wall planes. Long, unbroken volumes and large,
unarticulated wall and roof planes shall not be permitted.
(c) Facades should have three-dimensional elements, such as
chimneys, balconies, bay windows or dormers, to break up
large wall and roof surfaces.
(d) Every facade should be well composed and articulated, with
consistent treatment on all facades.
(e) Stairways, fences, trash enclosures and other accessory
elements should be designed as integral parts of the
architecture. Manufactured components attached to the
outside of buildings, such as stairways and sheds, shall be
prohibited.
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-41
1:733
(f) Architecture within each multifamily project should use a
palette of materials which conveys an image of quality and
durability.
(g) All the facades should employ the same vocabulary of
materials.
(h) Painted surfaces should use colors that reinforce architectural
concepts and are compatible with natural materials, such as
brick or stone.
(3) Lighting. Lighting should be an integral part of the planning and
design of multifamily projects and not treated as an afterthought.
(a) Lighting in projects should be designed for specific tasks (i.e.,
illuminating common areas, parking, streets, paths and
entryways).
(b) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than
10 to 12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than
the greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting
already on the premises, or the building height for the area
lighting. [Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]
(c) To provide optimum color rendition, lamps are preferred in the
following order: high-pressure sodium, metal halide, lowpressure
sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(d) Fixtures and posts should be consistent throughout the project.
(e) Fixtures should incorporate cutoffs to screen the view of light
sources from residences.
(4) Landscaping. Landscaping for multifamily projects should
integrate the projects with the neighborhood and coherently
support site and architectural concepts.
(a) All site areas not covered by structures, walkways, driveways
or parking spaces should be landscaped.
(b) Landscaping should support the distinction and transition
between private, common and public spaces.
(c) Landscape materials should be live plants.
(d) Natural features and existing trees should be incorporated into
the landscape plan.
(e) Plazas and common areas subject to pedestrian traffic may be
surfaced with a combination of landscape and decorative
pavers or textured concrete.
§ 190-41 COLONIE CODE § 190-41
1:734
§ 190-42. Neighborhood Commercial Office Residential (NCOR).
Design and development standards for the Neighborhood Commercial
Office Residential (NCOR) have been created to enhance the image and
quality of the Town's small-scale commercial areas by encouraging mixeduse
development in a coordinated manner with strong pedestrian elements
and to reinforce distinct neighborhood identities through a mixture of retail
establishments, commercial services, office development and public spaces.
The district should possess strong pedestrian linkages to the surrounding
residential neighborhoods. The following standards are organized as four
categories: site organization, site design, architectural design, and
multifamily residential element design. In general, the standards reflect
recommended or encouraged design elements that are intended to promote
the goals of the district and should be implemented to the fullest extent
practical. Where a standard includes the word "shall" or "must," it is
integral to the goals of the district and is mandatory. However, the Planning
Board may waive these standards to the extent it deems necessary in order
to secure a reasonable development of the site. In such case, the applicant
must establish that there are no practical alternatives to the proposed
waiver that would conform to the standard, and the Planning Board shall
issue a written finding stating the extent of and justification for the waiver.
(f) Parking lots should be generously landscaped to provide
shade, reduce glare and provide visual interest.
(g) At least 15% of shared parking lots shall be landscaped. Lots
shall be screened from view with architectural walls, berms or
shrubs.
A. Site organization.
(1) Building placement.
(a) Buildings must present their main facade and entrance toward
the street. Buildings should be oriented parallel or
perpendicular to the public sidewalk and allow for parking in
the rear or side of the proposed structure.
(b) A minimum frontage build-out of 80% is recommended to
create a near-continuous facade along the sidewalk. This
frontage may consist of a combination of the building and a
small landscape fencing made of wrought iron, common brick
or some other natural material. The intent is to create
continuous frontage to more clearly define a pedestrian
environment and an improved aesthetic setting.
(c) Maximum setback. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No.
10-2007]
[1] On a minor road, the maximum setback shall be 20 feet.
[2] On a major road, the maximum setback shall be 25 feet.
§ 190-41 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-42
1:735
[3] On a through lot or corner lot, the maximum setback shall
apply only on one street, and major roads shall take
precedence.
[4] On a lot containing more than one building, the maximum
setback requirement shall apply only to the building
located closest to the front lot line.
[5] On a lot containing an existing building, the maximum
setback requirement shall not be mandatory. However, any
new construction should comply with the intent of the
maximum setback provisions as far as is practical.
(2) On-street parking. On-street parking is encouraged where
appropriate, with bulb-outs of the sidewalk at the end of each block
to allow for easy pedestrian crossings.
(3) Off-street parking.
(a) Off-street parking is encouraged to be at the rear of the
building. Side-of-building parking is also permitted. New
parking in the front yard shall be prohibited. [Amended
6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007]
(b) Off street parking areas shall have landscaped buffers at least
15 feet in width between the parking area and edge of the
sidewalk or front lot line, whichever is closer, which includes
trees, hedges, shrubs and/or low walls consisting of wood,
brick, wrought iron or an acceptable substitute.
(c) Parking structures with active uses at street level are
encouraged. The sidewalk-level facades of garages shall be
designed to obscure the view of parked cars.
(d) For parking areas greater than 20 stalls, a minimum of 20
square feet of landscaped island shall be included in the
interior of the parking area for each stall. An island shall be
considered to be in the interior of the parking area if at least
75% of its perimeter abuts the parking area pavement.
[Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-200782; 8-28-2008 by
L.L. No. 8-2008]
(e) Landscaping requirements shall include the following
standards:
[1] Canopy/deciduous trees: 2.5 inches in caliper.
[2] Small flowering trees: two inches in caliper.
[3] Large shrubs: 30 inches in height.
82.Editor's Note: This ordinance also repealed former Subsection A(3)(e), which immediately
followed this section, and renumbered subsequent sections as necessary.
§ 190-42 COLONIE CODE § 190-42
1:736
(f) Shared access points servicing adjoining parcels shall be
developed where appropriate to reduce curb cuts. A single
access to adjoining parking lots or an interconnection between
adjoining parking lots is encouraged and may be required
where necessary to provide safe traffic management. Cross
easements should be used to formalize shared access
arrangements between parcels.
(g) In no case shall parking be allowed on access roads.
(h) Peak period (spillover) parking areas with alternative pervious
paving materials are encouraged and could include grass
pavers and gravel surfaces.
(4) New streets.
(a) If new streets are developed, they shall create or continue an
interconnected network of streets laid out in walkable blocks.
Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets are strongly discouraged,
except where topography or natural features make these
necessary.
(b) Well-defined, ADA-compliant crosswalks, small turning radii at
intersections and other traffic-calming elements should be
incorporated.
(5) Green space. Within this district, the green space percentage is a
minimum of 35%. Refer to the incentive zoning provisions of this
chapter for green space "credits." Reduction in green space is
intended to be aesthetically balanced and accommodated through
quality and design of the open space. Green space should be
organized in a meaningful and useful manner and should include
one or more parks, squares or community greens where
appropriate.
B. Site design.
(1) Screening and buffering. Landscape buffers between residential
and commercial areas shall be used to lessen adverse impacts such
as noise, fumes and privacy concerns. Acceptable screening
techniques include combinations of vegetated landscaping,
landscaping walls, fencing (excluding chain link), and earth
berming. When residential uses are adjacent to commercial uses,
additional screening treatments shall be required. Generally, the
buffer shall include a variety of local plant species, including a mix
of deciduous and evergreen trees. Parking, services, and loading/
maneuvering areas should be reasonably landscaped and screened
from view of adjacent properties and from within the project site.
(2) Site lighting.
(a) Pedestrian-scaled lighting and area lighting are required.
§ 190-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-42
1:737
(b) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than
10 to 12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than
the greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting
already on the premises, or the building height for the area
lighting. [Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]
(c) The light source shall not be visible from any angle from
adjacent streets or properties or the sky. Lights shall be
designed and installed so as not to cause illumination beyond
the boundaries of the site. Flashing or excessively bright
sources of illumination shall be prohibited.
(d) To provide optimum color rendition, lamps are preferred in the
following order: high-pressure sodium, metal halide, lowpressure
sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(3) Sidewalks.
(a) Sidewalks connecting residential areas with commercial areas
shall be constructed of concrete, brick, concrete pavers, stone
pavers, or stone slabs, and shall be five feet wide; sidewalks in
commercial areas should be a minimum of eight feet wide. A
minimum four-foot-wide landscaping buffer should be provided
between the sidewalk and street. The landscaping buffer shall
be planted with grass and include one large deciduous tree for
each 35 linear feet of road frontage, planted generally parallel
to the adjacent road. The purpose of the landscaping is to
provide enhanced pedestrian safety, help create definition
along the roadway and to provide shade. Where a planting
strip is not possible, street trees should be planted between the
curb and the building line. All street tree planting in paved
areas should be covered with a porous hard-surfaced grate.
Trees should not be planted closer than seven feet to the
building line. Tree species may include ash, elm, maple, oak, or
as approved by the PEDD or Planning Board. [Amended
8-28-2008 by L.L. No. 8-2008]
§ 190-42 COLONIE CODE § 190-42
1:738
(b) Where a parking lot access drive crosses the sidewalk, the
concrete paving pattern of the sidewalk shall continue
uninterrupted. Where enhanced paving is used, the pattern
generally abuts asphalt. In these cases, a band of natural
concrete should be added as a protective edging between the
asphalt and the decorative paving.
(c) When the building is set back on the site, sidewalk connections
shall be provided from the public street sidewalk to the front of
the building.
(d) Sidewalks shall connect to adjoining properties and existing
sidewalks. Where sidewalks do not exist prior to the proposed
project, then the Planning Board shall refer to the
Comprehensive Plan to determine if sidewalks should be
included as a component of the proposed project. Bollards may
be incorporated at sidewalk road crossings.
(4) Public spaces.
(a) Public spaces allow for residents and workers to meet
informally and socialize. Public space is strongly encouraged
and shall include landscaping and benches. Landscaping shall
include trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals. If public space is
constructed it should be constructed on the side of a building
which receives the most sunlight. Benches should be placed
under trees to provide shaded areas for people using the
space. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete, brick,
concrete and stone pavers, or stone slabs. Incorporation of
works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or entrance
lobbies is encouraged.
§ 190-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-42
1:739
(b) Public plazas are strongly encouraged. Plazas are areas that
provide amenities such as seating, ornamental fountains,
lighting and landscaping for use by pedestrians. Incorporation
of works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or
entrance lobbies is encouraged. Area should be landscaped
with trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals, ornamental
lighting, and benches. Area should be constructed on side of
building that receives the most sunlight when possible.
Enhanced paving should be used to accent important places
outdoors: at entrances as a "welcome mat" and in spaces
where people congregate, pause or wait.
(5) Outdoor dining.
(a) Outdoor dining is a dining area of a designated size with
seating and/or tables located outdoors of a restaurant, coffee
shop or other food service establishment, which is located
entirely outside the walls of the subject building; enclosed on
two sides or fewer by the walls of the building with or without a
solid roof cover; or enclosed on three sides by the walls of the
building without a solid roof cover. The seating may be in
addition to the indoor seating or it may be the only seating
available for the restaurant. The outdoor dining area must be
visually and architecturally integrated with the building and
site pursuant to the design standards.
(b) Structures shall be consistent with existing state regulation for
safety. If at the side of a building, an edge matching the line of
the building facade should be created; the edge should be
made of transparent fence made of wood or wrought iron at a
maximum height of four feet. In no case should the fence/
railing combination prohibit views from the sidewalk into the
cafe area.
(c) The width of the public portion of the sidewalk adjacent to the
street shall not be constricted by the restaurant seating area.
There shall be a minimum of five feet of clear distance or 50%
of the sidewalk width, whichever is greater, in the public rightof-
way, free of all obstructions to allow adequate pedestrian
movement. The minimum distance shall be measured from the
line or nearest sidewalk obstruction adjacent to the curbline,
such as a public bench, garbage receptacle or utility pole.
Outdoor seating shall not be allowed if the minimum public
clearance distance is not met.
(d) Outdoor dining area furnishings shall consist solely of readily
removable umbrellas, covers, tables, chairs, planters
containing live plants, and decorative accessories. The number
and location of tables shall be compliant with the maximum
occupancy and aisle width standards for dining facilities set
forth in the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and
§ 190-42 COLONIE CODE § 190-42
1:740
Building Code. No furnishing or other object may be attached,
even in a temporary manner, to the sidewalk or other public
property or to any building or structure. All furnishings shall
be removed from the sidewalk and stored indoors when the
establishment is closed.
(e) Outdoor dining areas, including the adjacent public right-ofway
along the building frontage, shall be kept free and clear at
all times of litter, debris, and any substance that may damage
the sidewalk or cause injury to a pedestrian. Failure to comply
will result in a violation of the conditions of approval.
(f) All foods and beverages shall be prepared within the
establishment in compliance with the terms and conditions of
any permit which may be required under any other law or
regulation for the serving of food and beverages, including
alcoholic beverage permits.
(6) Signage: refer to the signs and billboards article of this chapter.83
(7) Utilities: all utilities shall be placed underground.
(8) Stormwater management: Surface stormwater management basins
should not be placed within front yards. [Amended 6-28-2007 by
L.L. No. 10-2007]
C. Architectural design.
(1) Neighborhood compatibility. Buildings shall be compatible with or
improve upon the surrounding neighborhood and other commercial
districts. Compatibility shall be achieved through the use of similar
building massing, materials, scale, colors and other architectural
features. Larger buildings shall be permitted when designed to be
perceived as several buildings clustered together. It is the visual
connection that leads to the success of an area of development to
be recognized as a place with a character that distinguishes it from
other places. The following standards shall apply:
(a) Two-story buildings are encouraged.
(b) First-story height should be a minimum of 10 feet measured
floor to floor.
(c) Pitched, gambrel or mansard roofs recommended.
(2) Roof. Pitched, hip (gable), gambrel or mansard roofs are
recommended. Flat roofs should incorporate a parapet with cornice
details along facades facing public streets. Plain parapets are
discouraged. Pitched roofs should complement the overall style and
scale of the building. Materials for pitched roofs shall avoid having
a reflective finish. Colors should complement the overall character
83.Editor's Note: See Art. XV, Signs and Billboards.
§ 190-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-42
1:741
of the building. Pitched roofs shall take measures to ensure that
falling snow, ice or rain do not create pedestrian hazards.
Roof examples
(3) Facade treatment and fenestration.
(a) The arrangement of building doors and windows helps to
communicate the nature of a building. Building fenestration
measures the amount of depth (such as a recessed entry) and
openings (such as window area) on a facade. Building
transparency is important at the street level, particularly for
retail establishments. Consequently, the ground floor of the
building shall provide the greatest amount of facade opening,
making it inviting to pedestrian traffic. The use of depth is
encouraged to highlight facade openings such as windows.
Windows should not be mounted flush to the exterior of the
facade.
§ 190-42 COLONIE CODE § 190-42
1:742
(b) Overall facade composition should break the building down
into smaller distinct portions to provide a small-scale
impression related to the pedestrian. Floor-to-ceiling windows
are strongly discouraged. Second-floor windows should related
to the first in shape, form and pattern. Windows should make
up at least 30% of the facade on all floors. Windows should not
be mounted flush to the exterior of the facade. The
architectural treatment of the front building facade should be
continued in its major features, around all visible sides from
the primary street. Blank, windowless walls are strongly
discouraged.
(4) Awnings and canopies. Awnings and canopies are not required
components of building design, however, their use is encouraged
on facades that face public streets. If awnings and canopies are
used, their coverings shall be made of canvas. Plastic-, metal- and
wood-covered awnings are not permissible. Internal lighting or
backlighting of awnings and canopies shall not be permitted. Color

elements should be designed as integral parts of the
architecture. Manufactured components attached to the
outside of buildings, such as stairways and sheds, shall be
prohibited.
(f) Architecture within each multifamily project should use a
palette of materials which conveys an image of quality and
durability.
(g) All the facades should employ the same vocabulary of
materials.
(h) Painted surfaces should use colors that reinforce architectural
concepts and are compatible with natural materials, such as
brick or stone.
(3) Lighting. Lighting should be an integral part of the planning and
design of multifamily projects and not treated as an afterthought.
(a) Lighting in projects should be designed for specific tasks (i.e.,
illuminating common areas, parking, streets, paths, and
entryways).
(b) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than
10 to 12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than
the greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting
already on the premises, or the building height for the area
lighting. [Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]

§ 190-43. Office Residential (OR).
Design and development standards for the Office Residential (OR) District
have been created to facilitate a mixed-use environment that fosters greater
opportunity to balance employment and housing opportunities. The
following standards are organized as three categories: site organization,
site design, and architectural design. In general, the standards reflect
recommended or encouraged design elements that are intended to promote
the goals of the district and should be implemented to the fullest extent
practical. Where a standard includes the word "shall" or "must," it is
integral to the goals of the district and is mandatory. However, the Planning
Board may waive these standards to the extent it deems necessary in order
to secure a reasonable development of the site. In such case, the applicant
must establish that there are no practical alternatives to the proposed
waiver that would conform to the standard, and the Planning Board shall
issue a written finding stating the extent of and justification for the waiver.
pressure sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(d) Fixtures and posts should be consistent throughout the project.
(e) Fixtures should incorporate cutoffs to screen the view of light
sources from residences.
(4) Landscaping. Landscaping for multifamily projects should
integrate the projects with the neighborhood and coherently
support site and architectural concepts.
(a) All site areas not covered by structures, walkways, driveways
or parking spaces should be landscaped.
(b) Landscaping should support the distinction and transition
between private, common and public spaces.
(c) Landscape materials should be live plants.
(d) Natural features and existing trees should be incorporated into
the landscape plan.
(e) Plazas and common areas subject to pedestrian traffic may be
surfaced with a combination of landscape and decorative
pavers or textured concrete.
(f) Parking lots should be generously landscaped to provide
shade, reduce glare and provide visual interest.
(g) At least 15% of shared parking lots shall be landscaped. Lots
shall be screened from view with architectural walls, berms or
shrubs.
A. Site organization.
§ 190-42 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-43
1:747
(1) Building placement.
(a) Buildings must present their main facade and entrance toward
the street. Buildings should be oriented parallel or
perpendicular to the public sidewalk and allow for parking in
the rear or side of the proposed structure.
(b) A minimum frontage build-out of 60% is recommended to
create a near-continuous facade along the sidewalk. This
frontage may consist of a combination of the building and a
small landscape fencing made of wrought iron, common brick
or some other natural material. The intent is to create
continuous frontage to more clearly define a pedestrian
environment and an improved aesthetic setting.
(c) Maximum setback. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No.
10-2007]
[1] On a minor road, the maximum setback shall be 20 feet.
[2] On a major road, the maximum setback shall be 25 feet.
[3] On a through lot or corner lot, the maximum setback shall
apply only on one street, and major roads shall take
precedence.
[4] On a lot containing more than one building, the maximum
setback requirement shall apply only to the building
located closest to the front lot line.
[5] On a lot containing an existing building, the maximum
setback requirement shall not be mandatory. However, any
new construction should comply with the intent of the
maximum setback provisions as far as is practical.
(2) On-street parking. On-street parking is encouraged where
appropriate, with bulb-outs of the sidewalk at the end of each block
to allow for easy pedestrian crossings.
(3) Off-street parking.
(a) Off-street parking is encouraged to be at the rear of the
building. Side-of-building parking is also permitted. New
parking in the front yard shall be prohibited. Further, drivethrough
access aisles and stacking spaces shall be prohibited
within the front yard.
(b) Off-street parking areas shall have landscaped buffers at least
15 feet in width between the parking area and edge of the
sidewalk or front lot line, whichever is closer, which includes
trees, hedges, shrubs and/or low walls consisting of wood,
brick, wrought iron or an acceptable substitute.
§ 190-43 COLONIE CODE § 190-43
1:748
(c) Parking structures with active uses at street level are
encouraged. The sidewalk level facades of garages shall be
designed to obscure the view of parked cars.
(d) For parking areas greater than 20 stalls, a minimum 20 square
feet of landscaped island shall be included in the interior of the
parking area for each stall. An island shall be considered to be
in the interior of the parking area if at least 75% of its
perimeter abuts parking area pavement. [Amended
6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-200784; 8-28-2008 by L.L. No.
8-2008]
(e) Landscaping requirements shall include the following
standards:
[1] Canopy/deciduous trees: 2.5 inches in caliper.
[2] Small flowering trees: two inches in caliper.
[3] Large shrubs: 30 inches in height.
(f) Shared access points servicing adjoining parcels shall be
developed where appropriate to reduce curb cuts. A single
access to adjoining parking lots or an interconnection between
adjoining parking lots is encouraged and may be required
where necessary to provide safe traffic management. Cross
easements should be used to formalize shared access
arrangements between parcels.
(g) In no case shall parking be allowed on access roads.
(h) Peak period (spillover) parking areas with alternative pervious
paving materials are encouraged and could include grass
pavers and gravel surfaces.
(4) New streets.
(a) If new streets are developed, they shall create or continue an
interconnected network of streets laid out in walkable blocks.
Culs-de-sac and dead-end streets are strongly discouraged,
except where topography or natural features make these
necessary.
(b) Well-defined, ADA-compliant crosswalks, small turning radii at
intersections and other traffic-calming elements should be
incorporated.
(5) Green space. Within this district, the green space percentage is a
minimum of 35%. Refer to the incentive zoning provisions of this
chapter for green space "credits." Reduction in green space is

followed this section, and renumbered subsequent sections as necessary.
§ 190-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-43
1:749
intended to be aesthetically balanced and accommodated through
quality and design of the open space. Green space should be
organized in a meaningful and useful manner and should include
one or more parks, squares or community greens where
appropriate.
B. Site design.
(1) Screening and buffering. Landscape buffers between residential
and commercial areas shall be used to lessen adverse impacts such
as noise, fumes and privacy concerns. Acceptable screening
techniques include combinations of vegetated landscaping,
landscaping walls, fencing (excluding chain link), and earth
berming. When residential uses are adjacent to commercial uses,
additional screening treatments shall be required. Generally, the
buffer shall include a variety of local plant species, including a mix
of deciduous and evergreen trees. Parking, services, and loading/
maneuvering areas should be reasonably landscaped and screened
from view of adjacent properties and from within the project site.
(2) Site lighting.
(a) Pedestrian-scaled lighting and area lighting are required.
(b) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than
10 to 12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than
the greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting
already on the premises, or the building height for the area
lighting. [Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]
(c) The light source shall not be visible from any angle from
adjacent streets or properties or the sky. Lights shall be
designed and installed so as not to cause illumination beyond
the boundaries of the site. Flashing or excessively bright
sources of illumination shall be prohibited.
(d) To provide optimum color rendition, lamps are preferred in the
following order: high-pressure sodium, metal halide, low-
§ 190-43 COLONIE CODE § 190-43
1:750
pressure sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site
should be avoided.
(3) Sidewalks.
(a) Sidewalks connecting residential areas with commercial areas
shall be constructed of concrete, brick, concrete pavers, stone
pavers, or stone slabs, and shall be five feet wide; sidewalks in
commercial areas should be a minimum of eight feet wide. A
minimum four-foot-wide landscaping buffer should be provided
between the sidewalk and street. The landscaping buffer shall
be planted with grass and include one large deciduous tree for
each 35 linear feet of road frontage, planted generally parallel
to the adjacent road. The purpose of the landscaping is to
provide enhanced pedestrian safety, help create definition
along the roadway and to provide shade. Where a planting
strip is not possible, street trees should be planted between the
curb and the building line. All street tree planting in paved
areas should be covered with a porous hard-surfaced grate.
Trees should not be planted closer than seven feet to the
building line. Tree species may include ash, elm, maple, oak, or
as approved by the PEDD or Planning Board. [Amended
8-28-2008 by L.L. No. 8-2008]
(b) Where a parking lot access drive crosses the sidewalk, the
concrete paving pattern of the sidewalk shall continue
uninterrupted. Where enhanced paving is used, the pattern
generally abuts asphalt. In these cases, a band of natural
concrete should be added as a protective edging between the
asphalt and the decorative paving.
(c) When the building is set back on the site, sidewalk connections
shall be provided from the public street sidewalk to the front of
the building.
(d) Sidewalks shall connect to adjoining properties and existing
sidewalks. Where sidewalks do not exist prior to the proposed
project, then the Planning Board shall refer to the
Comprehensive Plan to determine if sidewalks should be
included as a component of the proposed project. Bollards may
be incorporated at sidewalk road crossings.
§ 190-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-43
1:751
(4) Public spaces.
(a) Public spaces allow for residents and workers to meet
informally and socialize. Public space is strongly encouraged
and shall include landscaping and benches. Landscaping shall
include trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals. If public space is
constructed it should be constructed on the side of a building
which receives the most sunlight. Benches should be placed
under trees to provide shaded areas for people using the
space. Sidewalks shall be constructed of concrete, brick,
concrete and stone pavers, or stone slabs. Incorporation of
works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or entrance
lobbies is encouraged.
(b) Public plazas are strongly encouraged. Plazas are areas that
provide amenities such as seating, ornamental fountains,
lighting, and landscaping for use by pedestrians. Incorporation
of works of art into the public spaces, exterior facade or
entrance lobbies is encouraged. Area should be landscaped
with trees, shrubs, perennials and annuals, ornamental
lighting and benches. Area should be constructed on the side of
a building that receives the most sunlight when possible.
Enhanced paving should be used to accent important places
outdoors: at entrances as a "welcome mat" and in spaces
where people congregate, pause or wait.
(5) Outdoor dining.
(a) Outdoor dining is a dining area of a designated size with
seating and/or tables located outdoors of a restaurant, coffee
shop or other food service establishment, which is located
§ 190-43 COLONIE CODE § 190-43
1:752
entirely outside the walls of the subject building; enclosed on
two sides or fewer by the walls of the building with or without
a solid roof cover; or enclosed on three sides by the walls of
the building without a solid roof cover. The seating may be in
addition to the indoor seating or it may be the only seating
available for the restaurant. The outdoor dining area must be
visually and architecturally integrated with the building and
site pursuant to the design standards.
(b) Structures shall be consistent with existing state regulations
for safety. If at the side of a building, an edge matching the line
of the building facade should be created, the edge should be
made of transparent fence made of wood or wrought iron at a
maximum height of four feet. In no case should the fence/
railing combination prohibit views from the sidewalk into the
cafe area.
(c) The width of the public portion of the sidewalk adjacent to the
street shall not be constricted by the restaurant seating area.
There shall be a minimum of five feet of clear distance or 50%
of the sidewalk width, whichever is greater, in the public rightof-
way, free of all obstructions to allow adequate pedestrian
movement. The minimum distance shall be measured from the
line or nearest sidewalk obstruction adjacent to the curbline,
such as a public bench, garbage receptacle or utility pole.
Outdoor seating shall not be allowed if the minimum public
clearance distance is not met.
(d) Outdoor dining area furnishings shall consist solely of readily
removable umbrellas, covers, tables, chairs, planters
containing live plants, and decorative accessories. The number
and location of tables shall be compliant with the maximum
occupancy and aisle width standards for dining facilities set
forth in the New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and
Building Code. No furnishing or other object may be attached,
even in a temporary manner, to the sidewalk or other public
property or to any building or structure. All furnishings shall
be removed from the sidewalk and stored indoors when the
establishment is closed.
(e) Outdoor dining areas, including the adjacent public right-ofway
along the building frontage, shall be kept free and clear at
all times of litter, debris, and any substance that may damage
the sidewalk or cause injury to a pedestrian. Failure to comply
will result in a violation of the conditions of approval.
(f) All foods and beverages shall be prepared within the
establishment in compliance with the terms and conditions of
any permit which may be required under any other law or
regulation for the serving of food and beverages, including
alcoholic beverage permits.
§ 190-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-43
1:753
(6) Signage: refer to the signs and billboards article of this chapter.85
(7) Utilities: all utilities shall be placed underground.
(8) Stormwater management: Surface stormwater management basins
should not be placed within front yards. [Amended 6-28-2007 by
L.L. No. 10-2007]
C. Architectural design.
(1) Neighborhood compatibility. Buildings shall be compatible with or
improve upon the surrounding neighborhood and other commercial
districts. Compatibility shall be achieved through the use of similar
building massing, materials, scale, colors and other architectural
features. Larger buildings shall be permitted when designed to be
perceived as several buildings clustered together. It is the visual
connection that leads to the success of an area of development to
be recognized as a place with a character that distinguishes it from
other places. The following standards shall apply:
(a) Multiple-story buildings are strongly encouraged.
(b) First-story height should be a minimum of 12 feet measured
floor to floor.
(2) Roof. Pitched, flat, gambrel or mansard roofs are recommended.
Flat roofs should incorporate a parapet with cornice details along
facades facing public streets. Plain parapets are discouraged.
Pitched roofs should complement the overall style and scale of the
building. Materials for pitched roofs shall avoid having a reflective
finish. Colors should complement the overall character of the
building. Pitched roofs shall take measures to ensure that falling
snow, ice or rain do not create pedestrian hazards.
85.Editor's Note See Art. XV, Signs and Billboards.
§ 190-43 COLONIE CODE § 190-43
1:754
(3) Facade treatment and fenestration.
(a) The arrangement of building doors and windows helps to
communicate the nature of a building. Building fenestration
measures the amount of depth (such as a recessed entry) and
openings (such as window area) on a facade. Building
transparency is important at the street level, particularly for
retail establishments. Consequently, the ground floor of the
building shall provide the greatest amount of facade opening,
making it inviting to pedestrian traffic. The use of depth is
encouraged to highlight facade openings such as windows.
Windows should not be mounted flush to the exterior of the
facade.
(b) Overall facade composition should break the building down
into smaller distinct portions to provide a small-scale
impression related to the pedestrian. Building transparency
and interior lighting is important at the street level;
consequently, ground-floor level should have a minimum 30%
§ 190-43 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-43
1:755
glass surface that is oriented vertically. Windows on the first
floor should be oriented vertically. Floor-to-ceiling windows are
strongly discouraged. Those on the second floor shall relate
to the first in shape, form and pattern. Upper-floor windows
should related to the first in shape, form and pattern and
should make up at least 30% of the facade. Windows should
not be mounted flush to the exterior of the facade. Storefront
construction should be recessed enough at the point of entry to
allow the door to swing out without obstructing the sidewalk.
The architectural treatment of the front building facade should
be continued in its major features around all visible sides
from the primary street. Blank, windowless walls are strongly
discouraged.
(4) Awnings and canopies: Awnings and canopies are not encouraged.
(5) Specialty equipment.
(a) Rooftop mechanical equipment, satellite dishes, antennas and
other equipment shall be screened from public view by the use
of architecturally compatible materials, parapets, sloped roof
form or walls that are at least as high as the equipment being
screened.
(b) Ground-level mechanical and service equipment (such as
dumpsters, loading docks, and utility boxes) shall be screened
from public view by landscaping, natural material walls and
opaque fencing, and/or other design treatments compatible
with the finishes of the principal structure.
(6) Materials and color.
(a) The quality of exterior materials shall be sufficiently durable to
guarantee low maintenance, stability and a reasonable life
span.
(b) Preferred facade materials:
[1] Common red brick.
[2] Architectural masonry units (colored, textured, painted).
[3] Natural stone, stone veneer or cast stone.
[4] Wood.
[5] Siding of high quality product simulating a natural
material.
(c) Strongly discouraged materials:
[1] Plain (bare) masonry units.
[2] Plain vinyl or metal siding.
§ 190-43 COLONIE CODE § 190-43

neighborhoods that are well integrated into the existing community. In
general, the standards reflect recommended or encouraged design
elements that are intended to promote the goals of the district and should
be implemented to the fullest extent practical. Where a standard includes
the word "shall" or "must," it is integral to the goals of the district and
is mandatory. However, the Planning Board may waive these standards to
the extent it deems necessary in order to secure a reasonable development
of the site. In such case, the applicant must establish that there are no
practical alternatives to the proposed waiver that would conform to the
standard, and the Planning Board shall issue a written finding stating the
extent of and justification for the waiver.
A. Site planning. New multifamily projects should be an integral part of
the neighborhood and the community that create a comfortable and
social living environment for residents.
(1) Buildings should frame neighborhood gateways and define
community and common open spaces.
(2) Public, communal and private spaces should be clearly
distinguishable.
(3) Ground-floor units should have direct access from streets and
common spaces.
(4) Units should provide "eyes-on-the-street" security by orienting
towards streets and common areas.
(5) Site entries should distinguish themselves with added texture or
use of contrasting materials.
(6) Entry drives to multifamily housing should be designed to create a
positive identity for the project. Landscape and site design should
frame and distinguish entry drives.
(7) Parking shall be screened by landscaping or buildings.
(8) Parking should be unobtrusive and not disrupt the quality of
common spaces and pedestrian environments of multifamily
development.
(9) Visible long and unbroken rows of parked cars or garage doors
should not be permitted. Garage door width facing the street shall
not exceed 50% of the width of the building. Parking should be
distributed throughout the site in courts and garages.
(10) In no event shall the garage extend beyond the habitable area of
the house.
(11) In the event of rear yard alleys, no setback from the lot line along
the alley shall be required for detached garages.
§ 190-44 COLONIE CODE § 190-44
1:760
(12) Services for multifamily development should not be visible from
public areas. Trash bins, utility meters, transformers and other
service elements shall be enclosed or otherwise concealed from
view.
(13) Surface stormwater management basins should not be placed
within front yards.
B. Architectural design. The design of new multifamily projects should
demonstrate a commitment to lasting and durable design.
(1) Multifamily projects should utilize a unifying theme and possess a
common vocabulary of forms and architectural elements.
(2) Building forms should be articulated by varying roof heights and
wall planes. Long unbroken volumes and large unarticulated wall
and roof planes shall not be permitted.
(3) Facades should have three-dimensional elements, such as
chimneys, balconies, bay windows or dormers, to break up large
wall and roof surfaces.
(4) Every facade should be well composed and articulated, with
consistent treatment on all facades.
(5) Stairways, fences, trash enclosures and other accessory elements
should be designed as integral parts of the architecture.
Manufactured components attached to the outside of buildings,
such as stairways and sheds, shall be prohibited.
(6) Architecture within each multifamily project should use a palette of
materials which conveys an image of quality and durability.
(7) All the facades should employ the same vocabulary of materials.
(8) Painted surfaces should use colors that reinforce architectural
concepts and are compatible with natural materials, such as brick
or stone.
C. Lighting. Lighting should be an integral part of the planning and design
of multifamily projects and not treated as an afterthought.
(1) Lighting in projects should be designed for specific tasks (i.e.,
illuminating common areas, parking, streets, paths, and
entryways).
(2) Light fixtures shall be no higher from the finished grade than 10 to
12 feet for pedestrian-scaled lighting, and no higher than the
greater of 18 feet, the existing height of area lighting already on
the premises, or the building height for the area lighting.
[Amended 11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 17-2014]
(3) To provide optimum color rendition, lamps are preferred in the
following order: high-pressure sodium, metal halide, low-pressure
§ 190-44 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-44
1:761
§ 190-45. Single-family residential development located in PDD
zones, conservation development subdivisions, NCOR Districts and
multifamily residential districts.
Design and development standards for single-family residential
development located in PDD zones, conservation development design
overlays and multifamily residential districts have been created to develop
housing in a way that conserves the desirable characteristics of established
neighborhoods while creating new livable neighborhoods that are well
integrated into the existing community. In general, the standards reflect
recommended or encouraged design elements that are intended to promote
the goals of the district, and should be implemented to the fullest extent
practical. Where a standard includes the word "shall" or "must," it is
integral to the goals of the district and is mandatory. However, the Planning
Board may waive these standards to the extent it deems necessary in order
to secure a reasonable development of the site. In such case, the applicant
must establish that there are no practical alternatives to the proposed
waiver that would conform to the standard, and the Planning Board shall
issue a written finding stating the extent of and justification for the waiver.
sodium. A mixture of lamp types on the same site should be
avoided.
(4) Fixtures and posts should be consistent throughout the project.
(5) Fixtures should incorporate cutoffs to screen the view of light
sources from residences.
D. Landscaping. Landscaping for multifamily projects should integrate the
projects with the neighborhood and coherently support site and
architectural concepts.
(1) All site areas not covered by structures, walkways, driveways or
parking spaces should be landscaped.
(2) Landscaping should support the distinction and transition between
private, common and public spaces.
(3) Landscape materials should be live plants.
(4) Natural features and existing trees should be incorporated into the
landscape plan.
(5) Plazas and common areas subject to pedestrian traffic may be
surfaced with a combination of landscape and decorative pavers or
textured concrete.
(6) Parking lots should be generously landscaped to provide shade,
reduce glare and provide visual interest.
(7) At least 15% of shared parking lots shall be landscaped. Lots shall
be screened from view with architectural walls, berms or shrubs.
§ 190-44 COLONIE CODE § 190-45
1:762
§ 190-46. Administration and enforcement.
The provisions of this article shall be primarily administered and enforced
by the Planning and Economic Development Department, which shall have
the power to make necessary inspections.
A. Architectural design. The design of new residential subdivision projects
should provide a variety of styles and high quality architecture.
(1) Front porches are strongly encouraged.
(2) Each block face should include a variety of one- and two-story
elements.
(3) Larger wall and roof planes should include three-dimensional
design features, such as chimneys, balconies, bay windows or
dormers.
(4) All facades of a home, including side and rear elevations, should
have the same vocabulary of forms, detail and materials.
(5) Architecture within each multifamily project should use a palette of
materials which conveys an image of quality and durability.
B. Site planning. Site planning for new housing should result in housing
that relates well to the streetscape and integrates well into the adjacent
neighborhoods.
(1) Garages:
(a) In no event shall the garage extend beyond the habitable area
of the house.
(b) Garages should not dominate the front elevation of the house.
To that end, garage door width facing the street shall not
exceed 50% of the width of the home.
(c) In the event of rear yard alleys, no setback from the lot line
along the alley shall be required for detached garages.
(2) Driveways. Driveways should not dominate the front yard
landscape with excessively wide pavement. Minimizing driveway
width and impervious surfaces in the front yard setback will reduce
stormwater runoff. To achieve these design and environmental
goals, the maximum driveway width for two-car garages shall be 16
feet within the required front yard setback.

ARTICLE X
General Regulations
§ 190-47. Parking.
A. Intent. It is the intent of the following parking regulations to ensure
that there are adequate parking and loading facilities to serve the use
or uses of the property; ensure that any parking facility is so designed
to provide proper circulation, reduce hazards to pedestrians, and
protect the users of adjoining properties from nuisance caused by the
noise, fumes, and glare of headlights which may result from the
operation of vehicles parking off the street; and reduce congestion in
the streets and contribute to traffic safety.
B. Minimum requirements. The following parking standards represent
minimum requirements and may be altered as part of the approval of a
site development plan:
(1) All requirements based on square footage shall be for gross floor
area, unless otherwise stated.
(2) All requirements based on number of employees shall be for the
maximum number of employees on the shift of greatest
employment.
(3) All requirements based on occupancy shall be determined by the
New York State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code
occupancy limits.
(4) Facilities containing a mixture of the specific uses enumerated
herein shall provide parking in proportion to the percentage of the
facility devoted to each use.
C. Existing structures. Any structure or land use lawfully in existence prior
to the adoption of this chapter shall not be subject to the requirements
of this subsection so long as the kind or extent of use is not changed,
and provided further that any parking facilities now serving such
structures shall not in the future be reduced below such requirements.
D. Minimum off-street parking requirements.
(1) Where no requirement is designated and the use is not comparable
to any of the listed uses, parking requirements shall be determined
by the Planning Board upon recommendation of the PEDD, based
upon the capacity of the facility and its associated uses.
(2) When a calculation yields a fractional number of required spaces,
the number of spaces shall be rounded to the nearest whole
number.
E. Maximum allowable number of spaces.
§ 190-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-47
1:765
(1) The number of spaces provided for any particular use in ground
surface lots, excluding designated handicapped parking spaces,
shall not exceed the number of spaces required by this article by
more than 25%. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007]
(2) Spaces provided within the building footprint of structures, such as
in rooftop parking or below-grade parking, shall not count towards
the maximum number of allowable spaces.
(3) Spaces provided in multilevel parking above or below surface lots
shall not count towards the maximum number of allowable spaces.
F. Parking dimensional requirements. The dimension of a typical parking
space under this section shall be nine feet by 18 feet, and the minimum
driveway width shall be 24 feet. These standards may be modified as
deemed necessary by the Planning Board to ensure adequate and
convenient access and circulation.
G. Parking setback requirements. No parking or loading area for any
multifamily use or nonresidential use, except for driveway entrances
and exits and drive-through lanes, shall be located nearer than 15 feet
to the edge of the sidewalk or front lot line, whichever is closer, or 10
feet to any side or rear lot line. The Planning Board may waive the side
or rear lot line setback requirements as necessary to accommodate
shared parking facilities between adjacent lots or to ensure reasonable
development of a site, provided that the intent of these regulations as
stated above is met. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No. 10-2007;
11-20-2014 by L.L. No. 14-2014]
H. Joint use of facilities. Parking facilities required for two or more
adjacent uses, structures or parcels of land may be satisfied by the
same parking facilities used jointly, to the extent that it can be shown by
the owners or operators that the parking demand for the facilities does
not materially overlap, and provided that such right of joint use is
evidenced by a deed, lease, contract, reciprocal easement or similar
written instrument establishing a permanent or long-term agreement
for the joint use. Any approval granted on the basis of a joint parking
use agreement shall be valid only so long as the agreement remains in
effect.
I. Parking for disabled persons. Parking spaces for disabled persons shall
comply with the current Americans with Disabilities Act or New York
State Uniform Fire Prevention and Building Code standards, whichever

each motor vehicle may proceed to and from the parking space
§ 190-47 COLONIE CODE § 190-47
1:766
provided for it without the moving of any other motor vehicle, except in
the following instances:
(1) Stacked or valet parking may be allowed at the discretion of the

existing or the permitted use of contiguous land and of adjacent
neighborhoods, without creating adverse effects; and to ensure that the
health, safety, welfare, comfort and convenience of the public is fully
considered; and to promote consistency in the development of the Town
of Colonie with the goals and objectives of its Comprehensive Plan and
other current planning studies and reports.
B. Applicability. These site plan review provisions apply to: [Amended

roads shall be adequate but not excessive in number; adequate in
width, paving, grade, alignment and visibility; and not located too
near street corners or places of public assembly. Necessary traffic
signalization, signs, dividers and other safety controls, devices and
facilities shall be given proper consideration and duly provided
wherever appropriate or warranted.
(2) Frontage on street. Each lot shall have direct frontage of at least 15
feet on an improved street and provision for vehicular access to
said street, in accordance with § 280a of the State of New York
Town Law. A greater frontage may be required pursuant to other
provisions of this chapter. Such frontage may be on a public street
or on a private street owned by a condominium association, in
which the lot owner has an ownership interest by virtue of
§ 190-55.1 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-56
1:795
membership in the association, and which street connects to a
public street. Vehicular access to the street may be directly through
the subject lot or by easement through an adjacent lot or lots,
subject to approval by the Planning Board.
(3) Pedestrian safety and access. Safe, adequate and convenient
pedestrian access and circulation shall be provided both within the
site and to adjacent streets, with particular attention to all
intersections with vehicular traffic.
(4) Circulation and parking. Off-street parking and loading spaces shall
be arranged with consideration given to their location, sufficiency

size and design of the buildings, lighting and signs shall be
compatible to each other and with the site as a whole. Sufficient
separation between buildings shall be maintained to ensure
adequate access, circulation, light, air and solar access.
(13) Impact of the proposed use on adjacent land uses. Adjacent and
neighboring properties shall be protected against noise, glare,
unsightliness or other objectionable features. Where a proposed
use is a nonresidential use which would adjoin residential areas,
special consideration shall be given by the Planning Board to
minimizing the impact of the proposed use on the residential
properties.
(14) Snow clearance and removal. The means employed to address
snow and ice removal from sidewalks, parking lots and driveways

harmony with the natural environment and in keeping with the
character of the surrounding neighborhood.
(16) Impact of the proposed use on both on-site and off-site
infrastructure. The proposed project shall not place an undue
burden on the existing infrastructure's capacity (i.e., roadways,

statutorily mandated public hearing(s) have associated with
them but shall conform to such notification requirements as
may be adopted by the Town Board or Planning Board.
(e) The Planning Board shall act to approve, deny or approve with
modification the final site plan. Failure to act does not

consistent with the terms of any applicable special use permit or
planning special permit approval (or if no such permit is required)
and does not represent a substantial change from the approved site
plan, the amendment shall be approved.
(2) If the Planning Board determines that the proposed amendment is
consistent with the terms of the applicable special use permit or
planning special permit approval (or if no such permit is required)
but is a substantial change from the approved site plan, it shall
follow the procedures for site plan approval contained above.

operation into compliance with the provisions of such plan. In the
event that the owner and tenants have failed to comply or maintain
compliance with the final site plan after being ordered by the PEDD
to make such corrections, the penalties for offenses provisions of this
chapter shall become applicable.

shall be valid for one year from the date of issuance. Any Planning
Board final site plan approval shall be valid for two years from the date

the date that notice of a Planning Board decision granting such
acceptance or approval is filed in the office of the Town Clerk.
O. Extension of approval. Application materials required shall be for the
purpose of determining whether any change in the condition of the site
or its environs has occurred or whether the applicable law has been
changed. The extension will only be granted provided the plans have
been reviewed by the Planning and Economic Development Department
and such other agencies as it deems appropriate and due consideration
of the application has been made by the Planning Board. If there is no
substantial change in the condition of the site or its environs or in the
applicable law:

A. Purpose.
B. The primary purpose of special use permit review is to ensure the use's
compatibility with the surrounding neighborhood and to ensure the
long-term benefit of the use to the Town. The intent of this section is to
set forth additional considerations and requirements which shall apply
to certain land uses and activities that, due to their special
§ 190-56 COLONIE CODE § 190-57
1:812
characteristics or the special characteristics of the area in which they
are to be located, require particular consideration so that they may
be properly planned and located with respect to the objectives of this
chapter and their effect on the surrounding properties and community
character.
C. It is the policy of the Town of Colonie to allow a variety of uses of land,
but only when such uses do not adversely affect neighboring properties
or the natural environment of the Town. Many uses are therefore
permitted only upon issuance of a special use permit by the Zoning
Board of Appeals or a planning special permit by the Planning Board, in
order to ensure that these uses are appropriate to their surroundings
and consistent with the Town's Comprehensive Plan. Accessory uses or
structures used in connection with a special use permit, planning
special permit, or site plan use shall be subject to the same approval
requirements as the principal structure or use. [Amended 5-1-2014
by L.L. No. 8-2014]

forth herein. In order to reach positive findings in support of the
requested permit, the applicable board may require reasonable
conditions, restrictions and/or modifications to the project. Such
reasonable conditions and restrictions shall be directly related to and
incidental to the proposed permit. If the board does not make a positive
finding in support of the special use permit, it shall deny the requested
permit. In issuance of such a denial or approval, the record of the
appropriate board must address the standards outlined below and
include the facts and reasons upon which such denial was based.
[Amended 5-1-2014 by L.L. No. 8-2014]

1:816
F. Findings required. In granting or denying special use permits and
planning special permits, the Zoning Board of Appeals and Planning
Board, respectively, shall take into consideration the scale of the
proposed project and the possible impact of the proposed project on
neighboring properties. [Amended 5-1-2014 by L.L. No. 8-2014]
(1) Special use permit (Zoning Board of Appeals). Before granting such
permit, the Zoning Board of Appeals shall determine:
(a) That the use conforms with the specific special use permit
standards found in § 190-22M, if applicable.
(b) That the use is consistent with the Town's current planning
documents, including the Comprehensive Plan.
(c) That the use is consistent with the neighborhood and zoning
district in which it is located and will not alter the essential
character of the neighborhood. To make this determination,
the applicable board must make the following further findings:
[1] That the use will be suitable for the property on which it is
proposed, considering the property's size, location,
topography, vegetation, soils, natural habitat and
hydrology and, if appropriate, its ability, if desirable, to be
buffered or screened from neighboring properties and
public roads.
[2] That the use will be compatible with adjoining properties
and with the natural and man-made environment.
[3] That the use will not adversely affect surrounding land
uses by creating excessive noise, dust, odors, glare,
pollution or other nuisances.
[4] That the use will not cause undue traffic congestion,
unduly impair pedestrian safety or overload existing roads,

Subdivision
§ 190-59. Classification.
Subdivisions of land are classified as follows:
§ 190-60. General requirements and standards.
A. Exempt subdivision: Transfer of real property from one parcel of land to
an adjoining parcel such that no new lots are created (transferred
property must be merged with the receiving parcel), provided that
neither parcel is shown on a previously filed subdivision map. No review
pursuant to this article shall be required for such actions; however, the
transfer may not create or increase any nonconformance to the
dimensional requirements article of this chapter.95
B. Minor subdivision: Subdivision of a parcel of land into four lots or fewer,
where no new public streets are required. [Amended 8-28-2008 by
L.L. No. 8-2008]
C. Subdivision amendment:
(1) Division of land for commercial, industrial or multifamily residence
use in a previously filed subdivision, where resultant parcels are
subject to Planning Board site plan review and no new public
streets or utilities are required.
(2) Transfer of real property from one parcel of land to an adjoining
parcel such that no new lots are created, where any of the affected
parcels is shown on a previously filed subdivision map.
D. Major subdivision: Any subdivision not classified as exempt, minor or an
amendment. Any application made for further subdivision of a lot or lots
created in a minor subdivision within five calendar years of the date of
filing of the approved plan shall be considered a major subdivision if the
total number of lots created from the original subdivided parcel is five
or greater.
E. Conservation subdivision: A major subdivision developed pursuant to
the provisions of the Conservation Development Overlay District
standards as set forth in the overlay districts article of this chapter.96
The Planning Board may, in its discretion, apply the overlay district
standards to a subdivision of land outside the limits of the overlay
district, subject to the additional general requirements for conservation
subdivisions as set forth below. [Amended 6-28-2007 by L.L. No.

within 60 days of the date upon which the plan is signed by the
Planning Board's designated agent, the approval of the subdivision
shall become null and void.
(23) Filing of section of approved subdivision. In the event the applicant
shall file only a section of the approved subdivision in the office of
the County Clerk, the entire approved subdivision shall be filed
within 30 days of the filing of such section with the Town Clerk of
the Town of Colonie, together with proof of filing of the first
section. Such section shall encompass at least 10% of the total
number of lots contained in the approved subdivision. Approval of
the remaining sections shall expire unless said sections are filed
§ 190-61 COLONIE CODE § 190-61
1:848
with three years of the date of the Planning Board's action granting
final approval.
(24) Construction inspection. Upon filing of the final subdivision
approval and such other permits and approvals as may be
necessary, the applicant shall develop the site in strict compliance
with the approved plans and in conformance with such additional
conditions as may have been imposed by the Planning Board in
granting conceptual or final subdivision approval. The Planning
Board may request that the Town's Construction Inspector act as

grading and landscaping plans for individual lots if required, the
PEDD will advise the Building Department that building permits
may be issued for lots within the subdivision. The applicant shall
develop the individual lots in conformance with the approved
subdivision plans. Unless a site-specific grading plan has been
required for an individual lot, the subdivision grading plan shall be
followed as a guideline to ensure proper grading and drainage,
consistent with the general requirements of this article.
(26) Verification of landscaping and grading. Upon acceptance by the
Town of all required subdivision improvements and dedication by
the Town Board of any new streets, and verification of completion
of landscaping and grading requirements for individual lots in
accordance with approved plans, the PEDD will advise the Building
Department that certificates of occupancy may be issued for lots
within the subdivision.
(27) Issuance of certificate of occupancy. Upon issuance of a certificate
of occupancy for an individual lot, the lot owner shall be
responsible for continued compliance with any conditions of the
subdivision approval with respect to that lot. If the Planning Board
or the PEDD finds that any of the conditions of an approved plan
have not continued to be met, the PEDD shall order the owner and
tenants to make such corrections as it deems necessary to bring
the lot into compliance with the provisions of such plan. In the
event that the owner and tenants have failed to comply or maintain
compliance with the final subdivision plan after being ordered by
the PEDD to make such corrections, the penalties for offenses
provisions of this chapter shall become applicable.106 Unless
105. Editor's Note: See Ch. 162, Art. II, Highway Specifications.

grading by an individual lot owner shall not be regulated under this
article, and the Town shall assume no responsibility for any such
action undertaken by such lot owner.
(28) Amendments. The Planning Board may, upon application by the
owner of any parcel of land within an approved subdivision, amend
any condition of the subdivision approval as it affects that parcel.
The Planning Board may require the written agreement of all
owners of property adjoining the subject parcel or all owners of
property within the subdivision before approving the amendment.
If, in the judgment of the Planning Board, the proposed amendment
represents a significant change to the approved subdivision, the
Board shall conduct a public hearing on the amendment as
provided in this article.

ARTICLE XIII
Planned Development Districts
§ 190-65. Intent.
§ 190-66. Objectives.
In order to carry out the intent of this article, all approved PDDs shall:
A. Planned development districts (PDD) provide a procedure for allowing
flexible land use and design for parcels where the objectives of
Colonie's zoning and planning documents can be achieved by creative
planning and design. PDDs allow for development that is matched to
the unique characteristics of its site and allow for innovative
development techniques that might not otherwise be possible through
strict application of standard use, area, bulk and density specifications.
B. Approved PDDs will enable greater flexibility than conventional zoning
while providing a customized regulatory framework that recognizes the
unique environmental, physical and cultural resources of the project
area and neighborhood. PDD legislation adopted by the Town Board will
replace the existing zoning for the affected parcel or parcels and will
become the basis for detailed design, review and control of subsequent
development.
C. Planned development districts shall advance the goals of the
Comprehensive Plan; promote innovation in the design and layout of
structures and encourage compact, pedestrian-oriented development
and redevelopment; ensure adequate provision of community services;
and preserve significant natural features and permanently protect open
space resources.
D. While flexibility is encouraged, it is intended that conformance with the
Comprehensive Plan, municipal service availability and the purposes of
this chapter shall ensure that the general welfare is protected through
equal treatment under this uniform procedure. The Town Board shall
consider the health, safety and welfare of the residents, as well as the
aesthetics of all proposed project approvals.
A. Provide an adequate and integrated system of open space and
recreation areas designed to tie the PDD together internally and link it
to the larger community.
B. Preserve significant natural topography and geologic features.
C. Prevent soil erosion and uncontrolled surface water drainage.
D. Preserve and integrate historically significant structures and sites with
viable adaptive uses.
E. Use land efficiently, resulting in smaller networks of streets and utilities
and thereby lower development and maintenance costs.
§ 190-65 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-66
1:855
§ 190-67. General standards.
§ 190-68. Preliminary application.
The applicant shall have the option to provide a preliminary application to
the Planning and Economic Development Department (PEDD) before formal
application is made. The preliminary application shall be used for sketch
plan review. A conceptual plan of the proposed PDD may be submitted and
discussed with the PEDD prior to the submission of a formal application.
The preliminary application shall include:
F. If residential in land use, provide a choice in occupancy tenure (e.g.,
individual ownership, leaseholds, condominiums), type of housing (e.g.,
detached houses, townhouses, garden apartments), lot size and
community facilities available to existing and potential Town residents.
G. Use creative design and site planning of a quality that will improve the
functional relationships between buildings and uses.
H. Produce a development pattern that is consistent with the goals and
objectives of the Town.
A. Generally. In accordance with the criteria set forth below, the existing
use, dimensional, sign and parking regulations may be altered in order
to establish a planned development district; provided, however, that the
following standards are met.
B. Ownership. The tract of land for a project may be owned, leased or
controlled either by a single person or legal entity or by a group of
individuals or entities. An application must be filed by the owner or
jointly by the owners of all property included in the project. In the case
of multiple owners, the approved plan and its amendments shall be
binding on all owners or their successors in title and interest.
C. Water supply and sewage disposal. PDDs which include a significant
number of residential units shall be served by a community water
system and be provided with sewage disposal facilities in accordance
with the requirements of the Town, the County and the New York State
Departments of Health and Environmental Conservation.
D. Open space requirements. Common open space totaling not less than
35% of the total planned development district shall be provided in
perpetuity. This land shall be exclusive of any land area used primarily
for vehicular modes of transportation, including parking areas,
garages, carports and other features. A property owners' association or
similar mechanism for the long-term ownership and maintenance of this
common open space shall be provided, subject to the approval of the
Town Planning Board, and the establishment of a conservation
easement or other encumbrance to further ensure the protection of this
open space may be required.
§ 190-66 COLONIE CODE § 190-68
1:856
§ 190-69. Formal application.
After sketch plan review is complete, if a preliminary application was made,
or as the first application, a formal application for establishment of a
planned development district shall be made in writing to the Town Board.
The Town Board, if it chooses to consider the rezoning request, shall refer
the application to the Planning Board and, if necessary, to its designated
planning and engineering consultants for review and recommendation. The
formal application process shall be the same process as required for major
site plan review.
§ 190-70. Required findings.
The Planning Board shall develop written findings that document the facts
and information relied upon to reach its conclusions in rendering a decision
on a PDD. The following mandatory findings must be addressed:
A. A map identifying the boundaries and physical characteristics of the
proposed PDD.
B. A conceptual plan including a succinct narrative of the intent and
attributes of the proposed district(s) that describes the location,
conceptual design, and use of any lots and structures.
C. The proposed amount, location and use of open space.
D. Any anticipated changes in the existing topography and natural
features.
E. The location of the site with respect to nearby streets, rights-of-way,
adjacent properties, easements and other pertinent features within 200
feet.
F. The applicable fee.
A. That the PDD is consistent with the purpose and intent of this chapter
including the design standards.108
B. That the PDD is compatible with the surrounding neighborhood context
and character and is in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan.
C. That the requirements of SEQRA have been fulfilled, and the PDD has
mitigated potential undue adverse environmental impact as set forth
during SEQRA review to the maximum extent practicable.
D. That the PDD will add to the long-term assets of the community and will
not erode the livability or economic viability of existing neighboring
areas.
E. That the open space and recreation areas and facilities provided are
commensurate with the level of development proposed and the
108. Editor's Note: See Art. IX, Design Standards.
§ 190-68 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-70
1:857
§ 190-71. Town Board action.
predevelopment open space resources potentially available for
protection.
F. That the provisions to protect open space resources are sufficiently
secured by dedication where appropriate and desirable or legal
instruments and/or monitoring programs and/or establishment or use of
an existing trust to ensure their continued long-term protection.
G. That the proposal is conceptually sound in that it meets local and areawide
needs and it conforms to accepted design principles in the
proposed functional roadway and pedestrian system, land use
configuration, open space system, drainage system and scale of
elements, both absolutely and to one another.
H. That there are adequate community facilities, services and utilities
available or proposed to be made available in the construction of the
development.
I. That traffic will not have an adverse impact on the adjoining
transportation system.
A. Upon receipt of the Planning Board's findings and recommendation, the
Town Board may then consider the legal establishment of the planned
development district through a Zoning District Map amendment.
B. The Town Board, if it wishes to consider the requested amendment,
shall hold a public hearing thereon upon such notice as is required by
this chapter for a zoning amendment and applicable provisions of the
Town Law of the State of New York.

list the addresses of owners to whom notice was mailed or
personally delivered, and attach copies of all written
notices and a map showing where placards were posted.
C. The Town Board may, if it believes it necessary in order to fully protect
the health, safety and general welfare of the community, attach to its
zoning resolution additional conditions or requirements the applicant
must meet. Such requirements may include but are not limited to:
(1) Visual and acoustical screening.
(2) Modification to land-use mix.
(3) Schedule of construction of occupancy.

1:859
§ 190-72. Other provisions.
(8) Provision of or funding for significant amenities and/or open space
on or off site.
D. Site plan review. Site plan review of building projects within an
established PDD shall be the same process as required for major site
plan review. However, prior to final approval the Planning Board shall
present the application to the Town Board for its review for the purpose
of ascertaining that the finalized plans are consistent with the
conceptual plans used for the rezoning of the parcel to the PDD.
E. Subdivision review. Applications for subdivision in a Planned
Development District shall be made to the Planning Board in
accordance with this chapter. In the event of a conflict between the
Subdivision Article109 of this chapter and this article or any requirement
imposed hereunder, the provisions of this article for such requirements
shall apply.
F. Conditions to run with the land. All conditions imposed by the Town
Board, including those the performance of which are conditions
precedent to the issuance of any permit necessary for the development
of all or any part of the entire site, shall run with the land and shall
neither lapse nor be waived as a result of any subsequent change in the
tenancy or ownership of any or all of said area. Such conditions shall
further be a part of any certificate of occupancy issued for any use or
structure in such development.
G. Existing rights preserved. Any use lawfully occurring in any Planned
Development District (formerly known as Planned Unit Development) in
existence on the effective date of this chapter shall be permitted to
continue and any buildings, appurtenant structures or facilities
accommodating such uses may be renovated, repaired and maintained
without being subject to the provisions of this article, provided that any
change in use or new or additional building project shall be so subject.
Applications pending on the effective date hereto for a building project
in an existing or proposed Planned Development District shall continue
to be reviewed and acted upon by the administrative board conducting
such review and final action of such board shall be deemed to be a
recommendation to the Town Board hereunder.
A. PDD legislation repealer.
(1) The Town Board may act to return the property to its prior zoning
district classification if it finds that:
(a) Performance requirements which may have been specified by
the Town Board in its PDD approval action, such as a time limit
for either initiation or completion of improvements and other
109. Editor's Note: See Art. XII.
§ 190-71 COLONIE CODE § 190-72
1:860
construction work on the proposed development, have not
been met; unless the Town Board, upon specific application
and for good cause, authorizes an extension of such
performance requirement.
(b) The PDD approval has expired by the failure of the applicant to
make substantial and continuing progress in the development
of the project for more than three years from the date of final
approval. The determination of substantial and continuing
progress shall be determined solely by the Town Board, which
may consider any number of factors in making its
determination, including the securing of project financing and
changed market conditions.
(2) If a planned development district is repealed, any buildings
constructed or used may continue as a nonconforming use and such
shall continue to be bound by the previous PDD approval.
B. Existing PDDs grandfathered. Any planned development district
(formerly known as "planned unit development district") legally created
prior to the adoption of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect
subject to the conditions and requirements expressed in its approval by
the Town Board, unless action is taken by the Town Board to modify said

ARTICLE XIV
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control
[Amended 4-26-2007 by L.L. No. 8-2007]
§ 190-73. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
A. Development of real property and associated increases in site
impervious cover often alter the hydrologic response of local
watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes,
flooding, stream channel erosion or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of
waterborne pollutants, including more silt in aquatic habitat for fish
and other desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat. Improper clearing of vegetation and burial of
vegetative and other wastes can result in unstable soil conditions and
the production of noxious gases through decomposition of said wastes;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point-source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from real property
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint-
source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the
public interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety;
and
I. Regulation of development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 190-73 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-74
1:863
§ 190-74. Purpose.
The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management
requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health,
safety and welfare of the public residing within this jurisdiction and to
address the findings of fact above. This article seeks to meet those purposes
by achieving the following objectives:
§ 190-75. Definitions.
The terms used in this article or in documents prepared or reviewed under
this article shall have the meaning as set forth in this section. If a term is not
defined in this section, then the definition provided in Article II shall apply.
Any conflict between a definition provided in Article II and this article shall
be resolved in favor of the definition provided below.
A. Meet the requirements of Minimum Measures 4 (construction runoff)
and 5 (post-construction maintenance) of the SPDES General Permit for
Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate Stormwater Sewer
Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02, or as amended or revised;
B. Require work on real property to conform to the substantive
requirements of the New York State Department of Environmental
Conservation State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES)
General Permit for Construction Activities, GP-02-01, or as amended or
revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from activities on real
property in order to reduce flooding, silt, increases in stream
temperature and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize or decrease pollution caused by stormwater runoff from
activities on real property which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize or decrease the total annual volume of stormwater runoff
which flows from any specific site during and following development to
the maximum extent practicable;
F. Reduce or decrease stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion
and non-point-source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices, and to ensure that these management practices
are properly maintained, and eliminate threats to public safety. Specific
consideration of stormwater runoff shall be provided to critical
watersheds; and
G. Eliminate unstable soil conditions and the production of noxious gases
which result from improper stormwater practices, improper grading
practices, improper clearing of vegetation and the burial of vegetative
and other wastes.

access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and
regular maintenance.
A. Inspection.

applicant, the Town of Colonie Commissioner of Public Works or his
or her designees may require such inspections as necessary to
determine compliance with this article and may either approve that
portion of the work completed or notify the applicant wherein the
work fails to comply with the requirements of this article and the
stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as approved. To
obtain inspections, the applicant shall notify the Town of Colonie
enforcement official at least 48 hours before any of the following as
required by the Commissioner of Public Works or his or her
designees:

of Public Works or his or her designees.
B. Inspection of stormwater facilities after project completion. Inspection
programs shall be established on any reasonable basis, including but
not limited to routine inspections; random inspections; inspections
based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection
of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of
sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses
or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of
contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more
likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal
water or sediment quality standards or the SPDES stormwater permit;
and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under
environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not

property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the
purpose of inspection.

E. Construction completion guarantee. In order to ensure the full and
faithful completion of all land development activities related to
compliance with all conditions set forth by the Town of Colonie in its
approval of the stormwater pollution prevention plan, the Town may
require the applicant or developer to provide, prior to construction, a
performance bond, cash escrow or irrevocable letter of credit from an
appropriate financial or surety institution which guarantees
satisfactory completion of the project and names the Town of Colonie as
the beneficiary. The security shall be in an amount to be determined by
the Town based on submission of final design plans, with reference to
actual construction and landscaping costs. The performance guarantee
shall remain in force until the surety is released from liability by the
Town of Colonie, provided that such period shall not be less than one
year from the date of final acceptance or such other certification that
the facility(ies) have been constructed in accordance with the approved
plans and specifications and that a one-year inspection has been
conducted and the facilities have been found to be acceptable to the
Town. Per-annum interest on cash escrow deposits shall be reinvested
in the account until the surety is released from liability.

an approved financial institution or surety to ensure proper operation
and maintenance of all stormwater management and erosion control
facilities both during and after construction and until the facilities are
removed from operation. If the developer or landowner fails to properly
operate and maintain stormwater management and erosion and
sediment control facilities, the Town of Colonie may draw upon the
account to cover the costs of proper operation and maintenance,
including engineering and inspection costs.
G. Recordkeeping. The Town of Colonie may require entities subject to this
article to maintain records demonstrating compliance with this portion
of the Town of Colonie Land Use Law.

is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this
article, it may issue a written notice of violation to the landowner and

anyone else responsible for the work being performed. The notice of

in effect until the Town of Colonie confirms that the project is in
compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure
to address a stop-work order in a timely manner may result in civil,
criminal or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement
measures authorized in this article.
J. Violations. Any land development activity that is commenced or is
conducted contrary to this article may be restrained by injunction or
otherwise abated in a manner provided by law.

ARTICLE XVI
Watercourse Area Management
§ 190-86. Findings.
§ 190-87. Purpose.
It is the purpose of this article to:
A. The Town of Colonie is blessed with many miles of rivers and streams
which provide important benefits to every resident. Watercourse areas
provide much of the water we drink. They enhance our commerce and
provide other economic benefits. Aesthetically pleasing watercourse
areas add to the quality of human experience. Watercourse areas may
be pleasant to look upon, to work or rest beside or to contemplate. They
may enhance the visual scene wherever they occur, whether in cities or
in wilderness. Watercourse areas provide a variety of recreational
benefits, and they may enhance the value of adjoining properties, public
or private. A well-maintained watercourse area may provide a focal
point of pride for a community. In spite of these values, watercourse
areas are not always accorded treatment which allows them to function
properly. Many have been needlessly polluted, unwisely dammed or
insensitively channelized, thereby reducing their capability to satisfy
diverse human needs.
B. A community can reap economic and social benefits of its watercourse
areas if its watercourse areas are properly managed. Conversely, a
watercourse area can become an economic and social liability if a
community neglects a watercourse area or permits adjacent lands to be
improperly used; therefore, the Town of Colonie determines that
conservation and enhancement of the quality of its watercourse areas
and related shoreland resources is necessary and that the watercourse
corridor (watercourse and its immediate shoreland environment) is an
area of critical environmental significance which, because it is an area
which includes the watercourse and the natural and cultural resources
that are closely related to it, is the most important zone for
concentrating watercourse conservation and management efforts and
hereby adopts this article, to be known as the "Town of Colonie
Watercourse Area Management Law," to protect and manage said
resources.
A. Encourage planning and development of the natural and man-made
watercourse and adjacent lands in the Town of Colonie in ways which
will restore, protect, develop and enhance their recreational, cultural,
visual and historical amenities; that will minimize the threat to life and
destruction of property and natural resources from flooding; and that
will preserve and reestablish natural floodplain hydrologic functions.
B. Restore, protect and enhance water quality and associate aquatic
resources and water supplies.
§ 190-86 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-88
1:899
§ 190-88. Applicability.
This article shall apply to those watercourse areas which are delineated on
the Town of Colonie's map entitled "Town of Colonie Protected Watercourse
Areas," which is hereby adopted and declared to be a part of this article.
Said map is on file in the Town Clerk's office, and copies are available for
reference in the Planning and Economic Development Department.
§ 190-89. Prohibited activities.
The following activities are expressly prohibited in the designated protected
watercourse areas of the Town of Colonie:

replacement in kind of an existing structure. Encroachments by such
structures, 200 square feet or less in total area per lot, shall be
permitted if not nearer than 75 feet to the watercourse center line.
Removal of vegetation and grading in excess of six inches in depth
related to any such encroachment shall be permitted, but shall be
limited to the area within 10 feet of the encroachment.
G. Street, driveway or walkway crossings, except for replacement in kind
of an existing facility or those necessary for traffic distribution, traffic
safety or emergency access purposes or which provide access to
otherwise inaccessible parcels. Removal of vegetation, culvert piping,
bridge construction, and grading in excess of six inches in depth related
to such excepted crossings shall be permitted, but shall be limited to
the minimum necessary to construct the crossing.
H. Construction of streets, driveways or walkways other than those
specified in this article; parking areas; patios or other such surfaces
greater than 200 square feet in total ground surface area per lot, except
for replacement in kind of an existing facility. Encroachments by such
surfaces, 200 square feet or less in total area per lot, shall be permitted
if not nearer than 75 feet to the watercourse center line. Removal of
vegetation and grading in excess of six inches in depth related to any
such encroachment shall be permitted but shall be limited to the area
within 10 feet of the encroachment.

ARTICLE XVII
Floodplain Management
[Amended 1-8-2015 by L.L. No. 1-2015]

C. Interpretation and conflict with other laws. This article includes all
revisions to the National Flood Insurance Program through October 27,
1997, and shall supersede all previous laws adopted for the purpose of
flood damage prevention. In their interpretation and application, the
provisions of this article shall be held to be minimum requirements,
adopted for the promotion of the public health, safety, and welfare.
Whenever the requirements of this article are at variance with the
requirements of any other lawfully adopted rules, regulations, or
ordinances, the most restrictive, or that imposing the higher standards,
shall govern.
D. Severability. The invalidity of any section or provision of this article
shall not invalidate any other section or provision thereof.
§ 190-97 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-98
1:913
§ 190-99. Administration.
E. Penalties for noncompliance. No structure in an area of special flood
hazard shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or
altered and no land shall be excavated or filled without full compliance
with the terms of this article and any other applicable regulations. Any
infraction of the provisions of this article by failure to comply with any
of its requirements, including infractions of conditions and safeguards
established in connection with conditions of the permit, shall constitute
a violation. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with
any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined no more
than $250 or imprisoned for not more than 15 days or both. Each day of
noncompliance shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein
contained shall prevent the Town of Colonie from taking such other
lawful action as necessary to prevent or remedy an infraction. Any
structure found not compliant with the requirements of this article for
which the developer and/or owner has not applied for and received an
approved variance under § 190-101 will be declared noncompliant and
notification sent to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
F. Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations.
Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may
be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not
imply that land outside the area of special flood hazards or uses
permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood
damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the Town of
Colonie, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency
Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on
this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
A. Designation of the local administrator. The Director of the Planning and
Economic Development Department (PEDD) or his/her designee is
hereby appointed local administrator to administer and implement this
article by granting or denying floodplain development permits in
accordance with its provisions.
B. The floodplain development permit.
(1) Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for
all construction and other development to be undertaken in areas
of special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of
protecting its citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring
that new development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its
exposure to flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any
development in an area of special flood hazard, as shown on the
Flood Insurance Rate Map enumerated in § 190-98B, without a
valid floodplain development permit. Application for a permit shall
be made on forms furnished by the Director of the PEDD or his/her
designee and may include, but not be limited to: plans drawn to
§ 190-98 COLONIE CODE § 190-99

Fee Schedule, as annually adopted by the Town Board. In addition,
the applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the Town of
Colonie for any additional costs necessary for review, inspection
and approval of this project. The Director of the PEDD or his/her
designee may require a deposit of no more than $500 to cover these
additional costs.
C. Application for a permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
(1) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest
floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the Director of the
PEDD or his/her designee the as-built elevation, certified by a
licensed professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the Director of the PEDD or
his/her designee the as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a
professional engineer or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 190-100B(3),
Utilities.
(4) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any nonresidential floodproofed structure will meet the
floodproofing criteria in § 190-100D, Nonresidential structures.

1:915
capacity of the altered or relocated stream segment will be
maintained.
(6) A technical analysis, by a licensed professional engineer, if required
by the Director of the PEDD or his/her designee, which shows
whether proposed development to be located in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property.
(7) In Zone A, when no base flood elevation data are available from
other sources, base flood elevation data shall be provided by the
permit applicant for subdivision proposals and other proposed
developments (including proposals for manufactured home and
recreational vehicle parks and subdivisions) that are greater than
either 50 lots or five acres.
D. Duties and responsibilities of the local administrator. Duties of the
Director of the PEDD or his/her designee, as local administrator, shall
include, but not be limited to the following:
(1) Permit application review. The Director of the PEDD or his/her
designee shall conduct the following permit application review
before issuing a floodplain development permit:
(a) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 190-99C, Application for a permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this article.
(b) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks, to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If
a proposed building site is located in an area of special flood
hazard, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall meet the applicable standards of § 190-100, Construction
standards and, in particular, § 190-100A(1), Subdivision
proposals.
(c) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of
special flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other
property (e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood
velocities). The Director of the PEDD or his/her designee may
require the applicant to submit additional technical analyses
and data necessary to complete the determination. If the
proposed development may result in physical damage to any
other property or fails to meet the requirements of § 190-100,
Construction standards, no permit shall be issued. The
applicant may revise the application to include measures that
mitigate or eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the
application.
(d) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required
by state or federal law.

(a) When the Federal Emergency Management Agency has
designated areas of special flood hazard on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced
water surface elevation data (these areas are designated Zone
A or V on the FIRM) nor identified a floodway, the Director of
the PEDD or his/her designee shall obtain, review and
reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 190-99C(7), as criteria for requiring
that new construction, substantial improvements or other
proposed development meet the requirements of this article.
(b) When base flood elevation data are not available, the Director
of the PEDD or his/her designee may use flood information
from any other authoritative source, such as historical data, to
establish flood elevations within the areas of special flood
hazard, for the purposes of this article.
(3) Alteration of watercourses. The Director of the PEDD or his/her
designee shall:
(a) Notify adjacent communities and the New York State
Department of Environmental Conservation prior to permitting
any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit
evidence of such notification to the Regional Administrator,
Region II, Federal Emergency Management Agency.
(b) Determine that the permit holder has provided for
maintenance within the altered or relocated portion of said
watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not
diminished.
(4) Construction stage. The Director of the PEDD or his/her designee
shall:
(a) In Zones A1-A30, AE and AH, and also Zone A if base flood
elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor
or completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially
improved structure, obtain from the permit holder a
certification of the as-built elevation of the lowest floor or
floodproofed elevation, in relation to mean sea level. The
certificate shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision
of a licensed land surveyor or professional engineer and
certified by same. For manufactured homes, the permit holder
shall submit the certificate of elevation upon placement of the
structure on the site. A certificate of elevation must also be
submitted for a recreational vehicle if it remains on a site for
180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is fully licensed and
ready for highway use).
§ 190-99 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 190-99
1:917
(b) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval
of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The
Director of the PEDD or his/her designee shall review all data
submitted. Deficiencies detected shall be cause to issue a stopwork
order for the project unless immediately corrected.
(5) Inspections. The Director of the PEDD or his/her designee and/or
the developer's engineer or architect shall make periodic
inspections at appropriate times throughout the period of
construction in order to monitor compliance with permit conditions
and enable said inspector to certify, if requested, that the
development is in compliance with the requirements of the
floodplain development permit and/or any variance provisions.
(6) Stop-work orders.
(a) The Director of the PEDD or his/her designee shall issue, or
cause to be issued, a stop-work order for any floodplain
development found ongoing without a development permit.

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.

sewer connection, and it shall be the duty of said owner or
operator to make such connections and keep all occupied
MHs connected to said sewer while located in an MHP.
Sewer connections in unoccupied MHP lots shall be so
closed that they will emit no odors or cause a breeding
place for flies. No water or waste shall be allowed to fall on

premises and to inspect any records required to be kept in any
MHP.
(6) Revocation of permit. If a police officer, Building Inspector or any
authorized representative of the Town of Colonie finds that an MHP
is not being maintained in a clean and sanitary condition or is not
being conducted in accordance with the provisions of this article,
§ 190-108 COLONIE CODE § 190-108
1:940
such facts shall thereupon be reported to the Town Board, and
said Town Board may direct the Building Department to serve an
order in writing upon the holder of the permit or the person in

served upon the holder of said permit or the person in charge of
such MHP, requiring the holder of the permit to appear before the
Town Board of the Town of Colonie at a time to be specified in
such notice and show cause why such MHP permit should not be
revoked. The Town Board may, after a hearing at which testimony
of witnesses may be taken and the holder of the permit shall be
heard, revoke such permit if said Town Board shall find that said
MHP is not being maintained in a clean and sanitary condition or
if it finds that any provisions of this article have been violated or
for other sufficient cause. Upon the revocation of such permit, the
premises shall forthwith cease to be used for the purposes of an
MHP, and all MHs shall forthwith be removed therefrom.
(7) Renewal of permit. Application for the renewal of any MHP permit
issued pursuant to this article must be filed with the Building
Department on or before the first day of December next preceding

MHP is located; the name and address of the owner or owners of
such premises; the number of MH units to be provided in the
proposed MHP. Such renewal application must be accompanied by
a plan of the MHP if some change in the plan or layout of the MHP
is contemplated by the applicant. Upon the approval of said
application for a renewal of the permit by the Building Department,
the Building Department shall issue a renewal permit which shall
become effective upon the expiration of the prior permit and
continue in force for the term specified therein but in no event
longer than for a period of one year. Such renewal permit shall not
be transferred or assigned. The applicant shall, at the time of
issuance of such renewal permit, pay to the Building Department a
fee computed at a rate determined by the Town Board per MH unit
per annum, based upon the maximum number of proposed MH
units as shown in the application.

moved to a new location in the Town of Colonie, except in compliance
with the provisions of this article, and provided also that any owner or

in the same general location. The owner of an existing MH replacing
the same with a new MH shall file a plot plan with the Town Building
Department showing the dimensions of the new MH and its location
upon the building lot. The replacement MH, however, must contain
the same or a greater number of square feet of living floor space as

MH must be so situated upon the premises upon which it is located
as to comply with all provisions of the Zoning Ordinance of the Town
of Colonie relating and pertaining to front yards, rear yards and side
yards.

that, for whatever reason, fails to qualify for nonconforming status
shall:
(1) Be relocated into an MHP which complies with the provisions of
this article.
(2) Said MH unit shall immediately be removed from the Town.
(3) An extension of the time within which any such MH unit must be
relocated may be granted by the Town Building Department for a
period not to exceed one year upon documentation by the applicant
for the extension that compliance by other than relocation outside
the Town is not possible due to the fact that no MHP within the
Town which complies with the provisions of this article has a
vacancy reasonably suitable for the subject MH unit.
F. MHPs that fail to qualify for nonconforming status. All MHPs which fail
to qualify for nonconforming status for whatever reason shall be closed,

FIRST PRIZE CENTER REDEVELOPMENT OVERLAY ZONING
DISTRICT
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning and land use  See Ch. 190.
§ 191-1. Legislative purpose and intent.
A. The property, as described and/or depicted on Attachment 1,122 has
been a long vacant industrial property bisected by the municipal
borders of Town of Colonie and the City of Albany. The property
formerly housed Tobin's First Prize meat processing and packaging
facility, where meat packing activities were conducted, and has been
significantly deteriorating since its closure decades ago. Several
redevelopment opportunities have been explored over the years with no
tangible results. One of the primary reasons cited for the lack of
interest and or ability to redevelop the site is the uncertainty that
results from the property being located in two separate municipalities
and subject to two separate and complex land use approval processes.
B. Consistent with their respective Comprehensive Plans, the Town Board
of the Town of Colonie and the Common Council of the City of Albany
each desire to facilitate redevelopment of this vacant and deteriorating
property. Redevelopment, through replanning, and demolition and
reconstruction where appropriate, will promote and encourage the
elimination of blight in this area and promote economic growth.
Maximum flexibility for future redevelopment is to be encouraged.
C. City of Albany Comprehensive Plan § 3.1, which encourages ways to
make the City attractive for business development and appealing to
regional economic development practitioners, states:
[C]reation of new zoning or overlay districts, density evaluation and
adjustment to bring about desired community vision, elimination of
existing zoning districts that are obsolete or ineffective, and rezoning
of areas of the City to existing or new districts. Form-based codes
should be considered. . . and [p]romote development patterns that
include walkable streets, compact, mixed-use development, public
spaces, and context sensitivity to historic design and development.
D. Town of Colonie Comprehensive Plan § 3.3 states:
122. Editor's Note: Said attachment is on file in the Town offices.
§ 190-133 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 191-1
1:967
Many opportunities exist within the Town of Colonie to regenerate and
revitalize once vital industrial areas. Locations that are underutilized
or even unused today, such as the First Prize Center . . . could be
returned to productive use. Trying to recreate value in these areas is
consistent with the notion that the Town of Colonie cannot look at its
remaining undeveloped land for all or most of its future development
opportunities. The future revitalization of these areas should be
viewed as a critical economic development opportunity. . . Success
with this type of initiative will help the Town maintain its fiscal
balance, making it possible to fund necessary services and desired
quality of life improvements.
E. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the health, safety,
convenience and general welfare of the residents of the City and the
Town by establishing a single intermunicipal zoning district applicable
to the covered area which promotes and encourages economic
development in both municipalities through an integrated mix of
planned commercial and residential uses designed and constructed
using smart growth principles. This intermunicipal zoning district
encourages a mix of uses within multiple-story buildings and
structures, encourages a high density of building structures and uses to
create a village-like or urban setting, promotes pedestrian and other
nonvehicular access between uses and provides sufficient separation
and buffering from properties neighboring the zoning district to protect
the existing character of existing land uses surrounding the district.
F. This chapter is intended to promote intergovernmental cooperation to
increase coordination and effectiveness of comprehensive planning and
land use regulation, make more efficient use of infrastructure and
municipal revenues, as well as the enhanced protection of community
resources, especially where such resources span municipal boundaries.
G. It is the intent of this chapter to create an intermunicipal overlay zoning
district, and a set of self-contained regulations to apply to any future
redevelopment that occurs within the zoning overlay district. The City
and the Town will accomplish this vision through creation of the First
Prize Redevelopment Overlay Zoning District.
H. The requirements of this chapter are intended to be the only land use
requirements to apply within the zoning overlay district, except as
provided in this chapter, and such requirements shall supersede any
zoning requirements and other land use regulations that would
otherwise apply in the absence of this chapter. The provisions of this
chapter shall be broadly interpreted to promote the Town's and the
City's vision and goals as set forth herein, to ensure orderly
development and to satisfy the legislative intent of this chapter.
I. This chapter is adopted pursuant to, and in furtherance of, an
intermunicipal agreement between the City of Albany and Town of
Colonie, executed on the _____ day of _____, 2017 (the "Intermunicipal
Agreement").

NOTES ON DIMENSIONAL TABLE:
7. In an MFR District, a lot conforming to the minimum dimensional requirements contained in this table may be subdivided for development of single-family or two-family residences,
with lot sizes, minimum building setbacks from newly created lot lines, other area and dimensional requirements, development design, road standards, and provisions for open space
subject to review and approval by the Planning Board in accordance with the standards established for conservation subdivisions in the overlay districts article of this chapter. The
overall development density shall not exceed six units per acre, and building setbacks from the original lot lines shall conform to the minimum dimensional requirements contained in
the table.
8. Where a lot is proposed to be subdivided for development of multifamily dwellings, the allowable number of dwelling units for the entire development shall be determined by the area
of the original lot, including any part of the original lot to be set aside for public or private roadways, open space, recreation areas, or other such uses. The density on any individual lot
in such a development may exceed six units per acre, provided that the average density for the entire development does not.
9. In an OR, NCOR, COR, or HCOR District, up to 80% of the base commercial density may be converted to residential use, at a ratio of 3,000 square feet of commercial use per dwelling
unit. That is, the maximum density is 3,000 sq. ft. per dwelling unit
10. Base commercial density in an IND or ABA District shall apply to conservation development only.
11. In a CO District, the listed base residential density is restricted to those parcels which are 15 acres or greater in size. For such parcels, the overall residential density shall not exceed six
units per acre, and building setbacks from the original lot lines shall conform to the minimum dimensional requirements for the MFR District contained in the table. A rental office on
site is required for such residential development. In a CO District, only for parcels that are 15 acres or greater in size, any percentage of mixed use may be used.
