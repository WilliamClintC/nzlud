of the following conditions exist.
a. Information contained in the application, or supplemental
information requested from the applicant, is found to be false in
any detail; or
b. The applicant fails to complete the application form within five
(5) calendar days after having been notified of additional
information or documents required; or
c. Another special event permit application has been received
prior or has already been approved which schedules another
event at the same time and place requested by the applicant; or
so close in time and place as to cause undue difficulty in the
scheduling of the event; or
d. Another special event permit application has been received
prior or has already been approved which renders the police
department unable to meet the needs for police services for
both events; or
e. The time, route, or size of the event will substantially interrupt
or impair the safe and orderly movement of vehicular traffic
contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a
street during a time when such safe and orderly movement is a
matter of public safety; or
f. The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site
of the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around an
event, has the potential to impair or prevent proper police, fire,
or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the event; or
g. The size of the event will require such a concentration of police
officers to ensure the public safety, to ensure all participants
stay within the boundaries or route of the event, or to protect
participants in the event, that it will be a burden on the
CODE
72
resources of the department so as to prevent normal protection
to the remainder of the city; or
h. The parade, or other event moving along a route, will not
progress from its point of origin to its point of termination
within three hours or less; or
i. The location of the event will substantially interfere with any
construction or maintenance work, either previously scheduled
or scheduled as an emergency, which will commence upon or
along the city streets, or along any public right-of-way,
included in the route or impede construction work which has
been scheduled in connection with a previously granted
encroachment permit; or
j. The event shall occur at such time as to cause conflict with
school sessions or daily activities connected with hospitals or
emergency agencies in such a way as to cause either severe
traffic congestion and/or create a noise level which would
substantially disrupt the said activities, or would cause a
disturbance which would be detrimental to the well-being of
any patients at the hospital; or
k. The event is a parade that is scheduled to begin after the hour
of 7:00 P.M.
The above information shall also be justified for the special events
coordinator to revoke a previously issued permit.
2. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit due to public safety
concerns if reasonable conditions can be imposed which will allow for
adequate protection of event participants by use of private security or
City police officers.
3. When grounds for denial of an application for permit specified in
subsection 4-40(1a) through 4-40(1j) above can be corrected through
changing the date, time, duration, route, or location of the event, the
special events coordinator may, instead of denying the application,
conditionally approve the application contingent upon the applicant’s
acceptance of certain conditions for permit issuance. The conditions
imposed shall only provide such modifications as are necessary to
achieve compliance with subsections 4-40(1a) through 4-40(1j) above.

authorized to take appropriate action to insure the safety of the public and

assist the owner(s) in finding sources to secure the structure by
determining if the structure only needs repairing or if it is beyond the point
of repair and meets the Unsafe Building Abatement Code.

Section 7-212. Grading Inspection.
All grading operations for which a permit is required shall be subject to
inspection by the Inspection Department. When required, special inspection of
grading, operations and special testing shall be performed in accordance with
provisions of Section 7-212.2.
CODE
1. Grading Designation: All grading in excess of five thousand (5000)
cubic yards shall be performed in accordance with the approved
grading plan prepared by a civil engineer, and shall be designated as
“engineered grading”. Grading involving less than five thousand
(5000) cubic yards shall be designated “regular grading” unless the
permittee, with the approval of the Inspection Department chooses to
have the grading performed as “engineered grading”.
2. Engineered Grading Requirements: For engineered grading it shall be
the responsibility of the civil engineer who prepares the approved
grading plan to incorporate all recommendations from the soil
engineering and engineering geology reports into the grading plan.
He/she shall also be responsible for the professional inspection and
certification of the grading within his/her area of technical specialty.
This responsibility shall include, but need not be limited to, inspection
and certification as to the establishment of line, grade and drainage of
the development area. The civil engineer shall act as the coordinating
agent in the event the need arises for liaison between the other
professionals, the contractor and the Inspection Department. The civil
engineer shall also be responsible for the preparation of revised plans
and the submission of as-graded grading plans upon completion of the
work.
Soil engineering and civil engineering and geology reports shall be
required as specified in Sections 7-202 and 7-203. During grading all
necessary reports, compaction data and soil engineering and civil
engineering and geology recommendations shall be submitted to the
civil engineer and the Inspection Department by the soil engineer and
the civil engineer and geologist.
The soil engineers area of responsibility shall include, but need not be
limited to, the professional inspection and certification concerning the
preparation of ground to receive fills, testing for required compaction,
stability of all finish slopes and the design of buttress fills, where
required, incorporating data supplied by the engineering geologist.
The civil engineer’s area of responsibility shall include, but need not
be limited to, the site grading, design, and drainage.
The geologists area of responsibility shall include, but need not be
limited to, professional inspection and certification of the adequacy of
natural ground for receiving fills and the stability of cut slopes with
respect to geological matters, and the need for subdrainage or other
ground water drainage devices. He shall report his findings to the soil
engineer and the civil engineer for engineering analysis.
The Inspection Department shall inspect the project at various stages of
the work requiring certification and at any more frequent intervals
necessary to determine that adequate control is being exercised by the
CODE
professional consultants.
3. Regular Grading Requirements: The Inspection Department may
require inspection and testing by an approved testing agency.
The testing agency responsibility shall include, but need not be limited
to, certification concerning the inspection of cleared areas and benches
to receive fill, and the compaction of fills.
When the Inspection Department has cause to believe that geologic
factors may be involved, the grading operation will be required to
conform to engineered grading’ requirements.
4. Notification of Noncompliance: If, in the course of fulfilling their
responsibility under this Article, the civil engineer, the soil engineer,
the geologist or the testing agency finds that the work is not being done
in conformance with this Article or the approved grading plans, the
discrepancies shall be reported immediately in writing to the person in
charge of the grading work and to the Inspection Department.
Recommendations for corrective measures, if necessary, shall be
submitted.
5. Transfer of Responsibility for Certification: If the civil engineer, the
soil engineer, the geologist or the testing agency of record are changed
during the course of the work, the work shall be stopped until the
replacement has agreed to accept the responsibility within the area of
their technical competence for certification upon completion of the
work.

Upon completion of the rough grading work and at the final completion of the
work, the Inspection Department may require the following reports and drawings and
supplements thereto.
1. Final reports:
a. An As-Graded grading plan prepared by the civil engineer
including original ground surface elevations, as graded ground
surface elevations, lot drainage patterns and locations and
elevations of all surface and subsurface drainage facilities.
He/she shall provide certification that the work was done in
accordance with the final approved grading plan.
b. A Soil Grading Report prepared by the soil engineer including
locations and elevations of field density tests, summaries of
field and laboratory tests and other substantiating data and
comments on any changes made during grading and their effect
on the recommendations made in the soil engineering
CODE
investigation report. He/she shall provide certifications as to
the adequacy of the site for the intended use.
c. A Geologic Grading Report prepared by the geologist including
a final description of the geology of the site including any new
information disclosed during the grading and the effect of same
on recommendations incorporated in the approved grading
plan. He/she shall provide certification as to the adequacy of
the site for the intended use as affected by geologic factors.
2. Notification of Completion: The permittee or his agent shall notify the
Inspection Department when the grading operation is ready for final
inspection. Final approval shall not be given until all work including

ARTICLE 1. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE,
AND OBJECTIVES.
SECTION A. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
The Legislature of the state of Mississippi has in Title 17, Chapter 1, Mississippi Code of 1972
Annotated delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council
of the City of Laurel, Mississippi does hereby adopt the following floodplain management
regulations.
SECTION B. FINDINGS OF FACT.
(1) Laurel, Mississippi is subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and
property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the
tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions, both inside and
outside the identified Special Flood Hazard Areas, causing increases in flood heights and
velocities and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or
hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed, or otherwise
unprotected from flood damages.
SECTION C. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water
or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or
velocities;
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters;
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or
flood damage, and;
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
SECTION D. OBJECTIVES.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) To protect human life and health;
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally
undertaken at the expense of the general public;
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions;
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains;
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of
flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas, and;
(7) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood prone area.
SECTION E. METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES.
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for:
(1) Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to
water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood
heights or velocities;
(2) Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be
protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;
(3) Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective
barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters;
(4) Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood
damage, and;
(5) Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert
floodwaters or may increase flood hazards in other areas.
ARTICLE 2. DEFINITIONS.
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so
as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance it’s most
reasonable application.
A Zone is the Area of Special Flood Hazard without base flood elevations determined.

Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and
hay sheds.
Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter or
height of a building.
Any addition shall be considered new construction. If the addition is more than 50% of the

provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and AR/A Zones are SFHAs that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system or levee that is in the process of being restored to
provide a one percent chance or greater level of flood protection. After restoration is complete,
these areas will still experience residual flooding from other flooding sources.
A99 Zone is that part of the SFHA inundated by the one percent chance flood to be protected
from the one percent chance flood by a Federal flood protection system or levee under
construction, no base flood elevations are determined.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s Flood
Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined
channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where
velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one
percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. This area is also referred to as the
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA).
Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year (also called the “one percent chance flood”).
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) is the elevation shown in the Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for
Zones AE, AH, AR, AR/A, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, and VE that indicates the water surface
elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year.
Basement means any portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all
sides.

gone beyond the minimum floodplain management requirements to develop extra measures to
provide protection from flooding.
Community Flood Hazard Area (CFHA) is an area that has been determined by the Floodplain Administrator (or
other delegated, designated, or qualified community official) from available technical studies, historical information,
and other available and reliable sources, which may be subject to periodic inundation by floodwaters that can
adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. This includes areas downstream from dams.
Critical facility (also called critical action) means facilities for which the effects of even a slight
chance of flooding would be too great. The minimum floodplain of concern for critical facilities
is the 0.2 percent chance flood level. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to facilities
critical to the health and safety of the public such as: emergency operations centers, designated
public shelters, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency response
installations, vital data storage centers, power generation and water and other utilities (including
related infrastructure such as principal points of utility systems) and installations which produce,
use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste (as defined under the Clean Water Act and
other Federal statutes and regulations).
D Zone is an area in which the flood hazard is undetermined.
Dam is any artificial barrier, including appurtenant works, constructed to impound or divert
water, waste water, liquid borne materials, or solids that may flow if saturated. All structures
necessary to maintain the water level in an impoundment or to divert a stream from its course
will be considered a dam.
Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including,
but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving,
excavating, drilling operations, or storage of materials or equipment.
Dry Flood proofing means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to
structures, which reduce or eliminate flood damages to real estate or improved real estate property, water, and
sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. Structures shall be flood proofed with a minimum of 12 inches of
freeboard (more is recommended) in relation to the base flood elevation. Dry flood proofing of a pre-FIRM
residential structure that has not been substantially damaged or improved is allowed. Dry flood proofing of a post-
FIRM residential building is not allowed. Non-residential structures may be dry flood proofed in all flood zones
with the exception of the Coastal High Hazard Area or the Coastal AE Zone.
Elevated building means for insurance purposes, a non-basement building which has its lowest
elevated floor raised above ground level by foundation walls, shear walls, posts, pilings,
columns, or piers.
Elevation Certificate is a FEMA form used as a certified statement that verifies a building’s
elevation information.

It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance coverage for all insurable buildings in
that community before the effective date of the initial FIRM.
Enclosure below the Lowest Floor see “Lowest Floor.”
Encroachment means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation,
buildings, structures or development into a floodplain, which may impede or alter the flow
capacity of a floodplain.

unless there is no practicable alternative.
Executive Order 11990 (Wetlands Protection) this order requires the avoidance of adverse
impacts associated with the destruction or modification of wetlands.
Existing Construction means structures for which the “start of construction” commenced before
the date of the FIRM or January 1, 1975. Existing construction may also be referred to as
existing structures.
Existing manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the
manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum the installation of utilities, the
construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community.
Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision includes the preparation of
additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured
homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).
Fill means a deposit of earthen materials placed by artificial means.
Five-Hundred Year Flood means the flood that has a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any year. Areas subject to the 0.2 percent chance flood have a moderate risk of
flooding.
Flood or flooding means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of
normally dry land areas from:
a.) The overflow of inland or tidal waters.
b.) The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source.
c.) Mudslides which are proximately caused by flooding and are akin to a river of liquid and
flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current
of water and deposited along the path of the current.
d.) The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated
cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of
water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as flash
flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event
which results in flooding.
Flood (insurance definition) means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of two or more acres of normally dry land areas or of two or more properties (e.g. a
building and a public street) from (1) overflow of inland or tidal waters (2) unusual and rapid
accumulation or runoff of surface waters (3) mudflows caused by flooding.
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) means an official map of a community, on which FEMA
has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to
the community.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS) is the document which provides an examination, evaluation, and
determination of flood hazards and, if appropriate, corresponding water surface elevations, or an
examination, evaluation, and determination of mudslide and/or flood-related erosion hazards.
Floodplain means any land area susceptible to being inundated by flood waters from any source.
Floodplain Administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain
management regulations.
Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and
preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible,
natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans,
flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other
applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term
describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards
for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage.
Flood proofing Certificate is an official FEMA form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures in
non-Coastal High Hazard Areas as an alternative to elevating buildings to or above the base flood elevation.
Floodway See Regulatory Floodway.
Floodway fringe means that area of the special flood hazard area on either side of the regulatory
floodway.
Flood Protection Elevation is the base flood elevation plus the community freeboard. In areas
where no base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection elevation
can be historical flood elevations or base flood elevations determined and/or approved by the
floodplain administrator plus freeboard.
Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the purposes of
floodplain management.
Functionally dependent use means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is
located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port
facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, ship building
and ship repair facilities. The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, processing
functions, sales, administrative functions, or service facilities.
Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional difficulty that would
result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Board of Supervisors requires that the
variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or
financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical
handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule,
qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means
without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Hazard potential means the possible adverse incremental consequences that result from the
release of water or stored contents due to failure of a dam or mis-operation of a dam or
appurtenances. The hazard potential classification of a dam does not reflect in any way on the
current condition of a dam and its appurtenant structures (e.g. safety, structural integrity, and
flood routing capacity).
High hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure may cause loss of life, serious damage
to residential, industrial, or commercial buildings; or damage to, or disruption of, important
public utilities or transportation facilities such as major highways or railroads. Dams which meet
the statutory thresholds for regulation that are proposed for construction in established or
proposed residential, commercial, or industrial areas will be assigned this classification, unless
the applicant provides convincing evidence to the contrary
.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to
construction, next to the proposed walls of a building.
Historic Structure means any structure that is:
a.) Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the
Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as
meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;
b.) Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the
historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the
Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district;
c.) Individually listed on the State of Mississippi inventory of historic structures, or;
d.) Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic
preservation programs that have been certified by an approved state program as determined
by the Secretary of the Interior.
Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analyses means the analyses performed by a
professional engineer, registered in the state of Mississippi, in accordance with standard
engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood elevations and /or floodway
boundaries.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) coverage means under the standard flood insurance policy the cost to repair a
substantially flood damaged building that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a
substantially damaged building into compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable
mitigation measures are flood proofing (nonresidential), relocation, elevation, demolition, or any combination
thereof. All renewal and new policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, include ICC coverage.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is an official FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective Flood
Insurance Rate Maps, Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, and Flood Insurance Studies.
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA)
An amendment based on technical data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated
SFHA, was not elevated by fill (only by a natural grade elevation), and will not be inundated by the one
percent chance flood. A LOMA amends the current effective FIRM and establishes that a specific property
is not located in a SFHA.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR)
A revision based on technical data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones,
flood elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One common type of
LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has been elevated by fill
above the BFE and is, therefore, excluded from the SFHA.
Conditional Letter of Map Revision (CLOMR)
A formal review and comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
NFIP floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does not revise effective Flood Insurance Rate Maps,
Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps, or Flood Insurance Studies.
Levee means a man-made structure; usually an earthen embankment designed and constructed in accordance with
sound engineering practices to contain, control, or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from
temporary flooding.
Levee system means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such
as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accordance with sound engineering practices.
For a levee system to be recognized, the following criteria must be met. All closure devices or mechanical systems
for internal drainage, whether manual or automatic, must be operated in accordance with an officially adopted
operation manual (a copy of which must be provided to FEMA by the operator when levee or drainage system
recognition is being sought or revised). All operations must be under the jurisdiction of a Federal or State agency,
an agency created by Federal or State law, or an agency of a community participating in the NFIP.
Low hazard dam means a class of dam in which failure would at the most result in damage to agricultural land,
farm buildings (excluding residences), or minor roads.
Lowest adjacent grade means the elevation of the sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement
entryway immediately next to the structure and after the completion of construction. It does not
include earth that is placed for aesthetic or landscape reasons around a foundation wall. It does
include natural ground or properly compacted fill that comprises a component of a building’s
foundation system.
Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An
unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or
storage, in an area other than a basement, is not considered a building’s lowest floor, provided
that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation
provisions of this code.
Manufactured home (44 CFR 59.1 definition / FEMA) means a structure, transportable in one
or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a
permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term manufactured home does
not include a “recreational vehicle.”

the SFHA or an individual structure or a legally described parcel of land that has been
inadvertently included in the SFHA (i.e., no alterations of topography have occurred since the
date of the first NFIP map that showed the structure or parcel to be within the SFHA.
Map Panel Number means the four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA
on a FIRM. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix represents the
number of times the map panel has been revised.
Market value means the property value (as agreed between a willing buyer and seller),
excluding the value of land as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market
value can be established by independent certified appraisal; replacement cost depreciated by age
of building (Actual Cash Value); or adjusted assessed values.

Map (FIRM) are referenced.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to owners
of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal Government and
the private insurance industry.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) means a vertical control, corrected in 1929, used
as a reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.

construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management regulation
adopted by a community and any subsequent improvements to such structure or the addition.
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or
subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the

on or after the effective date of floodplain regulations adopted by a community.
Non-Residential means, but is not limited to; small business concerns, churches, schools, farm
buildings (including grain bins and silos), poolhouses, clubhouses, recreational buildings,
mercantile structures, agricultural and industrial structures, warehouses, and hotels and motels
with normal room rentals for less than 6 months duration.

rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into
any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the
flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow
of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream.
One Percent Flood (aka 100-Year Flood) is the flood that has a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A or V is
subject to inundation by the one percent chance flood. Over the life of a 30-year loan, there is a
26-percent chance of experiencing such a flood within the SFHA.

Regular Program means the second phase of the community’s participation in the NFIP in
which second layer coverage is available based upon risk premium rates only after FEMA has
competed a risk study for the community.
Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land
areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing
the water surface elevation more than one foot.
Repair means the reconstruction or renewal of any part of an existing building for which the
start of construction commenced on or after the effective date of a floodplain management
regulation adopted by a community and all such regulations effective at the time of permitting
must be met.
Repetitive Loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions
during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the
average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage
occurred.
Repetitive Loss Property is any insurable building for which two or more claims of more than
$1,000 were paid by the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) within any rolling 10-year
period, since 1978. At least two of the claims must be more than ten days apart but, within ten
years of each other. A RL property may or may not be currently insured by the NFIP.
Section 1316 means that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended,
which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that FEMA
finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized
public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that are intended
to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
Severe Repetitive Loss Structure means any insured property that has met at least one of the
following paid flood loss criteria since 1978, regardless of ownership:
1. Four or more separate claim payments of more than $5,000 each (including building

Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the
Coastal Barrier Resources Act P. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair,
reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means
the first placement of permanent construction of a building (including a manufactured home) on
a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of a manufactured home on a foundation.
Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling;
nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for
a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as
dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start of

chassis, transported to it site in one or more sections, and affixed to a permanent foundation; or a
travel trailer without wheels, built on a chassis and affixed to a permanent foundation, that is
regulated under the community’s floodplain management and building ordinances or laws. The
term does not include a recreational vehicle or a park trailer or other similar vehicle, except as
described in the last part of this definition, or a gas, or a liquid storage tank.
Subrogation means an action brought by FEMA when flood damages have occurred, a flood
insurance claim has been paid, and all or part of the damage can be attributed to acts or
omissions by a community or other third party.
Substantial Damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of
restoring the structure to its pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the
market value of the structure before the damage occurred. Substantial damage also means floodrelated
damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for
which the cost of repairs at the time of each flood event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25
percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred
Substantial Improvement means any combination of reconstruction, rehabilitation, or other
improvement of a structure taking place since passage of initial ordinance in which the
cumulative percentage of improvement equals or exceeds 50 percent of the current market value
of the structure before the “start of construction” of the improvement. .The costs for determining
substantial improvement include the costs of additions. This term includes structures which have
incurred repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not apply to:
a.) Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing violations of state or local existing
health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the Code Enforcement Official
and which are minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, provided that said code deficiencies
were not caused by neglect or lack of maintenance on the part of the current or previous owners or;
b.) Any alteration of a “historic structure” provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure’s
continued designation as a “historic structure.”
Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions means
manufactured home parks or subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation or
improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 percent of the value of the
streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement commenced.
Suspension means the removal, with or without probation, of a participating community from
the NFIP because the community failed to adopt and enforce the compliant floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this
ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other
certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in
violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Watercourse means any flowing body of water including a river, creek, stream, or a branch.
Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum
(NGVD) of 1929, the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, (or other datum, where
specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or
riverine areas.
Wet flood proofing means a method of construction which allows water to enter a structure in
such a way that will minimize damage to the structure and its contents. Wet flood proofing is
appropriate for functionally dependent use and uses that facilitate open space use by variance
only, structures utilized for parking or limited storage, or when all other techniques are not
technically feasible. Wet flood proofing shall not be utilized as a method to satisfy the
requirements of this ordinance for bringing substantially damaged or improved structures into
compliance. Wet flood proofing is not allowed in lieu of complying with the lowest floor
elevation requirements for new residential buildings.
X Zones (shaded) are areas of 0.2 percent chance flood that are outside of the SFHA subject to
the one percent chance flood with average depths of less than one foot, or with contributing
drainage area less than one square mile, and areas protected by certified levees from the base
flood.
X Zones (unshaded) are areas determined to be outside the 0.2 percent chance floodplain.

ARTICLE 5. PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.
SECTION A. GENERAL STANDARDS FOR ALL ZONES.
In all areas of special flood hazard the following provisions are required:
(1) New construction and substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral
movement of the structure.
(2) Manufactured homes shall be anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. Methods of
anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. Dry
stacked blocks (stacked without the use of mortar or cement to bond them together) are not to be used as an
anchor/elevation method. This standard shall be in addition to and consistent with applicable state
requirements for resisting wind forces.
(3) New construction and substantial improvements shall be constructed with materials and utility equipment
resistant to flood damage.
(4) New construction or substantial improvements shall be constructed by methods and practices that minimize
flood damage.
(5) Electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, air conditioning equipment and other service facilities shall be
designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during
conditions of flooding, such facilities shall be located a minimum of the Base Flood Elevation plus eighteen
(18) inches
(6) New and replacement water supply systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of flood
waters into the system.
(7) New and replacement sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of
flood waters into the systems and discharges from the systems into flood waters.
(8) On-site waste disposal systems shall be located and constructed to avoid impairment to them or
contamination from them during flooding.
(9) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building that is in compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance shall meet the requirements of “new construction” as contained in this
ordinance.
(10) Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to a building that is not in compliance with the
provisions of this ordinance, shall be undertaken only if said non-conformity shall meet the requirements of
“new construction” as contained in this ordinance.
(11) All gas and liquid storage tanks (both above and below ground) shall be adequately anchored to prevent
floatation, lateral movement resulting from hydrodynamic forces, and the effects of buoyancy.
(12) When new construction and substantial improvements are located in multiple flood zones or in a flood zone
with multiple base flood elevations, they shall meet the requirement for the more stringent flood zone and
the highest base flood elevation.
SECTION B. SPECIFIC STANDARDS FOR RIVERINE ZONES.
In all areas of special flood hazard designated on the community’s FIRM, where base flood elevation data have been
provided (excluding CHHA and Coastal AE Zone), as set forth in Article 3, Section B, the following provisions, in
addition to the standards of Article 5, Section A, are required:
(1) Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any residential building
(including manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to no lower than
the base flood elevation plus eighteen (18) inches. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, flood openings sufficient to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls of enclosures that are subject to flooding, shall be provided in accordance with standards of Article 5,
Section B (4).
(2) Non-Residential Construction. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial,
industrial, or non-residential building (including manufactured building) shall have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to no lower than the base flood elevation eighteen (18) inches. Buildings
located in all A Zones may, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, be flood proofed in lieu of
being elevated provided that all areas of the building below the base flood elevation (plus a minimum of
one (1) foot of freeboard are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and
use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the
effect of buoyancy. Dry flood proofing is allowed only where flood velocities are less than or equal to five
feet per second. A registered professional engineer or architect shall certify that the standards of this
subsection are satisfied. A Flood Emergency Operation Plan and an Inspection and Maintenance Plan
must be provided by the design professional for the building. Such certification shall be provided to the
Floodplain Administrator.
(3) In special flood hazard areas with base flood elevations (AE Zones) but without floodways, no
encroachments, including fill material or structures, shall be permitted unless certification by a registered
professional engineer is provided demonstrating that the cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface
elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community. The engineering
certification must be supported by technical data that conforms to standard hydraulic engineering
principles.
(4) Enclosures. New construction and substantial improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by
foundation and other exterior walls below the lowest floor shall be designed to preclude finished living
space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic
flood forces on exterior walls. Enclosed areas, including crawl spaces, shall be used solely for parking of
vehicles, building access, and storage.
a.) Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional engineer or
architect or meet or exceed the following criteria:
(i) Provide a minimum of two openings, on different sides of each enclosed area; if a structure
has more than one enclosed area below the base flood elevation, each shall have openings on
exterior walls;
(ii) The total net area of all openings shall be at least one square inch for each square foot of
enclosed area, or the openings shall be designed and the construction documents shall include
a statement that the design and installation will provide for equalization of hydrostatic flood
forces on exterior walls by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters;
(iii) The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above interior grade (which must
be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior grade);
(iv) Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices
provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions and automatically
equalize hydrostatic flood loads on exterior walls, and;
b.) Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to allow for parking of vehicles (garage door)
or limited storage of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior
door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator); and,
c.) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be finished or partitioned into separate rooms.
(5) Detached storage buildings, sheds, or other like accessory improvements, excluding detached garages,
carports, and boat houses, shall solely be used for parking of vehicles and storage. Such storage space shall
not be used for human habitation and shall be limited to storage of items that can withstand exposure to the
elements and have low flood damage potential. The storage space shall be constructed of flood resistant or
breakaway materials, and equipment and service utilities, such as electrical outlets, shall be limited to
essential lighting and other incidental uses, and must be elevated or flood proofed. Flood openings in
accordance with the standards of Article 5 Section B (4) shall also be required. These accessory structures
shall be constructed and placed on the building site so as to offer the minimum resistance to the flow of
floodwaters. Accessory improvements and other appurtenant structures shall be firmly anchored to prevent
flotation that may result in damage to other structures.
(6) Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles.
a.) All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, in existing
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or
subdivisions, in new manufactured home parks or subdivisions or in substantially improved
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, must meet all the requirements for new construction,
including elevation and anchoring and the flood openings requirements of Article 5, Section B (4).
Manufactured homes must be:
(i) Elevated on a permanent foundation to have its lowest floor elevated to no lower than the base
flood elevation, and;
(ii) Securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse,
and lateral movement.
b.) All manufactured homes placed or substantially improved, excepting manufactured homes that have
incurred substantial damage as a result of a flood, in an existing manufactured home park or
subdivision must be elevated so that:
(i) The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to no lower than the base flood
elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation support system to
resist floatation, collapse, and lateral movement, or
(ii) The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements
of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above the highest adjacent
grade and adequately anchored foundation support system to resist floatation, collapse, and
lateral movement.
c.) All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either:
(i) Be on site for fewer than 180 consecutive days and;
(ii) Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, or
(iii) Must meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation
requirements of this Article 5, Section B (6) (a) or Article 5, Section B (6) (b) (i) above.
A recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed and insured in accordance with the state of
Mississippi motor vehicle regulations, is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached additions.
(7) Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard adopted by reference in Article 3, Section B, are
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of
flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and has erosion potential, the following provisions
shall apply: *
a.) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other
developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered professional
engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood
levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge;
b.) If Article 5, Section B (7) (a) above is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements
shall comply with all applicable flood damage prevention standards of Article 5.
c.) Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing
manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured home
may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision provided the
anchoring standards of Article 5, Section A (2), and the standards of Article 5, Section B (1)
through (3) and the encroachment standards of this Article 5, Section B (7) (a), are met.
SECTION C. STANDARDS FOR STREAMS WITHOUT BASE FLOOD ELEVATIONS AND
FLOODWAYS.
When base flood elevation data and floodway data are not available in accordance with Article 3, Section A, in
Special Flood Hazard Areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements shall
be elevated or flood proofed to elevations established by the community. The following provisions in addition to the
standards of Article 5 Section A and the enclosure standards of Article 5 Section B (4) shall apply:
(1) Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including proposals for
manufactured home parks and subdivisions) greater than five lots or five acres, whichever is lesser, include
within such proposals base flood elevation data;
(2) The Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and
floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of
Article 5. When such data are available, standards of Article 5, Section B, shall apply. If data is not
available from Article 5 Section C (1) or outside sources, then the following provisions shall apply.
(3) No encroachments, including fill material or other development, shall be located within a distance of the
stream bank equal to five times the width of the stream at the top of the bank or twenty feet each side from
the top of the bank, whichever is greater, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is
provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the
occurrence of the base flood discharge. The enclosure standards of Article 5, Section B (4) shall apply.
(4) The Floodplain Administrator shall require that a single lot applicant develop the base flood elevation for
the development site, utilizing accepted engineering practices and procedures. Upon review of the
submitted data, the Administrator may accept or reject the proposed base flood elevation. When such data
is accepted, standards of Article 5, Section B, shall apply. .
(5) Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the State Coordinating Office prior to any
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. Assure that the
flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any watercourse is maintained.
(6) Require that all manufactured homes be placed or installed using methods and practices which minimize
flood damage. Manufactured homes must be elevated and anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral
movement. Dry stacked blocks (stacked without the use of mortar or cement to bond them together) are not
allowed within the Special Flood Hazard Area.
SECTION D. STANDARDS FOR SUBDIVISION PROPOSALS AND OTHER PROPOSED
DEVELOPMENT.
(1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage;
(2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water
systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage;
(3) All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards, and;
(4) Base flood elevation data shall be provided for all new subdivision proposals and other proposed
development (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than five lots or five
acres, whichever is the lesser.
SECTION E. CRITICAL FACILITIES.
Construction of new and substantially improved critical facilities shall be located outside the
limits of the special flood hazard area (one percent chance floodplain). Construction of new
critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA only if no feasible alternative site is
available and access to the facilities remains available during a 0.2 percent chance flood. Critical
facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated three feet six inches
above the base flood elevation at the site (or to the 0.2 percent chance flood elevation whichever
is greater). Flood proofing and sealing measures must be implemented to ensure that toxic
substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Multiple access routes, elevated
to or above the 0.2 percent flood elevation, shall be provided to all critical facilities to the
maximum extent possible. Critical facilities must not only be protected to or above the 0.2
percent chance flood, but must remain operable during such an event. The community’s flood
response plan must list facilities considered critical in a flood, since loss of access can cause a
critical situation. Other facilities in low risk flood zones that may also be needed to support
flood response efforts must be included on the critical facility list. The use of any structure shall
not be changed to a critical facility, where such a change in use will render the new critical
facility out of conformance with this section. The list of the operators of the critical facilities
affected by flooding must be updated at least annually, as part of the community critical facility
planning procedures.
ARTICLE 6. VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
SECTION A. DESIGNATION OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
The Building Board of Adjustments and Appeals of the City of Laurel, Mississippi shall hear and decide appeals and
requests for variances from requirements of this ordinance.
SECTION B. DUTIES OF VARIANCE AND APPEALS BOARD.
The board shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or determination is
made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this ordinance. Any person aggrieved
by the decision of the board may appeal such decision to the Board of Supervisors as provided in Mississippi Code
Annotated, § 11-51-75 (1972).
SECTION C. VARIANCE PROCEDURES.
In passing upon such applications, the Planning Commission shall consider all technical evaluations, relevant
factors, and standards specified in other sections of this ordinance, and:
(1) The evaluation must be based on the characteristics unique to that property and not be shared by adjacent
parcels. The characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or its owners;
(2) Variances should never be granted for multiple lots, phases of subdivisions, or entire subdivisions;
(3) The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
(4) The danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
(5) The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on
the individual owner and the community;
(6) The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
(7) The necessity of the facility to be at a waterfront location, where applicable;
(8) The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion
damage;
(9) The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
(10) The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that
area;
(11) The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
(12) The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects
of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site, and;
(13) The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and
repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges
and culverts.
(14) Upon consideration of factors listed above, and the purpose of this ordinance, the Planning Commission may
attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this
ordinance.
(15) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base
flood discharge would result.
SECTION D. CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES.
(1) Variances shall only be issued when there is:
a.) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
b.) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, and;
c.) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional
threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict
with existing local laws or ordinances.
(2) The provisions of this ordinance are minimum standards for flood loss reduction; therefore any deviation
from the standards must be weighed carefully. Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary deviation from the requirements of this ordinance, considering the flood
hazard, to afford relief. In the instance of a Historic Structure, a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building.(See Article 6,
Section F.)
(3) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference
between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that
the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest
floor elevation.
(4) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to
the Federal Emergency Management Agency and Mississippi Emergency Management Agency upon
request. (See Article 6 Section E.)
(5) Upon consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this ordinance, the Planning
Commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the
purposes of this ordinance.
(6) Variances shall not be issued “after the fact.”
SECTION E. VARIANCE NOTIFICATION.
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official
that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased
premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage, and;
(2) Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall
be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the Chancery Clerk and shall be recorded in a
manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land.
The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance,
and report such variances issued in the community’s biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency.
SECTION F. HISTORIC STRUCTURES.
Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of “historic structures” only upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure’s continued designation as a “historic structure” and
the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure.
SECTION G. SPECIAL CONDITIONS.
Upon consideration of the factors listed in Article 6, and the purposes of this ordinance, the Building Board of
Adjustments and Appeals and/or City Council of the City of Laurel, Mississippi may attach such conditions to the
granting of variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this ordinance.
SECTION H. FLOODWAY.
Variances shall not be issued within any designated regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the
base flood discharge would result.
ARTICLE 7. SEVERABILITY.
If any section, clause, sentence, or phrase of the Ordinance is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by any court of
competent jurisdiction, then said holding shall in no way effect the validity of the remaining portions of this
Ordinance.
This ordinance having first been reduced to writing was adopted at a public meeting of the City Council of the City
of Laurel, Mississippi on February 21, 2017, and shall take effect thirty (30) days after the passage of the second
reading of said ordinance. Second reading was held on March 7, 2017 and was approved.

CHAPTER 9.2
REGULATION OF STORMWATER
DETENTION?
Section 9.2-1. Purpose.
Realizing that development is crucial to the promotion of industry and jobs,
business and commerce, housing, and private and public revenue, it is hereby
important to prevent future drainage problems which waste private and public
resources when the situation can be controlled through measures which will not
make the cost of development prohibitive.
Therefore, the purpose of this Ordinance is to diminish threats to public
health and safety caused by the runoff of excessive stormwater; reduce economic
losses to individuals and the community at large; and protect, conserve and promote
the orderly development of land and water resources. Its purpose is also to establish
administrative and enforcement procedures to evaluate and regulate on a case-bycase
basis the impact that proposed developments of all types have to stormwater
run-off on that development and on surrounding areas and to require, if needed, that
all proposed developments provide for adequate stormwater retention and detention.
The provisions of this Ordinance further regulate, guide and control:
a. The subdivision layout, redevelopment, and improvement of lands
located within the City of Laurel;
b. The construction of buildings and drainage of the sites on which
structures are located, including parking and other paved areas; and,
c. The design, construction and maintenance of stormwater drainage
facilities and systems.

Sec. 10-44. General Criteria
A. Installation requirements: All existing, proposed, or newly remodeled Food Service
Facilities inside the City of Laurel, Mississippi, wastewater service area shall be required
to install, at the user’s expense, an approved, properly operated and maintained grease
trap.
B. Sanitary sewer flows: Sanitary sewer flows from toilets, urinals lavatories, etc. shall not
be discharged into the grease trap. These flows shall be conveyed separately to the
sanitary sewer service lateral.
C. Floor drains: Only floor drains which discharge or have the
potential to discharge grease shall be connected to a grease trap.
D. Garbage grinders/disposals: It is recommended that solid food waste products be
disposed of through normal solid waste/garbage disposal means. If a grinder/disposal
issued it must be connected to the grease trap. The use of grinders is discouraged since it
decreases the operational capacity of the grease trap and will require an increased
pumping frequency to ensure continuous and effective operation.
E Dishwasher: Commercial dishwashers must be connected to the grease trap. Dishwashers
discharge soap and hot water which can melt grease and allow it to pass through an
undersized grease trap. Traps must be sized accordingly to allow enough detention time
to allow water to cool grease to solidify and float to the top of the trap.
F. Location: Grease trap shall be installed outside the building upstream from the sanitary
sewer service lateral connection. This will allow easy access for inspection, cleaning,
and removal of the intercepted grease at any time. A grease trap may not be installed
inside any part of a building without written approval by the City Plumbing Inspector.
G. Pass Through Limits: No user shall allow wastewater discharge concentration from
grease trap to exceed 100MGPL (milligrams per liter) as identified by EPA method 413.
H. A minimum 12’ X 12” dumpster pad with 6” (six inches) curb sloped to 3” (three inches)
drain, slick finished, for garbage and grease receptacle is required. Both hot and cold
water is required at the dumpster pad. The drain for the dumpster pad shall be routed
through the required grease trap. These dumpsters must be maintained as to prevent
obnoxious odors and the infestations of flies and larvae.
I. A 3–compartment sink with drain board on each side is required. Individual
compartments must be protected from the possibility of cross contamination.
J. A hand washing sink and floor mounted mop sink are required for FOG establishments.
K. Food service operations that involve frying, grilling, baking, or
barbequing or any other operation that produces considerable amounts of grease require
suppression hoods per the International Mechanical Code, 2012 Edition as
adopted and amended accordingly by the city administration.
L. Positive air pressure flow must be provided in the seating areas of the FOG
establishments per the International Mechanical Code, 2012 Edition as adopted and
amended accordingly by the city administration
M. All food service operations shall conform to the applications for special and indirect
wastes per the International Plumbing Code, 2012 Edition as adopted and amended
accordingly by the city administration.
N. All facilities shall comply with the bathroom facilities per the International Building
Code, 2012 Edition as adopted and amended. These facilities will also be required to meet
A.D.A. accessibility for restrooms, parking, and other accessibility.
O. The number of parking spaces are determined per zoning requirements.

Section 10-45. Design Criteria
A. Construction: Grease traps shall be constructed in accordance with the City of
Laurel, Mississippi standards and shall have a minimum of two compartments
with fittings designed for grease retention.
B. Access: Access to grease traps shall be available at all times for their
maintenance and inspection. Access manholes, with a minimum diameter of 24
inches, shall be provided over each grease interceptor chamber and sanitary tee.
The access manholes shall extend at least to finished grade and be designed and
maintained to prevent water inflow or infiltration. The manholes shall also have
readily removable covers to facilitate inspection, grease removal, and
wastewater sampling activities.
C. Load-Bearing Capacity: In areas where additional weight loads may exist, the
grease trap shall be designed to have adequate load-bearing capacity. (Example:
vehicular traffic in driving and parking areas)
D. Inlet and Outlet Piping: Wastewater discharging to a grease trap shall enter only
through the inlet pipe of the trap. Each grease trap shall have only one inlet and
one outlet pipe.
E. Grease Trap Sizing: The required size of the grease trap shall be calculated
using EPA-2 model. All grease traps shall have a capacity of not less than 1,000
gallons nor exceed a capacity of 3,000 gallons. If the calculated capacity
exceeds 3,000 gallons, multiple units plumbed in series shall be installed.

Section 10-46. Grease Trap Maintenance
A. Cleaning/Pumping: The user at the use’s expense shall maintain all grease traps
to assure proper operation and efficiency and maintain compliance with the
city’s Pass Through Limits. Maintenance of grease trap shall include the
complete removal of all contents, including floating materials, wastewater, and
bottom sludge and solids. This work shall be performed by a qualified and
licensed hauler. Decanting or discharging of removed waste back into the trap
from which it was removed or any other grease trap, of the purpose of reducing
the volume to be disposed, is prohibited. This service shall also include a
thorough inspection of the trap and its components. Any needed repairs shall be
noted. Repairs shall be made at the user’s expense.
B. Cleaning/Pumping Frequency: The grease trap must be pumped out completely
a minimum of once every four (45) months, or more frequently, to prevent carry
over of grease into the city’s sanitary sewer system.
C. Disposal: All waste removed from each grease trap must be disposed of at a
facility approved to receive such waste in accordance with the provisions of this
program. In no way shall the pumpage be returned to any private or public
portion of the city’s sanitary sewer collection system. All pumpage from grease
traps must be tracked by a manifest, which confirms pumping, hauling, and
disposal of waste. The customer must obtain and retain a copy of the original
manifest from the hauler.
D. A grease trap cleaning/maintenance log indicating each pumping for the
previous 24 months shall be maintained by each Food Service Facility. This log
shall include the date, time, amount pumped, hauler, and disposal site and shall
be kept in a conspicuous location for inspection. Said log shall be made
available to the City Plumbing Inspector and/or his/her representative upon
request.
E. Submittal of Records: Each user shall submit all cleaning maintenance records
to the City of Laurel Water Department. The maintenance records shall include
the following information:
1. Facility name, address, contact person, and phone number;
2. Company name, address, phone number and contact name of person
responsible for performing the maintenance, cleaning, pumping, or
repair of grease trap.
3. Types of maintenance performed
4. Dates maintenance was performed
5. Date of next scheduled maintenance
6. Copies of manifests
The City of Laurel Water Department and/or City Plumbing Inspector will perform periodic
inspections of these facilities and shall notify the user of any additional required maintenance or
repairs. Upon written notification the user shall be required to perform the maintenance and provide
records of said maintenance within 14 calendar days. Upon inspection the user may be required to
install, at his expense, additional controls to provide a complete system which prevents discharges of
undesirable materials into the wastewater collection system.

Section 10-47. Enforcement
A. Representatives of the City of Laurel, Mississippi may sample a user’s facility at any
time. It shall be unlawful for a user to refuse to allow the City Plumbing Inspector
and/or his/her designee to enter the user’s premises during business hours to determine
whether the user is complying with all the use requirements of this Article. A user
shall allow the City Plumbing Inspector and/or his/her designee to all parts of the
premises for the performance of all other duties. If the results of the sampling indicate
that the grease trap is not in compliance with this Ordinance, or if the user has not
timely submitted a manifest or other report as required by this Ordinance, the user shall
be required to pay for the sampling done under this section.
B. Except at provided herein, for a period of one year following adoption of this Ordinance,
although grease traps shall be required to be installed, no enforcement actions will be
taken under this Ordinance for failure to achieve limits on grease discharges from the
facility. If, during this one year period, an obstruction of a sewer main(s) occurs that
causes a sewer overflow to the extent that an impact on the environment is realized and
that said overflow or failure of the sanitary sewer collection system to convey sewage
can be attributed in part or in whole to an accumulation of grease in the sewer main(s)
the City of Laurel, Mississippi shall take appropriate enforcement action.

same, who makes application for a Certificate of Appropriateness under this
Chapter.
Building: Any building or other structure built for shelter or enclosure of
persons, animals or chattels, including fences, signs, paving and boundary walls,
and any part of any such building or structure when subdivided by division walls
or party walls extending to or above the roof and without openings in such
separate walls. The term “building” shall be construed as if followed by the
words “or any part thereof.”
Certificate of Appropriateness: A document evidencing the approval of
the Commission for work proposed by an applicant.
City: The City of Laurel as represented by its local governing board. For
all intents and purposes of this Chapter, the terms “City” and “Board” shall be
interchangeable.

Chapter, pursuant to §39-13-5 Mississippi Code (1978).
Construction: The erection of any on-site improvement to a landmark or
to a building or any parcel of ground located within a historic district or on a
landmark site, whether the site is presently improved or unimproved, or hereafter
becomes unimproved by “demolition”, “demolition by neglect” or as a result of
destruction of an improvement located thereon by fire, windstorm or other
CODE
243
casualty, or otherwise.
Demolition: The complete or constructive removal of a building on any
site.
Demolition by neglect: Neglect in the maintenance of any building or
structure which is a historic landmark or which is within a historic district which
results in deterioration.
Earthworks: Any subsurface remains of historical, archaeological or
architectural importance or any unusual ground formations of archaeological
significance.
Exterior features: The architectural style, general design and general
arrangement of the exterior of a building or other structure, including the color,
the kind and texture of the building material and the type and style of all windows,
doors, light fixtures, signs and other appurtenant fixtures and natural features such
as live trees.
(a) In the case of outdoor advertising signs, “exterior features” shall be
construed to mean the style, material, size, color, and location of
all such signs.
(b) Live trees larger than six (6) inches in diameter at a point five (5)
feet above the ground should be considered as exterior features.
Historic district: An area, designated by the Commission and approved by
the City through an Ordinance, which contains a geographically definable area,
urban or rural, possessing a significant concentration, linkage or continuity of
sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or aesthetically by plan
or physical development.
Historic resources: As recognized by the National Register of Historic
Places, historic resources consist of separate and aggregate buildings, districts,
structures, sites and objects, and are defined below:
(a) Building: A structure created to shelter any form of human
activity, such as a house, barn, church, hotel or similar structure.
Buildings may refer to a historically related complex such as a
courthouse and jail or a house and barn.
(b) District: A geographically definable area, urban or rural,
CODE
244
possessing a significant concentration, linkage or continuity of
sites, buildings, structures, or objects united by past events or
aesthetically by plan or physical development.
(c) Structure: A work made up of interdependent and interrelated
parts in a definite pattern of organization. Constructed by man, it
is often an engineering project large in scale. Examples: bridges,
lighthouse, water towers.
(d) Object: A material thing of functional, aesthetic, cultural,
historical or scientific value that may be, by nature or design,
movable yet related to a specific setting or environment.
Examples: steamboats, dredges.
(e) Site: The location of a significant event, a prehistoric or historic
occupation or activity, or a building or structure, whether standing,
ruined or vanished, where the location itself maintains historical or
archaeological value regardless of the value of an existing
structure. Example: battlefields, Indian mounds.
For the intents and purposes of this Chapter, the definition of a National Register
District corresponds as a “historic district”; building, structure or object
corresponds as a “landmark site.”
Landmark: An improved parcel of ground with a building, structure or
object, designated by the Commission and approved by the City through an
Ordinance, which possesses particular historic, architectural or cultural
significance by meeting at least one (1) of the following criteria:
(a) Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or
social history of the nation, State, County or City; or
(b) Is identified with historic personages or with important events in
national, State or local history; or
(c) Embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or
is a specimen inherently valuable for the study of a period style,
method of construction or use of indigenous materials or
craftsmanship; or
(d) Is representative of the notable work of a master builder, designer
or architect whose individual ability has been recognized or who
CODE
245
influenced his age.
Landmark site: An unimproved or improved parcel of ground, designated
by the Commission and approved by the City through an Ordinance, which
possesses particular historic, architectural or archaeological significance by
meeting at least one (1) of the following criteria:
(a) Exemplifies or reflects the broad cultural, political, economic or
social history of the nation, region, State, County or City; or
(b) Is identified with historic personages or with important events in
national, regional, State or local history; or
(c) Embodies distinguishing characteristics of an architectural type or
is a specimen inherently valuable for the study of a period, style,
method of construction or use of indigenous materials or
craftsmanship; or
(d) Has yielded, or may be likely to yield, information important in
prehistory or history.
“Landmark sites” differ from “landmarks” in that the physical location, not the
building or structure, possesses primary significance. Although some of the
criteria for “landmark sites” parallel the criteria for “landmarks”, “landmark sites”
which are accompanied by buildings or structures which do or do not possess
significance related to the site, may appear eligible as “landmarks” but must be
classified as “landmark sites”. For the purpose of this Chapter, therefore,
“landmark sites” encompasses prehistoric or historic sites on unimproved or
improved parcels of land.
Local Governing Board (abbreviated as “Board”): The duly elected or
appointed foremost authority of the City, including but not limited to the Mayor,
City Council. For all intents and purposes of this Chapter, the terms “Board” and
“City” shall be interchangeable.
Ordinary repairs or maintenance: Work done to prevent deterioration of
a building or any part thereof by restoring the building as nearly as practicable to
its condition prior to such deterioration, decay or damage.
Owner of record: The owner of a historic resource reflected on the current
County Tax Roll.

Section 10.1-7. Non-Restrictive Clause.
Nothing in this Chapter shall be construed to prevent the regulation or
acquisition of historic buildings, structures, sites, areas or objects owned by the
State of Mississippi or any of its political subdivisions, agencies or
instrumentalities.
Furthermore, the Mississippi State Antiquities Act provides for the
sensitive treatment of publicly owned buildings shown to possess certain
architectural, historical or archaeological significance, and so designated by the
Board of Trustees of the Mississippi Department of Archives and History as
Mississippi Landmarks. Whenever a Mississippi Landmark is proposed for
rehabilitation, alteration, enlargement, etc., the Governing Board (City Council,
Board of Supervisors, etc.) submit their plans to the Mississippi Department of
Archives and History (the “Department”) for review and compliance. If the
Department perceives the plans to be detrimental to the Mississippi Landmark, the
Department will work with the governing body to bring the project into agreement
with the secretary's standards. In this manner, local Governing Boards that have
designated publicly owned properties as landmarks, or within a historic district,
may be assured that these Mississippi Landmarks will be maintained in a manner
compatible with the secretary's standards, which is used as a rehabilitative
guideline for all designated historic districts and landmarks.

districts, landmarks and landmark sites, the findings collected in a
cohesive printed format, made a matter of public record, and made
available for public inspection.
(b) After investigation, if the Commission shall decide to recommend
the designation of a historic district or landmark or landmark site,
it shall prepare or cause to be prepared a proposed Ordinance to
make such designation.
(c) The Commission's recommendations to the City for designation of
a historic district shall be accompanied by complete
documentation, including, but not limited to:
(1) A concise description of the extant historic resources in the
district, offering a description of building types and
architectural styles represented;
(2) A concise statement of the district's historical significance;
(3) Boundary description and justification;
(4) An inventory of all the buildings, with each building
evaluated for its significance to the district;
(5) A map showing all historic resources in the district; and
(6) Photographs of typical streets capes in the districts as well
as of major types, of contributing and noncontributing
buildings.
(d) No historical district or districts shall be designated until the
CODE
251
Mississippi Department of Archives and History, acting through
such agent or employee as may be designated by its Director, shall
have made an analysis of and recommendations, concerning the
proposed district boundaries. Failure of the Department to submit
its analysis and recommendations to the City within sixty (60) days
after a written request for such analysis has been mailed to it shall
relieve the City of any responsibility of awaiting such analysis; and
the City may at, any time thereafter take any necessary action to
adopt or amend its Ordinance.
(e) If a proposed Ordinance is to designate a landmark site, it may be
presented to the City with a recommendation that it be adopted
without submission to the Mississippi Department of Archives and
History.
(f) A public hearing will be had after notice, specifying the boundaries
of any proposed historic district and the location of proposed
landmarks and landmark sites. Said notice shall be published once
a week for at least three (3) consecutive weeks in at least one (1)
newspaper published in the City. If a newspaper is not published
in the City, then the notice shall be published in a paper published
in the County. The first publication of such resolution shall be
made not less than twenty-one (21) days prior to the date fixed in
such resolution for the public hearing and the last publication shall
be made not more than seven (7) days prior to such date.
Furthermore, a copy of said notice shall be mailed by first class,
postage prepaid, to every property owner, as shown on the City Tax
Assessment Rolls, whose property is proposed to be included
within an historic district or to be designated a landmark or
landmark site. This notice shall be mailed to the addresses shown
for said property owners on said City Tax Assessment Rolls and
shall be mailed at least fifteen (15) days before said hearing. A
failure to receive a mailed notice shall not invalidate the actions of
the City taken as a result of said hearing.
(g) Within sixty (60) calendar days after the public hearing held in
connection herewith, the City shall adopt the Ordinance as
proposed, reject it entirely or adopt the Ordinance with
modifications wherein any modifications shall only be to reduce
the scope of the Ordinance as published.
(h) Furthermore, the Commission shall notify, as soon as is reasonably
CODE
252
possible, appropriate State, County, and municipal agencies of the
official designation of all landmarks, landmark sites and historic
districts. An updated list and map shall be maintained by such
agencies and made available to the public.

Section 10.1-10. Certificates of Appropriateness.
In order to promote the general welfare through the preservation and
protection of historic resources, no exterior feature of any landmark, landmark site
or building or structure within a historic district (including, but not limited to,
walls, fences, or structure within a historic district) (including, but not limited to,
walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, pavement, trees or other appurtenant features)
or any aboveground utility structure, or any type of outdoor advertising sign, shall
be erected, altered, reconstructed, restored or rehabilitated, moved, cut or
demolished within any such historic district or on any such landmark site or as to
any landmark until after an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness of
such work has been submitted to and reviewed by the Commission and approved
by the City. Therefore:
(a) The Commission shall serve as a review body with the power to
review and recommend to the City whether applications for
Certificates of Appropriateness should be granted or denied and, if
granted, what conditions, if any, should be provided in such
Certificate. The City may impose conditions not recommended by
the Commission.
(b) In making determinations, evaluations and decisions under this
Section, the Commission and City shall seek to accomplish the
purposes of this Section; in particular, to preserve and protect the
architectural and historic integrity and character of any landmark
site, landmark or historic district.
(c) A Certificate of Appropriateness shall not be required for ordinary
maintenance or repair of any landmark, or building or structure
upon a landmark site or within a historic district which does not
involve a change in design, material, color or other appearance
thereof.
(d) All decisions of the Commission shall be in writing and shall state
the findings of the Commission, its recommendations and the
CODE
253
reasons thereof.
(e) The Commission shall not recommend disapproval of any plans
without giving its recommendations for changes to be made before
such plans can be reconsidered. These recommendations may be in
general terms, and compliance therewith shall not ipso facto
qualify such plans for approval only for reconsideration by the
Commission.

Section 10.1-11. Disqualification of Members by Conflict of Interests.
Because the City may possess few residents with experience in the
individual fields of history, architecture, architectural history, archaeology, urban
planning, law or real estate, and in order not to impair such residents from
practicing their trade for hire, members of the Commission are allowed to contract
their services to an applicant for a Certificate of Appropriateness, and when doing
so, must disqualify themselves from the Commission for that application. In such
cases, the City shall, upon the request of the Chairman of the Commission or the
Vice-Chairman in his stead, appoint a substitute member who is qualified in the
same field as the disqualified member, and who will serve for that particular case
only.
If no qualified resident of the City is able to substitute for the disqualified
member, the City may appoint, in this case only, a qualified substitute who is a
resident of Mississippi but not a resident of Laurel.
If any member of the Commission must be disqualified due to a conflict of
interest more than twice in one (1) year, the Chairman, or the Vice-Chairman is
his stead, shall encourage the member to resign his Commission seat. Failing this
resignation, and if the Commission member continues to enter into conflicts of
interest with the Commission, the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman of the
Commission shall encourage the City to replace the member.
Likewise, any member of the Commission who has an interest in the
property in question or in property within three hundred (300) feet of the site in
question, or who is employed with a firm that has been hired to aid the applicant
in any matter whatsoever, or who has any proprietary, tenancy or personal interest
in any case to be considered by the Commission, shall be disqualified from
participating in the consideration of any request for a permit. In such cases, a
qualified substitute shall be appointed as provided above.

(10) The relationship of the above factors to, and their effect
upon, the immediate surroundings and, if within a historic
district, upon the district as a whole and its architectural
and historical character and integrity.
(b) New construction (additions to existing resources and infill
CODE
255
construction on vacant properties):
(1) The following aspects of new construction shall be visually
compatible with the buildings and environment with which
the new construction is visually related, vis-a-vis, the
height, the gross volume, the proportion between width and
height of the facade(s), the proportions and relationship
between doors and windows, the rhythm of solids to voids
created by openings in the facade, and materials used in the
facade, the texture inherent in the facade, the colors, pattern
and trim used in the facade, and the design of the roof.
(2) Existing rhythm created by existing building masses and
spaces between them should be preserved.
(3) The landscape plan should be sensitive to the individual
building and its occupant and needs, and should be visually
compatible with the buildings and environment with which
it is visually related.
(4) A new street facade should blend directionally with other
buildings with which it is visually related which is to say,
when adjacent buildings have a dominant horizontal or
vertical expression, that expression should be carried over
in the new facade.
(5) New construction must be compatible with the original
construction of the historic resources, and should be
distinguishable from the original construction and should
enhance the architectural characteristic of the historic
district.
(6) No single architectural style shall be imposed.
(7) The quality and excellence in design should be major
determinants.
(c) Exterior alteration:
(1) All exterior alterations to a building or structure should be
compatible with the building itself and other buildings with
which it is related, as is provided in subsection (b)(l) above,
CODE
256
and in applying these standards, an original design of the
building or structure must be considered.
(2) Exterior alterations shall not affect the architectural
character or historic quality of the building.
(d) Signs:
(1) The scale and design of any sign should be compatible with
the building and environment with which it is related.
(2) The materials, style, size, color and patterns used in any
sign should be compatible with the buildings and
environment with which it is related.
(e) Demolition. In considering an application for the demolition of a
landmark or a resource within a historic district, the following shall
be considered:
(1) The individual historical or architectural significance of the
resource.
(2) The importance or contribution of the resource to the
aesthetics of the district.
(3) The difficulty or impossibility of reproducing such a
resource because of its texture, design, material or detail.
(4) The proposed replacement structure and the future
utilization of the site.
(f) Reconstruction. The reconstruction of a building destroyed by fire,
storm or other act of God shall be governed by the provisions of
the Zoning Ordinance, except that the Commission shall regulate
the exterior design of such building in accordance with the criteria
set forth in subsection (c) above.
(g) Denial of application. An application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall only be denied upon a determination that the
proposed changes or project would:
(1) Result in such disharmony of scale, materials, massing,
CODE
257
spacing and/or style between the proposed project and its
immediate surroundings and the historic district, landmark
or landmark site as a whole so as to undermine the
architectural integrity and character of the historic district,
or landmark site or landmark, and inhibit the
accomplishment of the purposes of this Section; or
(2) Result in such a change in the architectural design or
character of an existing building or improvement so as to
undermine the architectural integrity or character of a
historic district as a whole and inhibit the accomplishment
of the purposes of this Section; or
(3) Result in the loss of or irreparable harm to an existing
building or improvement of architectural or historical
significance. A Certificate of Appropriateness should not
be denied if that denial would jeopardize the owner's
legitimate right to earn a reasonable return from his
investment in the landmark, landmark site or resource
located within the historic district. Reasonable return from
investments shall be decided and agreed upon by the owner
and the Commission.
(h) Stay of demolition. If an application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness is for the demolition of a resource within a
historic district, or a landmark or landmark site, action upon such
application shall be stayed for a period of one hundred eighty (180)
days, during which time the Commission and the applicant shall
undertake meetings and continuing discussions for the purpose of
finding a method to save such property. During such period, the
applicant and the Commission shall cooperate in attempting to
avoid demolition of the property. At the end of said one hundred
eighty (180) day period, the Commission shall meet again to
discuss the application and if no mutually agreeable method of
saving the property bearing a reasonable prospect of eventual
success is underway, or if no formal application for funds from any
governmental unit or nonprofit organization to preserve the
property is pending, the Commission shall notify the City, and the
Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee,
upon written notice of the City, may, but is not required to, issue a
permit for demolition without a Certificate of Appropriateness
having been issued.

(b) If the Commission makes a preliminary determination that a
building or structure which is a landmark or is located within a
historic district is being demolished by neglect, it shall direct the
Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee to
notify the owner or owners of the resource of this preliminary
determination, stating the reasons therefor, and shall give the
record owner or owners thirty (30) days from the date of mailing
such notice or the posting thereof on the property, whichever
comes later, to commence work to correct the specific defects as
determined by the Commission. Said notice shall be given as
follows:
(1) By certified mail, restricted delivery, mailed to the last
known address of the record owner or owners as listed on
the County Tax Rolls; or
(2) If the above mailing procedure is not successful, notice
shall be posted in a conspicuous, protected place on the
resource involved.
(c) If the owner or owners fail to commence work within the time
allotted as evidenced by a building permit, the Commission shall
notify the owner or owners in the manner provided above to appear
at a public hearing before the Commission at a date, time and place
CODE
260
to be specified in said notice, which shall be mailed or posted at
least thirty (30) days before said hearing. For the purpose of
ensuring lawful notice, a hearing may be continued to a new date
and time. The Commission shall receive evidence on the issue of
whether the subject resource should be repaired and the owner or
owners may present evidence in rebuttal thereto. If, after such
hearing, the Commission shall determine that the resource is being
demolished by neglect, it may direct the Building Inspector and/or
the Inspection Department’s designee to bring misdemeanor
charges against the owner or owners if the necessary repairs are not
completed within sixty (60) days of the determination by the
Commission that the subject building or structure is being
demolished by neglect.

Section 10.1-14. Public Safety Exclusion.
None of the provisions of this Chapter shall be construed to prevent any
measure of construction, alteration, or demolition necessary to correct or abate the
unsafe or dangerous condition of any resource, other feature or part thereof, where
such condition has been declared unsafe or dangerous by the Building Inspector
and/or the Inspection Department’s designee or the Fire Department and where
the proposed measures have been declared necessary, by such authorities, to
correct the said condition; provided, however, that only such work as is
reasonably necessary to correct the unsafe or dangerous condition may be
performed pursuant to this Section. In the event any structure or other feature
shall be damaged by fire or other calamity, or by Act of God or by the public
enemy, to such an extent that in the opinion of the aforesaid authorities it cannot
reasonably be repaired and restored, it may be removed in conformity with normal
permit procedures and applicable laws.

Section 10.1-16. Procedures for Issuance of Certificates of Appropriateness.
Anyone desiring to take action requiring a Certificate of Appropriateness
concerning a landmark, landmark site or resource within a historic district for
which a permit, variance or other authorization from either the Building Inspector
and/or the Inspection Department’s designee or the City is required, shall make
application therefor in the form and manner required by the applicable Code
Section or Ordinance. Any such application shall also be considered an
application for a Certificate of Appropriateness and shall include such additional
information as may be required by the Commission. After receipt of any such
application, the Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee
shall be assured that the application is proper and complete. No building permit
shall be issued by the Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s
designee which affects a resource in a historic district or a landmark or landmark
site without a Certificate of Appropriateness, except when a structure has been
damaged by fire, windstorm, flood or other disaster, in which case the Building
Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee may issue a permit for
emergency repairs. Said reports shall be only those necessary to return the
structure to a safe, habitable condition. Any application for a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedure:
(a) When any such application is filed, the Building Inspector and/or
the Inspection Department’s designee shall immediately notify the
Chairman, or Vice-Chairman if the Chairman is unavailable, of the
Commission of the application having been filed.
(b) When the Chairman or Vice-Chairman determines that an
application is for action that will in no way alter the extant, exterior
appearance of the structure involved, the Chairman or Vice-
Chairman may recommend an exemption from a full review of the
application by the Commission in the following manner:
(1) The Chairman or Vice-Chairman shall notify, in writing,
the other members of the Commission that an exemption is
being recommended, said written notification to include a
description of the proposed action and an explanation of the
basis for the exemption.
(2) If any member of the Commission objects in writing within
CODE
262
five (5) days of being notified of the Chairman's intent to
recommend exemption, the proposal shall be placed before
the full Commission in the prescribed manner.
(3) If no objection is received, the Chairman shall notify the
applicant, the Building Inspector and/or the Inspection
Department’s designee and the City that the Commission is
recommending approval of the Certificate of
Appropriateness.
(c) When an application is not recommended for an exemption, the
Chairman or Vice-Chairman shall set a time and date, which shall
not be later than fifteen (15) days after the filing of the application,
for a hearing by the Commission and the Building Inspector and/or
the Inspection Department’s designee shall be so informed.
(d) The applicant shall, upon request, have the right to a preliminary
conference with a member of the Commission or of the
Commission staff for the purpose of making any changes or
adjustments to the application which might be more consistent
with the Commission's standards.
(e) Not later than eight (8) days before the date set for the said hearing,
the Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee
shall mail notice thereof to the applicant at the address in the
application and to all members of the Commission, which shall
serve as a call for a special meeting unless the hearing, is set for a
regularly scheduled meeting.
(f) Notice of the time and place of said hearing shall be given by
publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the City at
least three (3) days before such hearing and by posting such notice
on the bulletin board in the lobby of City Hall.
(g) Within not more than twenty-one (21) days after the hearing on an
application, the Commission shall act upon it, either approving,
denying or deferring action until the next meeting of the
Commission, giving consideration to the factors set forth in
Section 10.1-12 hereof. Evidence of approval of the application
shall be by Certificate of Appropriateness issued by the
Commission, and, whatever its decision, notice in writing shall be
given the applicant and the Building Inspector and/or the
CODE
263
Inspection Department’s designee. The Commission shall keep a
record of its actions under this Chapter.
(h) The Commission shall have the right to make such
recommendations for changes and modifications as it may deem
necessary in order to enable the applicant to meet the requirements
of the Commission.
(i) After the hearing, the Commission shall submit to the City the
Minutes of the meeting, which shall contain the Commission's
recommendation on the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the
recommendation is for approval of the Certificate of
Appropriateness, the Mayor or the President of the City Council
shall be authorized to immediately act upon the City's behalf and
issue said Certificate of Appropriateness.
(j) If the applicant objects to the Commission's decision and desires a
hearing before the City, the applicant shall file a written request
with the City Clerk not more than ten (10) days after the
Commission decides upon its recommendation. No action by the
City shall be taken on the matter within the said ten (10) day
period.
(k) If a request for a hearing before the City is timely filed, the City
Clerk shall, not later than the day after such request is filed, mail a
notice to the applicant of a hearing date, time and place, which
shall be the first meeting of the City to be held more than eight (8)
days after the filing of the request for hearing by the applicant.
However, the applicant may request, in writing, that he be heard at
the next meeting of the City and may therein waive the above
notice.
(l) An applicant, at his own expense, may have prepared a verbatim
record of the hearing before the Commission. If a verbatim record
is made of the hearing before the Commission and no request for a
hearing is filed, the City shall make its decision from such record
and the Minutes of the Commission.
(m) Upon approval thereof by the City and receipt of a Certificate of
Appropriateness signed by the Chairman or Vice-Chairman of the
Commission and by the Mayor or President of the Council, the
Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee
CODE
264
may issue a Building Permit. The issuance of a Certificate of
Appropriateness shall not relieve an applicant for a Building
Permit, Special Use Permit, variance or other authorization for
compliance with any other requirement or provision of the laws of
the City concerning zoning, construction, repair or demolition
unless such is in conflict with this Section or action taken
hereunder. If so, this Section or action taken hereunder shall
control.
(n) If no permit, variance or other authorization from either the
Building Inspector and/or the Inspection Department’s designee of
the City is otherwise required and a Certificate of Appropriateness
is required by this article, then the applicant therefore shall file an
application with the Building Inspector and/or the Inspection
Department’s designee. Thereafter, the application shall be
processed in the manner provided above. The application shall
describe what the applicant proposes to do, how it is to be done
and any such information as the Commission or Building Inspector
and/or the Inspection Department’s designee may require.
Applications for color changes to the exterior of a building will not
be considered for residential structures in the R-1, Low Density
Residential District, or the R-2, Medium Density Residential
District, with the Commission’s emphasis being to retain the
original or early color and textures of masonry surfaces, whenever
possible, to prevent indiscriminate removal of paint from
previously painted masonry and/or concrete surfaces, and to
prevent the painting of previously unpainted masonry and/or
concrete surfaces. However, when the application is for a color
change only to the exterior of a commercial structure, applicant
must come to the Historic Commission for pre-selection and preapproval.

possessor, seller, or a person for whom there is an outstanding warrant for
a crime involving drug-related activity.

The areas described in subsection A above shall be designated by the Council as
stated herein. It shall not be necessary that the list describe or designate the areas
by either name, and they may be combined on one list.
1. Unlawful drug activity, use and trafficking areas. These areas shall be
designated by the City Council, upon recommendation either by the Chief
of Police, or his designee, or a Council member, by resolution which shall
be posted in the following three (3) public places: the bulletin board at City

safety, order that person to leave that place. Any person who shall refuse
to leave after being ordered to do so shall be guilty of a violation of this
Section.

given by the person is true and, if believed by the officer at the time, would

any police officer shall, in the exercise of reasonable judgment, observe any
actions described herein by any person in any public or private place, he
may, if he deems it necessary for the preservation of the public peace and

CHAPTER 15.2
ELIMINATING SMOKING IN PUBLIC
PLACES AND PLACES OF
EMPLOYMENT *
Section 15.2-1. Title.
This Article shall be known as the City of Laurel Smokefree Air Act of 2008.
Source: Ordinance No. 1525-2008, 11-4-08
Section 15.2-2. Findings and Intent.
The Mayor and City Council of the City of Laurel does hereby find that:
The 2006 U. S. Surgeon General’s Report, “The Health Consequences of Involuntary
Exposure to Tobacco Smoke”, has concluded that (1) secondhand smoke exposure causes
disease and premature death in children and adults who do not smoke; (2) children exposed to
secondhand smoke are at an increased risk for sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), acute
respiratory problems, ear infections, and asthma attacks, and that smoking by parents causes
respiratory symptoms and slows lung growth in their children; (3) exposure of adults to
secondhand smoke has immediate adverse effects on the cardiovascular system and caused
coronary heart disease and lung cancer; (4) there is no risk-free level of exposure to secondhand
smoke; (5) establishing smokefree workplaces is the only effective way to ensure that
secondhand smoke exposure does not occur in the workplace, because ventilation and other air
cleaning technologies cannot completely control for exposure of nonsmokers to secondhand
smoke; and (6) evidence from peer-reviewed studies shows that smokefree policies and laws do
not have an adverse economic impact on the hospitality industry. (U. S. Department of Health
and Human Services: “The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco
*Editor’s Note—Ordinance No. 1525-2008, §§ 1-20, adopted November 4, 2008, did not specify the manner of codification, but was included
herein as Ch. 15.2, §§ 1-20, at the editor’s discretion.
Smoke: A Report of the Surgeon General.” U. S. Department of Health and Human Services,
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention and
Health Promotion, Office on Smoking and Health, 2006).
“Unregulated high-tech smoking devices, commonly referred to as electronic cigarettes, or “ecigarettes,”
closely resemble and purposefully mimic the act of smoking by having users inhale
vaporized liquid nicotine created by heat through an electronic ignition system. After testing a
number of electronic cigarettes from two leading manufacturers, the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) determined that various samples tested contained not only nicotine but
also detectable levels of known carcinogens and toxic chemicals, including tobacco-specific
nitrosamines and diethyl glycol, a toxic chemical used in antifreeze. The FDA’s testing also
suggested that “quality control processes used to manufacture these products are inconsistent or
non-existent.” According to a more recent study, electronic cigarette emissions are made up of a
high concentration of ultrafine particles, and the particle concentration is higher than in
conventional tobacco cigarette smoke. Electronic cigarettes produce an aerosol or vapor of
undetermined and potentially harmful substances, which may appear similar to the smoke
emitted by traditional tobacco products. Their use in workplaces and public places where
smoking of traditional tobacco products is prohibited creates concern and confusion and leads to
difficulties in enforcing the smoking prohibitions. The World Health Organization (WHO)
recommends that electronic smoking devices not be used indoors, especially in smoke free
environments, in order to minimize the risk to bystanders of breathing in the aerosol emitted by
the devices and to avoid undermining the enforcement of smoke free laws.”
The smoking of tobacco, hookahs, or marijuana and the use of electronic cigarettes are forms of
air pollution and constitute both a danger to health and a material public nuisance.
Accordingly, the City of Laurel finds and declares that the purpose of this ordinance are (1) to
protect the public health and welfare by prohibiting smoking in public places and place of
employment; and (2) to guarantee the right of nonsmokers to breath smoke free air, and to
recognize that the need to breath smoke free air shall have priority over the desire to smoke.

Section 18-59. Testing Standards/Procedures.
1. Current employees will be notified thirty (30) days before the first testing
occurs or upon adoption of this policy. Applicants for employment will
be notified (at the time of application) in writing that they may be
required to be tested for drugs/alcohol.
2. The City shall contract with a certified laboratory to conduct initial and
confirmation drug and alcohol tests. The laboratory shall be responsible
for:
a. developing the pool of covered employees by use of a “blind”
identifying system and for generating the list of individuals to be
tested (for random testing). The laboratory shall also develop a
separate pool of transit safety sensitive personnel to be tested in
accordance with FTA testing rates.
b. providing qualified individuals to secure the sample and assure its
custody (on-site, if the test is neutral selection; at the laboratory, if
post-offer or reasonable suspicion testing).
c. releasing positive and negative results to the City’s Medical
Review Officer and/or Human Resources Manager as required
CODE
437
under applicable laws and regulations.
d. storing samples and chain of custody paperwork as prescribed by
applicable state and/or federal laws and regulations.
3. The laboratory shall report test results to the City’s Medical Review
Officer within five (5) working days of the tested specimen receipt by the
laboratory. Reports shall identify the drugs/metabolites tested for, if the
specimen tested positive or negative, and the laboratory’s specification
identification number. All specimens positive on initial testing and
negative on confirmation testing shall be reported negative. The
laboratory will, before reporting test results, certify their validity.
4. The City’s Medical Review Officer shall review the test results,
individual’s known medical history and other relevant information to
determine if there is any other reasonable explanation for the positive
drug test results before notifying the City Human Resources Manager of a
positive result. The Human Resources Manager will notify the
Department Director/Chief and Chief Administrative Officer of positive
test results.
5. The following specimens are appropriate for testing: for drugs, initial and
confirmation: urine; for alcohol test: breath.
6. Initial Test – Alcohol. An alcohol level of .02 in the breath specimen of
an individual will be cause for confirmation test. This is one
consequence for this type of alcohol concentration test result.
7. Confirmation Test – Alcohol. To be considered positive and in absolute
violation, an employee’s confirmed alcohol level must be .04 or greater.
Results between .02 and .04 are not absolute violations, but require that
the employee be relieved of his/her duties until the longer of 24 hours or
the start of his/her next shift. This is one consequence for this type of
alcohol concentration test result.
8. Initial Test – Drugs. The City’s drug testing protocols shall include
marijuana, cocaine, opiates, amphetamines, and phencyclidine.
(Additional controlled substances may be included as applicable federal
and/or state laws and regulations allow.) Initial testing shall meet United
States Food and Drug Administration requirements. Cut-off levels
established by applicable federal or state laws and regulations will be
used to determine if an initial test is positive or negative.
CODE
438
9. Confirmation Test – Drugs. Positive initial tests shall be confirmed using
gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques at
appropriate cut-off levels established by applicable Federal or State laws
and regulations for tested drugs.
10. If an employee is informed by the Medical Review Officer/Human
Resources that the result of the laboratory’s analysis of his primary
specimen is positive, the employee has 72 hours from the time he is
informed of the verified positive result to request an analysis of the split
specimen being held by the laboratory. Any request for analysis of the
split specimen made after this 72 hour period will not be honored unless
the MRO, in his discretion, determines after discussion with the employee
that there were unusual circumstances that caused an excusable delay in
requesting the test. Any test of the split specimen pursuant to an
employee’s request will be at the expense of the employee.
11. Any employee to be tested, under whatever circumstances (post
accident/incident, reasonable suspicion, or neutral selection) will be
provided transportation to the collection site and, as appropriate, to the
workplace or to his/her residence or another desired location that is
within a reasonable distance of the work site.
12. Prior to testing, an individual shall be allowed to list on the laboratory’s
Chain of Custody and Control Form any prescription or non-prescription
medication currently being taken. That information will accompany the
specimen through to final testing and storage.
13. Individuals to be tested will, prior to testing, be informed at what levels
the test will be considered positive. The information will indicate the cutoff
levels for initial and confirmation testing.
14. Any employee who refuses to submit to a drug/alcohol test will be
considered insubordinate and subject to immediate termination.
15. An employee who tests positive shall be terminated. In all situations, the
employee will be apprised of his/her rights to grievance and appeal.
16. Employees required to submit to testing will be “observed” by the
certified technician to ensure the integrity of the test.
17. If a sample submitted is determined to be “diluted” by the MRO,
upon notification the employee must immediately submit another
CODE
439
sample. Failure to do so will be considered insubordinate and the
employee will be subject to immediate termination. If the second
sample is still considered “diluted” by the MRO, the test will be
considered posited and the employee will be subject to immediate
termination.
18. A submitted sample which is confirmed by the MRO to have been
altered or tampered will be considered the same as a “positive” test
result and the employee will be subject to immediate termination.

Section 18-60. Reporting Criminal Convictions.
(a) An employee must notify the governing authority of any criminal
drug conviction, including misdemeanor convictions, and/or
conviction of driving under the influence of alcohol not later than five
(5) days after the conviction becomes final.
(b) A covered employee who is convicted of a violation of a criminal

(2) To accomplish the requirements of Section 20-10(3) in setting the Rate Schedule
in Section 20-11(1) above, the following formula is to be used and calculations submitted to the
governing authority for approval.
Minimum - As directed by the governing authority.
For all usage above the volume covered by the minimum charge, use charges based an the
number of gallons of water used per month shall be separately established for two (2) categories,
capital and debt, and operating and maintenance, using the following formula. To assure adequate
recovery of cost any user charge may be adjusted upward by not more than $0.05.
CAPITAL AND DEBT
User charge = (B+C-F-M) divided by (V-Vm)
Where:
User charge = Rate per 1,000 gallons above minimum
B = Annual bond and other debt (SRF) repayments divided by 12
C = Capital requirements in current year divided by 12
F = Other funds available for current year divided by 12
M = Annual minimum collected for sewer use divided by 12
V = Monthly sewage volume for entire system in 1,000 gallons
Vm = Monthly sewage volume covered by minimum
Recovery of this portion of the User Charge is adjusted for the following increments:
First Increment - First 100,000 gals. less minimum
Rate = (1 + [V2s divided by (V2s + V4s)] x user charge
Second Increment - Next 400,000 gals.
Rate = 1 x user charge
Third Increment -
Rate = [V4s divided by (V2s + V4s)] x user charge
Where:
V2s = Monthly volume used by this group less minimum
V4s = Monthly volume used by this group less minimum
OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE
User Charge = O divided by (V - Vm)
Where:
User Charge = Rate per 1,000 gals. Above minimum
O = Operating, maintenance and normal replacement cost divided by
12
This charge is to be paid equally by all users for all use above the minimum.

published by the American Public Health Association, Methods for Chemical
Analysis of Water and Wastes published by EPA, and 40 CFR 136 and shall be
determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at
said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole has been required, the
control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the
public sewer to the point at which the building sewer, is connected. Sampling
shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of
constituents upon the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to
life, limb and property. (The particular analyses involved will determine whether
a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab
sample or samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and
suspended solids analyses are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls
whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples).
(12) No statement contained in this Section shall be construed as preventing any
special agreement or arrangement between the City and industrial concern
whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL
Sections 23-1. Policy on Gated or Guarded Public Residential Streets.
The City Council will not indiscriminately allow public streets to be
closed after business hours or otherwise. It will consider closings in
circumstances where the residential street pattern design and/or conditions are
conducive to providing increased security for neighborhood residents without
unduly burdening the general public or restricting the provision of public services
necessary for the protection of public health, safety and welfare. The City Council
will, on a case-by-case basis, review requests from citizens to close certain
residential streets on a limited basis or consider accepting the dedication of certain
private residential streets which will allow them to be closed on a limited basis.
Before allowing any closures, the Council shall find that such limited closings
will protect and assist the area either by improving security, by reducing crimes,
vandalism and nuisances, or by preventing injury to or destruction of or
interference with public or private property, or by preserving good order and
peace of the municipality, or by otherwise enhancing the public safety, health and
general welfare. The City Council may approve this request following a public
hearing after the Planning Commission has reviewed it and made a
recommendation, and there is a finding that such closing is in the public interest.

have a significant adverse effect on travel by the general public or
impede ingress or egress to the neighborhood by emergency vehicles,

general welfare and the protection of public health and safety. Said
Commission shall also make the findings that his request will further

B. Water Bill Collections
In order to avoid interruption of service, accounts must be kept current. All
accounts which have not been paid within ten days of due date will be charged a
late fee of three percent (3%) of balance.
(1) Should a bill reflect a previous balance, payment of the past due balance is
due immediately upon receipt of the monthly bill. Failure to pay the past
due balance may result in interruption of service. Failure to receive a bill
does not release customer from obligation to pay. NO SEPARATE
NOTICE OF IMPENDING DISCONNECTION WILL BE SENT to the
customer prior to interruption of service. If payment of account scheduled
for cut-off is not paid by 4:00pm on the day prior to cut-off, a service fee
of thirty-two dollars ($32.00) will be added to the balance.
(2) Customers with previous balances may be given special consideration for
extension of payment in only two ways:
a. Special arrangements may be made under conditions and terms
enumerated in Sub-Section C. Water Collection Supervisor and
Administration Duties and Roles of Article IV. Rates and Charges,
Section 25-52, Policy, of this Chapter.
b. Customers on a low fixed income consisting of one check per month
may be granted a grace period consisting of the number of days
between receipt of water bill and date on which said check is received
each month. In order to qualify for this exception, the customer must
verify that he/she receives only one check per month, must disclose the
amount of the check, and document the date upon which the check is
received each month.

c Customers that receive a large bill due to a leak on his/her water line
can request an adjustment in the charges. Only one (1) leak
adjustment will be allowed per customer in any twelve (12) month
period. To receive an adjustment in charges the customer shall
provide proof that his /her leak was repaired. Proof would include
a copy of bill from a licensed plumber along with proof of payment.
If the repair was made by the customer, a written statement along
with copies of receipts for any material used in the repair will be
considered proof. If the customer provides the required proof of
repairs, the billing department is authorized to adjust his/her account
to the average of the last three (3) months after the leak is fixed
(the account will be monitored for three (3) months to insure the
leak was fixed before the adjustment will be made). However,
the monthly bill cannot be adjusted below the minimum water usage
set forth by the City Ordinance of three thousand (3000) gallons.
The adjustment also can be retroactive for more than two (2) months.

2015, 2-5-2015; Ordinance 1629-2015, 11-03-2015.
.
(3) Water may be reinstated after receipt of the delinquent amount plus a
reinstatement fee and/or damage fees. No service disconnected for nonpayment
will be restored after 5:00 P.M. unless the arrears and late
payment fee are paid before 4:00 P.M.

2008, Art. IV, § 25-52, 11-26-08
(4) If the check for the payment of water, sewer and garbage is not honored
upon the first presentation to the bank, a Non-Sufficient Fund (NSF) fee in
the amount of $40.00 will be charged to the customer. If a second
presentation is made and the check is not honored, the customer’s water
service will be disconnected and a second NSF Fee in the amount of
$50.00 will be charged. The City may require cash or money order
payment only from any customer with a history of NSF. All reinstatements
will require the payment of the current balance including any
fees charged. No partial payments will be accepted once the water has
been turned off.

2008; Art. IV, §25-53, 11-26-08, Ordinance No. 1613-2014, 6-18-2014.
C. Water Collection Supervisor and Administration Duties and Roles:
(1) The Chief Administrator and Customer Service Manager are authorized to
work with any customer and make any agreement necessary to bring the
account up to date with the objective of maintaining the highest possible
collection percentage. Any adjustment to a customer’s account exceeding
One Hundred Dollars ($100.00) (this does not include billing corrections due
to a billing error which are the responsibility of the Billing Department) will
require two (2) of the above-mentioned signatures. No adjustments exceeding
Three Hundred Dollars ($300.00) per year per customer will be allowed. The
Chief Administrator or Customer Service Manager is authorized to deviate
from this policy where it has been determined and demonstrated that an error
has been made or that extraordinary circumstances and sound judgment
dictate that an adjustment is needed. Adjustments cannot be made purely for
political reasons or because an elected official has requested an adjustment to
a particular customer’s account. All adjustments will be documented and such
documentation will be open for inspection. The term “adjustments,” as used
herein, shall not constitute a forgiveness of monies due to the City.
(2) The Mayor or the Chief Administrator is authorized to allow a customer to
enter into a binding contract to collect arrears. The criteria for this contract is
as follows:
a. Customer must pay the current amount in full each month. Failure to
keep all current charges paid negates the contract and the City will
demand all charges paid to continue water service.
b. A MINIMUM of ten percent (10%) of arrears must be paid before the
contract is agreed to.
c. The arrears balance must be paid within six (6) months for all balances
less than One Thousand Dollars ($1000.00). Only the Mayor or City
Administrator can extend this payment for more than six (6) months.
Any balance greater than One Thousand Dollars ($1,000.00) must be
paid within twelve (12) months. Only the City Administrator or
Mayor can extend this payment for more than twelve (12) months.

d. Accounts over 120 days past due will be identified in a report to the
Mayor and City Administrator. At that time these amounts will be
removed from the Billing Department as bad debt and no longer be
reflected in the Billing Department Aging Reports.

2008; Art. IV, §25-53, 11-26-08, Ordinance No. 1613-2014, 6-18-2014.
D. City Council Responsibility:
The Council members may report discrepancies, problems, and
citizen complaints and make recommendations for relief. But, they
have no authority, individually, to direct an adjustment to accounts.
They can, as a whole, elect to deviate from this policy as an
official Council action only.
E. Violations:
Water will also be disconnected and customers will be assessed additional charges
under the following conditions.
(1) If a water meter is intentionally defaced, destroyed, or in any manner
altered or tampered with, the customer will be charged a minimum of One
Hundred Dollars ($100.00) for unreported water consumption plus the cost
of repairs, including labor and materials. Materials include the cost of the
meter and any devices attached to aid in the reading of the meter.
(2) Water service will be disconnected immediately if meter reader staff find
“jumpers” installed to either connect to the City water system or to bypass
the water meter. (“Jumpers” are defined as any method of pipes,
tubes, device or devices used to connect to the City’s water system or to
by-pass a meter.) The customer’s deposit will be taken for unrecorded
consumption. Reinstatement will require a new deposit of One Hundred
Dollars ($100.00) and reinstatement fee and full payment of account. If
no deposit has been made, proof of length of residence is required. (Any
employee or employees found making, providing or installing “jumpers”
will be terminated immediately and will be subject to prosecution. *See
Civil Service Rule 15(c) and Rules and regulations (2)(f).) This will also
apply to Contract employees.
(3) Fees will be assessed against residential or business customers who
illegally tap fire hydrants. For the first offense, the responsible person or
customer will be charged a fee of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00). For
the second and subsequent offenses, the fee will be One Thousand Dollars
($1,000.00) for each occurrence.
(4) Water service may be disconnected if the meter reader or service
personnel identify a major leak, technical or mechanical problem that
requires immediate attention. Water will be reinstated as soon as the
problem has been corrected.
(5) Special cases: fire, acts of God and other unpredictable situations, will be
reviewed on a case-by-case basis.
(6) Tampering with water meters or locks, use of jumpers or any unauthorized
use of City water without proper authorization is a misdemeanor
punishable by a maximum fine of Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00) or
thirty (30) days in jail or both.
F. Miscellaneous Policy Procedures:
(1) Sewer fees cannot be adjusted:
a. Solely because water is consumed for product or cleanup process.
b. Where water is used and cannot be returned to sewer system, i.e.,
watering lawns, unless a second meter is installed exclusively for
irrigation only. Installation of a second meter will require a second tap
fee, cost of the meter, cost of the riser, cost of the meter box, and Curb
Stops and couplings.
c. Construction: Meters requested for construction will be issued after
a deposit is collected. This deposit will be the cost of the meter plus
10%. Upon return of the meter all water use will be deducted from
the deposit and the balance will be refunded.
(2). Consumption used for filling swimming pools will NOT be charged sewer
fees.
(3). Taxation:
Sales of potable water will be taxed to all commercial and industrial
accounts serviced by the City of Laurel, Mississippi. Sales to all
apartments and trailer parks with one meter shall be charged and taxed as
a commercial account.
Residential, noncommercial or non-agricultural use and “service related
thereto” are exempt from this taxation.

(1) Potable Water. Water that is fit for human consumption.
(2) Non-Potable Water. Water not fit for human consumption or of
questionable quality.
(3) Cross Connection. Any arrangement of piping where a potable
water line is connected to non-potable water; it may be a pipe-topipe
connection where potable and non-potable water lines are
directly connected, or a pipe-to-water connection where the potable
water outlet is submerged in non-potable water. If the potable and
non-potable source are separated by gate valves, check valves or
devices other than the appropriate backflow preventer as outlined
by this Ordinance, a cross connection exists. By-pass
arrangements, jumper connections, swivel or change over
assemblies, or other temporary or permanent assemblies through
which, or because of which, backflow may occur are considered to
be cross connections.
(4) Backflow. The reversal of normal flow direction where water
flows from the intended point of delivery towards the supply.
(5) Backflow Preventer. A mechanical assembly that prevents
backflow. The assembly includes the shut-off valves, test cocks
and backflow device.
(6) Back Pressure Backflow. Backflow caused by a lower pressure in
the potable supply than at the point of delivery.
(7) Back Siphonage Backflow. Backflow caused by a negative

recommendations of the Mississippi Department of Health in
defining a high hazard connection or a low hazard connection. Of
the low hazard connections, those posing a very low risk shall be
exempt from the requirements to have a backflow prevention
device.
(A) For the purpose of this section, the following cross
connections shall be considered low hazard cross
connections posing a very low risk and therefore shall not
be required to have a backflow prevention device:
(1) Any lawn sprinkler or lawn irrigation system that is
connected to a public water system was
professionally installed, regardless of whether the
system is underground or above ground or whether
the system has pop-up sprinkler heads;
(2) Any swimming pool that is connected a public
water system and was professionally installed, or
any swimming pool that is connected to a public

water system and has a fill line with an anti-siphon
air gap;
(3) Any water fountain or cooler that provides drinking
water for human consumption, that is connected to a
public water system and was professionally
installed;
(4) Any fire sprinkler system that contains only water or
a dry pipe and no chemicals, that is connected to a
public water system and was professionally
installed; and
(5) Any commercial establishment that is connected to
a public water system, that contains no cross
connections directly with a dangerous or hazardous
substance or material.
(B) For the purposes of this section, any lawn sprinkler system
or lawn irrigation system that is connected to a public water
system and either injects or stores lawn chemicals or is
connected to a wastewater supply shall be considered as
high hazard cross connections and not exempt from the
requirements of this section; however, the local public
water system shall not be required to conduct an on-site
inspection to identify any such system under this paragraph.
(C) Additional backflow preventer devices shall not be required
for carbonated beverage dispensers if (i) the water supply
connection to the carbonated beverage dispenser is
protected against backflow by a backflow preventer device
conforming to ASSE 1022 or by an air gap, (ii) the
backflow preventer device and the piping downstream from
the device are not affected by carbon dioxide gas.

to cause a substantial depreciation of such property values.
503.05.09 All setbacks, parking areas and accessory structures shall be
so landscaped, located and constructed so as not to interfere
with the use of the surrounding property.
503.05.10 Buffer Zones - Whenever the proposed development is to
be on land zoned for commercial or industrial use and is
adjacent to any property zoned residential or when the
proposed development is on land zoned R-3 or R-4 and is
adjacent to property zoned R-1 or R-2, unless the
development is single-family residential (other than a
mobile home park or subdivision), a buffer between the
properties shall be provided as follows:
(1) Landscape. Plans shall be submitted to show how a
buffer strip averaging twenty (20) feet in width will
CODE
629
be landscaped and maintained. This area shall have
as a minimum grass or ground cover. A greater
density of landscaping may be required to reduce
site, noise, and pedestrian intrusion into residential
areas. Earthen berms landscaped with shrubs may
be permitted to achieve this requirement.
(2) Wall or fence. A six (6) foot masonry wall or a
fence of approved wood of natural decay resistance
may be built in place of ten (10) feet of the twenty
(20) foot buffer strip as outlined in subparagraph
10(a) above.
(3) Landscaping and wall or fence. The Site Plan
Review Committee and the Inspection Department
may require a masonry wall or fence and the twenty
(20) foot buffer strip (as outlined in paragraph (1)
above) if, in their opinion, it is necessary to protect
the residential zone due to an intense use of the
property by commercial or industrial occupancies or
by the very nature of the proposed development.
(4) When a development is so small in scope that the
buffer would present a hardship, the Site Plan
Review Committee and the Inspection Department
may require only a wall or fence as described in (2)
above without any additional buffer, or may waive
the buffer requirement.

second (1 second) with duration of each display
being no less than eight seconds (8 seconds).
Digital signs shall contain a default design that
will freeze the display in one static position if a
malfunction occurs. The owner of every
permitted digital sign will provide the City of
Laurel and/or MDOT (where applicable) with an
on-call contact person and phone number in
regard to each permitted digital sign. The
contact person must have the authority and
ability to make immediate modifications to the
displays and lighting levels when the need
arises.
2. Displays shall not create excessive brightness or
glare. Such displays shall contain static
messages only. Movement is not allowed.
Movement in this context is defined as the
appearance or illusion of movement, either text
or images, on any part of the sign including but
not limited to the structure, design, or pictorial
segment of the sign. This includes movement of
any illumination or the flashing, scintillating, or
varying of light intensity.
3. The digital sign must have capability to adjust
its intensity in response to ambient lighting
conditions. Signs shall not be erected or
maintained unless effectively shielded so as to
CODE
685
prevent beams or rays of direct or reflected light
from being directed at any portion of the street
or roadway. They shall not have such intensity
or brilliance as to cause glare or to impair the
vision of the driver of any motor vehicle.
Should the governing authority and/or MDOT
(where applicable) determine that the sign or
any display or effect of the sign causes glare or
in any way impairs the vision of the driver of
any motor vehicle or that the display otherwise
interferes with the operation of a motor vehicle,
then upon request the owner of the sign shall
immediately reduce lighting intensity of the sign
to an acceptable level. “Immediately” in this
context shall mean that the owner shall promptly
and diligently begin and complete modifications
as soon as he/she is advised of the problem.
Should the malfunction pose a hazard to the
safety of the traveling public, the sign shall be
turned off upon arrival by the owner or its
maintenance personnel until such repairs can be
made. Failure to reduce lighting intensity on
request shall be cause for revocation of the
permit.
4. The maximum brightness for digital signs shall
not exceed an illumination of 5,000 NITS
(candelas [the basic unit of luminous intensity]
per square meter) during the daylight hours nor
1,000 NITS (candelas per square meter) during
the period from sunset to sunrise, as measured
From a sign face at maximum brightness. Each
digital sign shall have an automatic dimmer
control to produce a distinct illumination change
from a higher illumination level to a lower one
for the period of time from sunset to sunrise.
Each sign must appropriately, automatically, and
individually adjust display brightness to
conform with applicable brightness
specifications as ambient light levels change at
each such sign location due to sunrise, sunset,
prevailing weather conditions, or otherwise.

to a digital unless the site is located in a C-2,
C-3, I-1, I-2, or I-3 site which has been
approved by the City for digital sign placement.
Nonconforming, grand-fathered, or illegal sign
structures may not be retro-fitted with a digital
sign.
6. Conversion to a digital sign will require
approval and issuance of a permit. No retrofitted
digital signs may be placed on permitted,
conforming structures without first being
approved in advance by the City of Laurel and
MDOT (where applicable).

public against any adverse impact upon the City’s aesthetic resources, avoid
potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through structural
standards and setback requirements, maximize the use of existing and approved
towers and buildings through co-location, and protect the public health, safety,
and welfare.

603.05.02 Tower and Antenna Design Requirements:
CODE
709
(A) Towers and antennas shall be designed to blend into
the surrounding environment, to the extent possible,
unless the FAA or other federal or state authorities
require otherwise or that the goal of the co-location
would be better served by an alternate design. The
use of color and camouflaging architectural
treatment is encouraged and may be required in
some area abutting residential areas or other areas of
the city. The Inspection Department may, on a
case-by-case basis, require specific colors or other
kind of camouflage, such as landscaping, to insure
that the aesthetic results compliment the
surrounding area. The use of guyed wires is
prohibited.
(B) Towers shall be of a monopole design unless the
zoning authority determines that an alternative
design would better blend in to the surrounding
environment.
603.05.03 Tower Lighting:
(A) Towers shall not be illuminated through the use of
artificial lights such as strobe lights or other lighting
devices unless specifically required by the FAA or
other state and federal government agencies. Light
fixtures may be attached if it is pat of the design
incorporated into the tower structure to be used for
the illumination of athletic fields, parking lots,
streets or other similar areas. Lighting of the
accessory buildings for basic security purposes is
permissible but may not result in unnecessary glare
on adjacent properties in residentially zoned areas.
(B) Should lighting be required by state or federal law
the lighting they shall be placed on the tower and
designed in such a way as to minimize the glare on
adjacent residential properties. White strobe lights
may not be used unless required.
603.05.04 Signs and Advertising: Towers shall not display signs or
CODE
710
advertisements for commercial or non-commercial
purposes, unless such signs are for the purpose of providing
warning or specific equipment information.
603.05.05 Accessory Utility Buildings and Screening: All utility
buildings and structures accessory to a tower shall be
architecturally designed to blend in with the surrounding
environment and shall meet the minimum setback
requirements of the underlying zoning districts. Ground
mounted equipment shall be screened from view by suitable
vegetation, except where a design of non-vegetative
screening better reflects and compliments the architectural
character of the surrounding neighborhood. The Inspection
Department may require additional screening or otherwise
require design modifications to insure that the
attractiveness and the aesthetic quality of the area is not
adversely impacted.
603.05.06 Abandoned or Unused Towers: All abandoned, unused or
obsolete towers and accompanying accessory facilities shall
be removed by the property owner within twelve (12)
months of cessation of use. In the event that a tower and its
associated facilities are not removed within twelve (12)
months of cessation of operations at a site, the tower and
associated facilities may be removed by the City and the
costs of removal assessed against the property.
603.05.07 Proof of Non-Interference: Each application for
construction of a wireless telecommunication facility shall
include either a preliminary or a certified statement that the
construction tower, including reception and transmission
functions, will not interfere with the radio, television and
public safety communications devices or other services
enjoyed by adjacent residential and nonresidential
properties. In the event only a preliminary statement is
submitted with the application a final certified statement of
non-interference will be provided and approved prior to
issuance of a building permit. The certificate shall be
certified by a licensed engineer.
603.05.08 Radio Frequency Emissions: Each application must show
that any antenna placed on the tower meets state and federal
CODE
711
regulations pertaining to non-ionizing radiation and other
health hazards related to such facilities. If new or more
restrictive standards are adopted then the antenna shall be
made to comply or continued operation may be restricted.

ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS.
605.01.Purposes and Intent.
CODE
716
It is the purpose of this Ordinance to regulate sexually oriented
businesses and related activities to promote the health, safety, morals, and general
welfare of the citizens of the City of Laurel, and to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to prevent the deleterious location and concentration of
sexually oriented businesses within the City. The provisions of this Ordinance
have neither the purpose nor the effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on
the content of any communicative material, including sexually oriented materials.
Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to restrict or deny access
by adults to sexually oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to
deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of sexually oriented entertainment
to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Ordinance to
condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene materials.
The Mayor and Council find that such regulation would protect the health,
safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Laurel, Mississippi.

SECTION 606. LANDSCAPING REGULATIONS
606.01. General Description.
The purpose and intent of the City of Laurel Landscaping Regulations is to
recapture and maintain many of the environmental features and amenities of the
City for present and future generations. Adherence to these regulations will
improve the appearance of off-street vehicular use areas and other development
parcels within the City through the installation and maintenance of landscaping
for screening and aesthetic effects, thereby serving to protect and preserve the
appearance, character, value and safety of the total urban area and nearby
properties. It is intended that these provisions shall constitute minimum
requirements. Creative designs are encouraged, and may be augmented from timeto-
time by ordinances adopted by the City Council.
606.02. Applicable Areas.
606.02.01 All developments, including parking lots, other than R-1--
Low Density and R-2 -- Medium Density Residential, shall
maintain a landscaped strip over that area being thirty (30)
percent of the lineal frontage along one street of the subject
parcel and being equal in depth to 50% of the required front
yard for the subject zoning district. This required landscape
area shall be maintained with grass or other landscape
CODE

ARTICLE VII. NON-CONFORMING USES
SECTION 701. NON-CONFORMING USES.
701.01 The lawful use of a "building" existing at the time of the
passage of this Ordinance may be continued, although such
use does not conform with the provisions hereof, and such
use may be extended throughout the building provided no
structural alterations, except those required by law or
CODE
751
Ordinance, are made therein. If no structural alterations are
made, a non-conforming use of a building may be changed
to another non-conforming use of the same or more
restricted classification. If such non-conforming building is
removed, every future use of such premises shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance.
701.02 Repairs and alterations may be made to a legal nonconforming
building, provided that no structural alterations
shall be made except those required by law or Ordinance,
unless the building is changed to a conforming use; and
provided that no additional dwelling units shall be added
where the non-conforming use results from there being
more dwelling units on the lot than is permissible in the
district in which the building is located. The Zoning Board
shall have the authority after hearing to grant extension to
non-conforming buildings not to exceed twenty-five
percent (25%) of the ground area of the same in case of
evident hardship, subject to the yard restrictions herein
provided.

of this Ordinance, although such does not conform to the
provisions hereof, may be continued, but if such nonconforming
use is discontinued, any future use of said
premises shall be in conformity with the provisions of this
Ordinance. Provided, however, that where "land" is
situated in any district other than a Heavy Industrial
District, which is now used for a use permitted only in a
Heavy Industrial District, and is not an accessory to the use
of the main building located on the same lot or grounds,
such non-conforming use of "land" shall be discontinued
and all material completely removed by its owner not later
than three (3) years from the date of the passage of the
Ordinance.
701.04 A legal non-conforming use if changed to conforming use
may not thereafter be changed back to a non-conforming
use. A legal non-conforming use if changed to a more
restricted non-conforming use may not thereafter be

conforming use shall cease to be used in a bonafide
manner as a legal non-conforming use for a period
of six (6) consecutive calendar months. Upon
evidence of hardship, the Zoning Board shall have
the power to extend the above time limits not to
exceed six (6) months. A Certificate of Occupancy
shall be issued for all legal non-conforming uses.

803.07. Conditional Uses-System, Purposes, Findings, and Applications
The Commission is empowered to hear and decide whether or not
proposed Conditional Uses authorized under this Ordinance should be granted
after receiving recommendations from the Superintendent of Inspection, based on
his review of each Conditional Use application. All Conditional Uses specified in
this Ordinance as now existing or as may be hereafter added, shall be subject to
the Commission’s review, findings and recommendations as outlined in this
Ordinance.
Source: Ordinance No. 1591-2012, 8-9-2012
803.07.01 System to Exam Conditional Use Applications.
A. In addition to zoning procedures and requirements relating
generally to issuance of building permits and certificates of
occupancy/zoning compliance, a Conditional Use system is hereby
established. It is intended that this system shall assure special
examination, review, and findings by the Commission and
appropriate agents, agencies, or bodies in connection with
proposed actions particularly specified in this Ordinance.
B. Conditional Use procedures and standards as set forth herein are
Intended to apply in relation to use, occupancy, location,
construction, design, character, scale, manner of operation, or
necessity for making complex or unusual determinations, and to
assure consideration of the particular circumstances of each case
and the establishment of such conditions and safeguards as are
reasonably necessary for protection of the public interest generally,
of adjacent properties, of the neighborhood, and of the jurisdiction
as a whole.
C. For the purposes of this Ordinance, the term “requirements” refers
To the restrictions which apply to all uses in a district, whether
CODE
763
permitted as of right or only through a Conditional Use. They
apply automatically to all uses in a zone. “Standards” are the
guidelines for use by administrators in making decisions such as
for rezoning or variances. They involve the application of stated
criteria to given situations. “Conditions” are additional restrictions
beyond the stated standards, applied to a particular use, which
might govern, for example, hours of operation or the location of
exits and entrances or the type of screening. A violation of the
conditions is a violation of the Ordinance. The above distinctions
help to define the way discretion is to be exercised in making the
provisions of the Ordinance flexible to meet the needs of different
situations in particular locations.
D. The Commission will consider the specific recommendations of
Superintendent of Inspection conditions for said Conditional Use.
E. A public hearing (after required notice under this Ordinance) shall
be held. At said hearing, any party may appear in person or by
agent or attorney. The Commission must make their decision
within a reasonable time thereafter, not to exceed 30 days.
F. After receiving recommendations from the Superintendent of
Inspection and before granting any special permit, the Commission
must make written findings that it is empowered under specified
sections of this Ordinance to grant the Conditional Use and that the
granting of the Conditional Use will not adversely affect the public
interest.
G. That in the event that opposing interests cannot be resolved, the
Commission shall find that balancing the interest of the City in
preserving the Comprehensive Plan or the interest of nearby
properties against the interest of the petitioner in using his property
as proposed to be used, the granting of the Conditional Use Permit
is required by considerations of justice and equity.
H. After completing their reviews, the Commission will forward the
application and their recommendations to the City Council.
I. If the Conditional Use application is denied, the applicant shall
receive written notice of the specific grounds for the denial.

803.07.02 Purposes of Conditional Uses
A. The development and implementation of this Zoning Ordinance is based
upon the division of the community into districts, within which the use of
land and buildings, and the bulk and location and structures in relation to
the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized, however, that there
are certain uses which, because of their unique characteristics or nature,
require special and intensive review to determine whether they should be
permitted in a specific location/district.
B. These Conditional Uses also require review based upon standards and the
Application of special conditions and safeguards if permission is granted
in such locations. Conditional Use procedures and standards as provided
herein are intended to assure that such review is made and that appropriate
conditions and safeguards are attached. Conditional Use procedures and
standards shall be applied. Conditional Uses may be granted only in cases
specified in this Ordinance.
C. Conditions maybe required for specified uses which must satisfy standards
in addition to those generally applicable in a zoning district to eliminate or
minimize the potentially harmful characteristics or impact of such
Conditional Uses on the character of the zoning district in which they will
be located.
D. No conditions shall be imposed on the Conditional Use that will result in
these standards making it unreasonably difficult to develop said
Conditional Use.
Source: Ordinance 1591-2012, 8-9-2012
803.07.02 Findings Required
The Commission shall make all of the following findings before
recommending that a Conditional Use be allowed.

E. The establishment and maintenance of the
Conditional Use is not detrimental to the public
Health, safety, or general welfare and that the
Conditional Use with specific limitations and design
features as may have been required will further the
Aims of the Comprehensive Plan and will not be
Unduly detrimental to nearby properties.
F. The Conditional Use as located, designed, maintained,
and operated will be compatible with the
existing or intended character of that zoning district.
G. The Conditional Use does not depreciate property
Values.
H. The Conditional Use is not hazardous, detrimental,
or disturbing to present surrounding land uses due
to noise, glare, smoke, dust, odor, fumes, water
pollution, erosion, vibration, general unsightliness,
electrical interference, or other nuisance.
I. The Conditional Use generates only minimal additional
vehicular traffic on local streets and does not
create traffic congestions, unsafe access, or parking
needs that will cause inconvenience to the adjoining
properties.
J. The Conditional Use is served adequately by
by essential public services such as streets, police,
fire protection, utilities, schools and parks.
K. The Conditional Use does not create excessive
additional requirements at public cost for public
facilities and services and shall not be detrimental
CODE
766
to the economic welfare of the City.

the site’s important natural and scenic features into the
development design.
M. The Conditional Use shall cause no adverse environmental
effects or only minimal adverse effects.
N. That the required notice has been given.
O. That all specific conditions of this Ordinance relative to the
Conditional Use have been met.
P. That the appellant has made a binding agreement for any
specific limitations or conditions necessary to protect the
public interest and assure the continued beneficial use and
enjoyment of nearby properties or that no special limitations
are necessary to protect the public.
803.07.04 Applications
Applications for Conditional Use may be accompanied by applications
for rezonings and/or variances from the Zoning Ordinance or other
City Ordinances. When this happens, the Superintendent of Inspection
will
Schedule a simultaneous hearing between the bodies/agencies involved to
Hear and decide the applications with the Conditional Use. The following
Individual procedures must be followed.
A. All applications for Conditional Uses must first be
submitted
To the Superintendent of Inspection, who reviews them in

the cost of improvements which primarily benefit the whole community be borne
by the whole community.
(d) Reconcile any difference of interest.
(e) Establish adequate and accurate records of land subdivision.
Section 104. Jurisdiction.
104.1. These regulations and development standards shall apply to the following

intended for commercial or industrial use.

(d) The dedication or vacation of any street, alley or easement through any
tract of land regardless of the area involved.
Section 105. Administration.

The City Council shall have the power and authority to provide for and pay to any member of the police
department or fire department of such municipality additional compensation for services and duties performed

ordinarily worked by such member. Nothing herein contained shall be construed to relieve any such member of
the police department or fire department from being subject to call for duty on a twenty-four-hour basis whether
or not additional compensation is paid. Provided, however, that no policeman or fireman shall perform any
duties or other work during regular working hours for any person or association, group or drive, or during hours

CHAPTER 2
RECRUITMENT POLICY
EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY
Sec. 2-1. The City of Laurel provides equal employment opportunities to all employees and applicants for
employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, or status of Vietnam-era
or special disabled veteran in accordance with applicable federal laws. In addition, the City of Laurel complies
with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the
City has facilities. This policy applies to all terms and conditions of employment, including, but not limited to,
hiring, placement, promotion, termination, layoff, recall, transfer, leaves of absence, compensation, and
training.
The City of Laurel expressly prohibits any form of unlawful employee harassment based on race, color,
religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, status as Vietnam-era or special disabled veteran, or status in any
group protected by state or local law. Improper interference with the ability of the City's employees to perform
their expected job duties is not tolerated. With respect to sexual harassment, the City prohibits the following:
(1) Unwelcome sexual advances; requests for sexual favors; and all other verbal or physical conduct
of a sexual or otherwise offensive nature, especially where:
(a) Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of
employment.
(b) Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as the basis for decisions affecting an
individual's employment; or
(c) Such conduct has the purpose or effect of creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive
working environment.
(2) Offensive comments, jokes, innuendoes, and other sexually oriented statements.
Sec. 2-1. (l) COMPLAINT PROCEDURE
Each member of management is responsible for creating an atmosphere free of discrimination and harassment,
sexual or otherwise. Further, employees are responsible for respecting the rights of co-workers.
If you experience any job-related harassment based on your sex, race, national origin, disability, or another
factor, or believe that you have been treated in an unlawful, discriminatory manner, promptly report the incident
to your supervisor, who will investigate the matter and take appropriate action, including reporting it to the
Director of Personnel. If you believe it would be inappropriate to discuss the matter with your supervisor, you
may bypass your supervisor and report directly to the head of your department or to the Director of Personnel,
who will undertake and investigation. Your complaint will be kept confidential to the maximum extent
possible.
If the City determines that an employee is guilty of harassing another individual, appropriate disciplinary action
will be taken against the offending employee, up to and including termination of employment.
The City prohibits any form of retaliation against any employee for filing a bona fide complaint under this
policy or for assisting in a complaint investigation. However, if, after investigating any complaint of
harassment or unlawful discrimination, the City determines that the complaint is not bona fide or that an
employee has provided false information regarding the complaint, disciplinary action may be taken against the
individual who filed the complaint or who gave the false information.
Sec. 2-1. (2) MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS
As part of the City of Laurel's employment procedures, an applicant is required to undergo a post-offer, preemployment
medical examination and an alcohol and drug screening that are conducted by a physician
designated by the City. Any offer of employment that an applicant receives from the City is contingent upon,
among other things, satisfactory completion of this examination and screening and a determination by the City
and its examining physicians that the applicant is capable of performing the essential functions of the position
that has been offered, with or without a reasonable accommodation.
As a condition of continued employment, employees may also be required to undergo periodic medical
examinations, and/or alcohol and drug screenings, at times specified by the City. Further, it should be
understood that the City receives a full medical report from its examining physicians regarding the applicant's
or employee's state of health. All City required medical examinations and alcohol and drug screenings are paid
for in full by the City. If an employee resigns his employment within the first ninety (90) days without just
cause, the cost of the medical examination will be deducted from his final wages. Questions about medical
examinations or alcohol and drug screenings should be directed to your supervisor or the personnel department.
Post-offer Medical Examinations are exclusive of temporary and part-time employees.
Sec. 2-1. (3) ORIENTATION PROGRAM
During your first few days of employment, you will participate in an orientation program conducted by the
personnel department and various members of your department, including your supervisor. During this
program, you will receive important information regarding the performance requirements of your position, basic
City policies, plans, your compensation, and benefits programs, plus other information necessary to acquaint
you with your job and the City. You will also be asked to complete all necessary paperwork at this time, such
as medical benefits plan enrollment forms, beneficiary designation forms, and appropriate federal, state, and
local tax forms, At this time, you will be required to present the City with information establishing your identity
and your eligibility to work in the United States in accordance with applicable federal law. Please use this
orientation program to familiarize yourself with the City and our policies and benefits. We encourage you to
ask any questions you may have during this program so that you will understand all the guidelines that affect
and govern your employment relationship with us.
Sec. 2-1. (4) PERSONNEL FILES
The City of Laurel maintains personnel files on each employee. These files contain documentation regarding
all aspects of the employee's tenure with the City, such as performance appraisals, beneficiary designation
forms, disciplinary warning notices, and letters of commendation. You may review your personnel file on an
annual basis, or in case of a special need that is in the interest of the employee. If you are interested in
reviewing your file, contact the personnel department to schedule an appointment. To ensure that your
personnel file is up-to-date at all times, notify your supervisor or the personnel department of any changes in
your name, telephone number, home address, marital status, number of dependents, beneficiary designations,
scholastic achievements, the individuals to notify in case of an emergency, and so forth.
Sec. 2-1. (5) AIDS
The City recognizes that employees with a life-threatening illness such as AIDS may wish to continue their
employment and, in fact, that continued employment may be therapeutically important to their recovery
process. The City also recognizes that it must satisfy its legal obligation to provide a safe work environment for
all employees, customers, and other visitors to our premises. As long as employees who have AIDS are able to
maintain acceptable performance standards in accordance with established City policies and procedures, and the
weight of medical evidence continues to indicate that AIDS cannot be transmitted by casual workplace contact,
employees with AIDS will be permitted to continue to work. In determining such an employee's ability to
continue in employment, the City will consider making reasonable accommodation to the employee's condition,
consistent with applicable federal, state, and local laws.
If you have AIDS or any other life-threatening illness, please contact the personnel department. See Sec. 16-
3(F). The City will take all reasonable precautions, to the maximum extent possible, to ensure that information
about your condition remains confidential. The City's personnel department will also determine what
information should be obtained from your physician so that the City can explore the types of possible
reasonable accommodation that may be recommended for you, consistent with the business needs of your
department, established policy, and applicable federal, state, and local laws.
Sec. 2-1. (6) NONDISCRIMINATION AGAINST AND ACCOMMODATION OF INDIVIDUALS
WITH DISABILITIES
The City complies with the Americans With Disabilities Act and applicable state and local laws providing for
nondiscrimination in employment against qualified individuals with disabilities. The City also provides
reasonable accommodation for such individuals in accordance with these laws. It is the City's policy to, without
limitation:
1. Ensure that qualified individuals with disabilities are treated in a nondiscriminatory manner in
the pre-employment process and that employees with disabilities are treated in a
nondiscriminatory manner in all terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.
2. Administer medical examinations (a) to applicants only after conditional offers of employment
have been extended.
3. Keep all medical-related information confidential in accordance with the requirements of the
ADA and retain such information in separate confidential files.
4. Provide applicants and employees with disabilities with reasonable accommodation, except
where such an accommodation would create an undue hardship on the City.
5. Notify individuals with disabilities that the City provides reasonable accommodation to qualified
individuals with disabilities, by including this policy in the City's employee handbook and by
posting the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission’s poster on not discriminating against
individuals with disabilities and other protected groups conspicuously throughout the City's
facilities.
Sec. 2-1. (7) Procedure for Requesting an Accommodation
Qualified individuals with disabilities may make requests for reasonable accommodation to the City's equal
opportunity/affirmative action officer (Personnel Director). On receipt of an accommodation request, the
Personnel Director will meet with the requesting individual to discuss and identify the precise limitations
resulting from the disability and the potential accommodation that the City might make to help overcome those
limitations. The Personnel Director, in conjunction with the supervisor, and, if necessary, appropriate
management representatives identified as having a need to know, will determine the feasibility of the requested
accommodation, considering various factors, including, but not limited to, the nature and cost of the
accommodation, the availability of the City's overall financial resources and organization, and the
accommodation's impact on the operation of the City, including its impact on the ability of other employees to
perform their duties and on the City's ability to conduct business. The Personnel Director will inform the
employee of the City's decision on the accommodation request or on how to make the accommodation.
Recruitment of employees for positions in the City service shall be the responsibility of the Personnel Director.
The Personnel Director will welcome assistance from Department Directors and other employees of the City in
obtaining suitable applicants for positions with the City. All applicants, regardless of race, color, creed,
religion, sex, age, disability, national origin, veteran, or political background, shall be given equal consideration
for all positions with the City of Laurel.
No applicant shall be hired or employee transferred into a department in which any supervisor or director of that
department is related to the applicant or employee within the third degree.
Sec. 2-2. Procedure for Requesting Personnel
Department Directors shall notify the Personnel Director as far in advance as possible of any requirement for
additional or replacement personnel by submitting a request for personnel. The Personnel Director shall review
the request and, in consultation with the appropriate Department Director, consider the methods of filling the
vacancy. Vacancies within the classified service of the City will be posted on all bulletin boards in all
departments of the City as soon as practical.
Sec. 2-3. Promotions from Within the Department
The factors in determining promotions shall be efficiency of service, promise of continued development,
education and background, length of service, and/or competitive examinations. These criteria are observed so
that both employees and the public will regard the government service as a career; efficiency and ability will be
recognized; and the turnover of personnel will be minimized.
Sec. 2-4. Transfer of other Qualified City Employees
Transfers may be made between positions within the classified service. Should the new position have different
minimum qualifications, the employee seeking the transfer shall be required to prove that he possesses such
qualifications. A request for transfer must be initiated in writing by the employee so affected on forms
furnished by the City and must be approved by the Director of Personnel.
Sec. 2-5. Recruitment of New Employees
If no employees are available for promotion or transfer to the position, or if no employee available for
promotion or transfer is satisfactory, the position shall be filled by employing a person not then employed by
the City. After the candidate has been selected, the Personnel Director shall require all necessary forms be
filled out prior to the candidate's beginning work. The Personnel Department shall then maintain all necessary
records and information on each City employee.
Sec. 2-6. The Disqualification of Applicants
The Personnel Director shall reject any application which indicates that the applicant does not possess the
minimum qualification required for that particular position. Applicants shall also be rejected if the applicant:
(1) is physically unfit to perform the duties of the particular position;
(2) is addicted to drugs or intoxicants;
(3) has been convicted of a felony or has on record an excessive number of minor violations, except
in cases where the Administration finds satisfactory evidence of rehabilitation;
(4) has made false statements or committed fraud in his application;
(5) has failed to properly fill out his application blank;
(6) has been a former employee dismissed for cause, except in cases where the Administration finds
satisfactory evidence of rehabilitation; or
(7) is related within the third degree to any person who is elected or appointed within the municipal
government.
Sec. 2-7. Filing and Disposal of Applications
The Director of Personnel shall preserve for at least six months all applications of applicants who fail the
examination, who arc permanently rejected, or who fail to report to work after being appointed. The application
and other materials of all other applicants shall remain on file for a period of two years and may at the end of
this period be destroyed by the Personnel Director. Applications of those persons who arc appointed to a
position with the City shall be placed in the employee's file. The Mississippi Employment Service may provide
this service for the City.
CHAPTER 3
TYPES OF APPOINTMENTS
Sec. 3-1. Regular Full Time Appointment
An employee who has successfully completed his probation period is considered a regular full time employee.
A regular full time employee may have his job terminated or may be transferred for incompetency only by the
Mayor upon the recommendation of the Personnel Director and Department Director.
Sec. 3-2. Probationary Appointment or Temporary Appointment
An employee who has been hired as a prospective regular full time employee and who has not completed his
probationary period is a probationary employee. At the end of his third and fifth month of the probationary
period, the Department Director shall evaluate the employee's work performance to ascertain his ability to
continue working on his job. After discussion of performance with the employee by the supervisor, the
evaluation shall be given to the Personnel Director as a permanent part of the employee's record. Employment
of the probationary employee may be terminated for proper just cause at the recommendation of the Department
Director after consultation with the Personnel Director, during the probationary period.
Sec. 3-3. Part-Time Appointment
An employee who is serving in a job for which there have been established fewer than 40 scheduled working
hours per week is a part-time employee.
Sec. 3-4. Acting Appointment

Sec. 5-2. Layoff
(1) Employees are laid off either because of lack of work or funds or because of a change in

concerned of the number of jobs which shall be vacated in his department.

transferred or demoted rather than separated.

or demoted.

transferred or demoted.

the last to be transferred, demoted, or separated.

shall be the last to be transferred, demoted, or separated.
(f) Bumping will not be allowed for any reason.

the Personnel Director of the jobs which are vacated and the employees who shall be
separated, transferred, or demoted.

(1) An employee should give two weeks advance notice of resignation to his Department Director,
who shall submit notice to the Personnel Director.
(2) Unexcused failure to return to work at the time specified when a leave or vacation has been granted

notification, depending upon the circumstances, along with documentation to verify the
circumstance.
Sec. 5-4. Separation
(1) The last day that an employee actually worked shall be the separation date. The Department
Director shall notify the Personnel Department of the separation of an employee and the reason
for separation. The Personnel Department shall notify all persons who need to know the date of
separation to compute the wages and fringe benefits accruing to the employee.
Sec. 5-5. Reemployment and Service Credit of Separated Employees

job.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS
Sec. 7-1. Types of Leave Authorized
FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVES OF ABSENCE
PART A: Employees Who Qualify for a Leave Under the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993
The City will grant a leave of absence to regular full-time and regular part-time employees (who meet the
requirements described below) for the care of a child after birth or adoption or placement with the employee for
foster care, the care of a covered family member (spouse, child, or parent) with a serious health condition, or in
the event of an employee's own serious health condition. Leaves will be granted for a period of up to twelve
weeks in any twelve-month period. An employee must have completed at least one full year of service with the
City and have worked a minimum of 1,250 hours in the twelve month period receding the leave to be eligible
for such leave.
1. If the leave is planned in advance, you must provide us with at least thirty days' notice prior to
the anticipated leave date, using the City's official Leave-of-Absence Request Form.
2. If the leave is unexpected, you should notify your supervisor and the Personnel Department by
filing the Leave-of-Absence Request Form as far in advance of the anticipated leave date as is
practicable. (Normally, this should be within two business days of when you become aware of
your need for the leave.)
All City benefits that operate on an accrual basis (e.g., vacation, sick leave days) will cease to accrue during the
leave period. You will be required to use all accrued, unused vacation and sick leave days during the leave
period. Once such benefits are exhausted, the balance of the leave will be without pay. All group health
benefits will continue during the leave provided you continue regular employee contributions to these plans.
(Other benefits, such as retirement, payroll deducted additional plans, will be governed in accordance with the
terms of each benefits plan.) Employees requesting a leave to care for a covered family member with a serious
health condition may be required to provide medical certification from the family member's physician attesting
to the nature of the serious health condition, probable length of time treatment will be required, and the reasons
that the employee is required to care for this family member. Employees may also be required to provide
additional physician's statements at the City's request. Further, the family member may be required to submit to
medical examinations by physicians designated by the City at its discretion and at the City's expense.
Leave For Employee's Serious Health Condition
You will be required to use all accrued, unused sick, vacation and other accrued leave, prior to being eligible for
any of the City's benefits under salary continuation plan. Once such accrued benefits are exhausted, the balance
of your leave will be without pay.
During your leave, you may also be required to provide the City with additional physician's statements on
request from the City or the City's insurance carrier attesting to your continued disability and inability to work.
You may also be required to submit medical examinations by physicians designated by the City at its discretion
and at the City's expense, at the beginning of, during, or at the end of your leave period, and to provide the City
access to your medical records as required.
Before you will be permitted to return to work from medical leave, you will be required to present the City with
a statement from your physician indicating that you are capable of returning to work and performing the
essential functions of your position, with or without reasonable accommodation.
Leave taken to care for a child after birth, adoption, or placement in your home for foster care must be taken in
consecutive workweeks. Leave taken for the employee's or a covered family member's serious health condition
may be taken consecutively, intermittently, or on a reduced work/leave schedule based on certified medical
necessity. In such instances, the City will follow applicable federal and state laws in reviewing and approving
such leave requests.
Reinstatement Rights
Eligible employees are entitled on return from leave to be reinstated to their former position or an equivalent
position with equivalent employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. Exceptions
to this provision may apply if business circumstances have changed (e.g., if the employee's position is no longer
available due to a job elimination). Exceptions may also apply for certain highly compensated employees under
certain conditions. In addition, employees on a leave extension are not guaranteed reinstatement. These
employees will be handled in accordance with the reinstatement provisions in this policy.
Vacation Leave
(1) For the purpose of accrual the vacation year shall be January 1 through December 31. Vacation
is expressed in terms of hours. Except for those departments that normally work on holidays

vacation purposes. Employees shall earn and may take vacation based on the following schedule
of City service:
CONTINUOUS FULL-TIME PERSONNEL

leave into the next calendar year. Vacation leave carried over shall not be accumulated.
Editor’s Note: Council Order of 12-22-2015 authorized changing the maximum from 40 hours to 48.
(3) Upon completion of an employee’s first, tenth, and fifteenth year of service, the employee will
be entitled to the number of hours of vacation listed above for that calendar year..

taking vacation, except for accrued unused vacation at the time of termination or retirement (up
to 200 hours). No days can be swapped or donated to other employees..

approval. Available vacation leave may be taken anytime during the calendar year after one (1)
year of service as a full-time employee. You should submit a vacation request to your supervisor
prior to the date that you wish for your vacation leave to begin. Leave without prior approval
shall be considered leave without permission.

allowance for sick leave shall be granted in advance or in anticipation of future sick leave
credits. In such cases, payroll deduction for the time lost shall be made for the period during
which absence occurred; however, earned vacation leave may be used for this purpose if the
employee so elects in writing.
(3) In the case of extended illness where an employee has exhausted his accumulated sick leave, all
unused vacation time may be taken.

(1) week following an employee's return to work will result in the employee being
charged with leave without pay for that time.
(E) Chronic sick leave users may be required to undergo an annual physical examination, at
the City's expense, to determine if disability retirement would be beneficial. Chronic sick
leave users and sick leave abusers are defined as those individuals who:

employees working 30 or more hours per week.
Sec. 7-14. (A) Continuing or Converting Your Group Health Insurance Coverage
If you resign or are terminated from the City or if your work hours are reduced, and if this event makes you or
your dependents no longer eligible to participate in one of our group health insurance plans, you and your
eligible dependents may have the right to continue to participate for up to eighteen months at your (or your
dependents') expense. If you are determined to be disabled under the Social Security Act at the time your
termination or reduction in hours occurs, you may be entitled to continuation coverage for up to twenty-nine
months.
Your eligible dependents may also extend coverage, at their expense, for up to thirty-six months in our group
health insurance plans in the event of your death, divorce, legal separation, or enrollment for Medicare benefits,
or when a child ceases to be eligible for coverage as a dependent under the terms of the plan. The eighteenmonth
continuation coverage period provided in the event of your termination or reduction in working hours
may be extended to thirty-six months for your spouse and dependent children if, within that eighteen-month
period, you die or become divorced or legally separated, or if a child ceases to have dependent status. In
addition, if you enroll in Medicare during the eighteen-month period, your spouse and dependent children may
be entitled to extend their continuation period to thirty-six (36) months, starting on the date that you become
eligible for Medicare.
If you or your eligible dependents elect to continue as members of the city's plan, you will be charged the
applicable premium charged the City by our carriers plus an additional two percent (2%). Employees with
disabilities, however, will be charged an additional percent of the applicable premium during the nineteenth
through the twenty-nine months of continuation coverage, premium is subject to change if the rates being
charged the City increase or decrease.
Continuation coverage may end, however, if any of the following events occur: (1) failure to make timely
payments of all premiums; (2) assumption of coverage under another group health plan, which does not exclude
or limit coverage provided to you on account of a preexisting medical condition; or (3) the City's termination of
its group health plans. If you enroll for Medicare, you will no longer be eligible for continued coverage, but, as
noted earlier in this statement, your spouse and dependent children may be entitled to extend their continuation
coverage.
You will be contacted concerning these options at the time termination occurs or your work hours are reduced.
However, in the event that you become divorced or legally separated, or one of your dependents ceases to be
eligible for coverage under our group health insurance plans, you and/or your dependents are responsible for
contacting the Personnel Department and the plan administrator to discuss continuation/conversion rights. You
and your qualified beneficiaries are also responsible for notifying the Personnel Department within sixty days of
qualifying for social security disability benefits. For further details regarding continuing or converting your
group health insurance benefits, please contact the Personnel Department.

within the pay period in which the holiday occurs. The employee has the option of taking this

Sec. 8-1. Salary Administration Programs
To attract and retain above-average employees, the City endeavors to pay salaries competitive with those paid
by other municipalities. In line with this objective, each position at the City has been studied and assigned a
salary grade. Each grade has been assigned a corresponding salary range. Periodically, the City may revise its
job descriptions, evaluate individual jobs to ensure that they are rated and paid appropriately, and review job
specifications to ensure that they are directly job-related. Your total compensation at the City consists not only
of the salary you are paid but also of the various benefits you are offered, such as group health and life
insurance and your retirement plan, as described in a section of this handbook. Questions regarding our salary
administration program or your individual salary should be directed to your supervisor or the personnel
department.
Sec. 8-1. (A) Regular Pay Procedures
All salaried City employees are paid by check on a semimonthly basis, usually on the fifteenth and on the last

usually be paid on the day preceding the weekend or holiday. All required deductions, such as for federal, state
taxes, retirement, and all authorized voluntary deductions, will be withheld automatically from your paychecks.
Please review your paycheck for errors. If you find a mistake, report it to your supervisor immediately. Your

preapprove overtime worked.
(3) If any of this policy on overtime conflicts with Federal Court decisions or any Federal Labor
laws on the subject, then those instruments shall supersede these rules.
Sec. 8-1. (C) Rest and Meal breaks
While Mississippi does not require employers to give meal breaks, rest breaks or both to its employees,
the City of Laurel chooses to provide one meal break and one rest break during each consecutive four (4) hour
period of an eight (8) hour work day. Each department head has the responsibility for determining when and for
what duration meals and rest breaks may be taken, so as not to disrupt the operation of the department. Lunch
breaks should be thirty (30) minutes or sixty (60) minutes depending on the department. Rest breaks should be
no more than ten (10) minutes. Ten (10) minute rest breaks are to be taken on the premises and not off city
property, without the permission from the supervisor and cannot be added to thirty (30) minute or sixty (60)
minute lunch breaks.
CHAPTER 9
Sec. 9-1. Uniforms
The City will participate in uniform cost for all employees except administrative and clerical. Uniforms for
City employees are for the purpose of identification in the performance of their jobs. Uniforms are to be issued
as soon as possible after hire date. Full uniforms provided must be worn on the job. Uniforms must be turned in
at the time of termination to the supervisor prior to receiving final pay check, or the employee will be charged
for them.
Sec. 9-1. (A) Personal Appearance and Demeanor
Discretion in style of dress and behavior is essential to the efficient operation of the City. Employees are,
therefore, required to dress in appropriate business attire and to behave in a professional, businesslike manner.
Please use good judgment in your choice of work clothes and remember to conduct yourself at all times in a
way that best represents you and the City. Employees are also required to keep their work environment clean
and orderly. Before departing at the end of their workday, employees should lock all files and cabinets and clear
all work materials from desk, especially materials of a sensitive or confidential nature. Employees failing to
adhere to proper City standards with respect to appearance and demeanor are subject to disciplinary action.
Sec. 9-1. (B) Smoking
To maintain a safe and comfortable working environment and to ensure compliance with applicable laws,
smoking in City owned and operated offices and facilities is strictly prohibited. Employees smoking in any
nonsmoking area may be subject to disciplinary action. Please contact the Safety Officer if you have any
questions about the City's smoking policy. Complaints about violations of this policy may be filed under the
City's complaint resolution procedure, which is described elsewhere in the handbook.
Sec. 9-1. (C) Drug-free Workplace
It is the policy of the City to create a drug and alcohol-free workplace in keeping with the spirit and intent of the
Drug-and-Alcohol-Free Workplace Ordinance established by the Laurel City Council July 7, 1992. The use of
controlled substances is inconsistent with the behavior expected of employees, subjects all employees and
visitors to our facilities to unacceptable safety risks, and undermines the City's ability to operate effectively and
efficiently. In this connection, the unlawful manufacture, distribution, dispensation, possession, sale, or use of a
controlled substance in the workplace or while engaged in City business off the City's premises is strictly
prohibited. Such conduct is also prohibited during non-working time to the extent that in the opinion of the City,
it impairs an employee's ability to perform on the job or threatens the reputation or integrity of the City.
Applicants for employment must submit to an initial pre-employment drug screen. If an employee resigns his
employment within the first 90 days, without just cause, the cost of the drug screen will be deducted from his
final wages. Periodically, employees will be required to submit to random drug screens as required in the City's
established drug policy. At its discretion, reasonable suspicion tests will be required of any employee who is
suspected to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs.
CHAPTER 10
TELEPHONE USE, POSTAGE METER, FAX MACHINE
Sec. 10-1. Any change in the telephone service of the City involving additions, alterations or adjustments
must be approved by the Mayor.
(A) The Postage Meter and Fax Machine is prohibited for personal use.
(B) Telephone usage for personal calls is restricted to local calls only.
(C) When answering the telephone for the City, identify the “City of Laurel,” the “department
reached”, and state “how may I help you”. Always be courteous. If you have to place a
person on hold, ask “will you hold for just a moment please” then go back to the phone
right away. If information will have to be searched for, ask them if you can call them back
in a few minutes to keep them from holding too long.
(D) All changes or additions of telephone numbers within the City Departments must be given
to the Personnel Department to maintain an updated listing of City numbers and departments.
(E) The Safety Officer will be in charge of overseeing any changes that are made to the phone
systems. This includes installation or removal of phones or lines to the current system.
Sec. 10-2. City Vehicle Use
Listed are the employees who are allowed to drive City vehicles on a twenty-four (24) hour basis. When an
employee is called out in an emergency, he will be paid the approved mileage rate to and from his residence.
No vehicles are to be taken outside the City limits at any time, except for approved City business.
(Mayor, Chief Administrative Officer, Police Department, Fire Chief, Airport Manager) Exceptions will be
determined by the administration, with City Council ratification.
Sec. 10-3. City employees have the responsibility to use assigned City owned equipment in a safe manner.
Damage and/or loss of such equipment is not only costly to the City but may also effect the job performance
when out-of-service.
In cases where City owned equipment is lost, damaged, or destroyed as a result of willful acts or through gross
negligence, the employee shall be required to pay the cost for repair or replacement.
Such payment will be made directly to the City of Laurel through the City Clerk’s office. Financial
arrangements must be made by employee.
Non-payment in a timely manner will be cause for dismissal. Should a person terminate City employment prior
to completing the incurred obligation, further legal actions may be taken by the City.
Payment of debt does not release an employee of other penalties as defined in the Personnel Rules and
Regulations.
CHAPTER 11
CIVIL SERVICE
Sec. 11-1. (1) The Civil Service Commission is established and functions in accordance with the
laws of the State of Mississippi and Personnel Rules and Regulations. It is composed
of seven (7) qualified citizens of the City who are appointed by the Mayor and
confirmed by the City Council and serve six (6) year terms.
(2) All employees covered by the Civil Service Rules will be required to obey those rules
as well. Civil Service Rules will have priority over Personnel Rules and Regulations
where there is a conflict. Federal and State Laws will have priority over Civil Service
Rules where there is a conflict.
(3) The Commission serves to provide a functional, orderly and uniform system for the
administration of a City Civil Service system on the basis of merit, efficiency, fitness,
and equality of opportunity for positions in the public service which will attract and retain
individuals of character and ability; and to increase efficiency of City government
operations by improvement in the methods of Personnel Administration and
Management.
(4) The Commission meets monthly and holds special meetings as needed.
CHAPTER 12
GIFTS
Sec. 12-1. Any public employee who receives any gifts from a private citizen or business firm is subject to
criticism. This is particularly true if the citizen or business firm is one with which the employee must deal in
his official capacity. In order to eliminate criticism and misunderstanding, the following rules shall constitute
the official policy of the City with regard to the acceptance of gifts by City employees:
(1) No gifts shall be received if a favor or consideration is either expressed or implied by the giver.
(2) No money shall be accepted under any circumstances.
(3) City employees may accept, on rare occasions, any gift which they could consume (eat or drink) in
one day, or which has a retail value of ten dollars or less.
(4) City employees may accept any inexpensive item which is mass produced and would normally be given
to the general public, such as imprinted pencils, pens, calendars, or other novelty items.
Sec. 12-2. Failure to comply with this policy shall constitute a major violation of the rules, and those found
guilty shall be punished accordingly.
Sec. 12-3. Any vendor of the City determined by the Mayor of giving employees gifts or special
considerations in the attempt to win preferential treatment in the awarding of city contracts and business shall
be barred from doing business with the City of Laurel for a period of not less than one year or more than five
years.
CHAPTER 13
SAFETY
Sec. 13-1. The Administration is concerned for the safety and well-being of all employees. Accidents are
costly in terms of human pain and suffering. They also cost in terms of time lost by the injured employee, the
cost of repairing or replacing damaged equipment, the cost of medical treatment, and the cost of paying
personnel who must investigate accidents and keep records.
Sec. 13-2. The individual employee should be concerned for his own safety, and for that of fellow
employees and the public. No one can take care of you if you will not take care of yourself.
Sec. 13-3. Employees must report unnecessarily hazardous conditions in the work place to their supervisor.
Supervisors must take steps to correct safety problems and submit a written report outlining the steps taken to
correct the problem to their Department Director and a copy must be forwarded to the Safety Officer.
Sec. 13-3. (1) All employees will be required to read, comprehend and follow the guidelines set forth in the
Injury and Illness Prevention manual.
Sec. 13-4. When engaged in hazardous work, every employee is required to follow appropriate safety
practices. Employees are required to wear whatever protective gear has been issued, even though it may
sometimes feel uncomfortable or clumsy. The foreman is required to ensure that his personnel have and use the
appropriate safety equipment.
Sec. 13-5. Safety awareness includes taking care of all tools and equipment and vehicles. Vehicle operators
must have a valid driver's license in their possession. Driver's licenses must be checked at random by the
Administration. Operators and passengers of safety belt equipped City-owned vehicles are required to use such
equipment, unless such operators or passengers belong to a class of persons exempted for medical, physical or
occupational reasons. Vehicles must be kept clean at all times. Vehicle operators, before beginning daily
duties, must check to see that the vehicle has been properly serviced and that equipment such as foot and
emergency brakes, horn, windshield wipers, lights and turn signals are operating properly.
Sec. 13-6. Employees found responsible for abuse or neglect of tools, equipment, vehicles or other type of
City property, and in violation of safety practices will be disciplined in accordance with Sec. 16-2(E)
Sec. 13-7. What to Do If You Have an Accident on the Job
(1) Report immediately to your supervisor who will see that you get first aid or other medical attention.
Any injury, no matter how small it may seem, must be reported to the supervisor immediately. The proper
injury forms must be turned in to the Safety Officer within 48 hours of the accident even if a physician was not
seen.
(2) Be sure that an Accident Report is completed and that you sign it. The Accident Report will prove that
your injury happened on the job and will be paid per policy rules and regulations. At the doctor's office or the
hospital, report the City of Laurel's Workers Compensation as the liable party for payment. Someone there will
call the Personnel Department to verify your employment.
(3) You will be referred to a City-designated physician. If you think your best interest has been prejudiced
by the findings of the City-designated physician, you have the privilege of a medical examination by a
physician of your own choosing at the expense of the City; however, notification must be given to the Safety
Officer in advance. An employee who consults a second physician without prior approval will be personally
responsible for any medical expenses thus incurred.
(4) A disabled employee is expected to return to work immediately upon obtaining a medical release.
Foremen are encouraged to find light duties for an injured employee who is able to work but is not yet
physically able to perform his normal duties.
(5) An employee who fails to return to work by the date specified on the physician's statement or who fails
to present a required doctor's certificate of continued disability, will be deemed to have voluntarily resigned
from employment with the City and the City released from any other obligation.
(6) Disability cases will be reviewed every thirty (30) days by the Safety Officer, the affected Department
Director and a designee of the Mayor.
CHAPTER 14
MUNICIPAL WORKERS’ COMPENSATION POLICY
Sec. 14-1. This policy is to cover any municipal employee who is injured while performing municipal
duties.
Sec. 14-2. General Provisions: The City will perform the guidelines set forth in the Mississippi Workers’
Compensation Law, and judicial interpretations.
Sec. 14-3 Policy regarding Drug/Alcohol Testing Related to Workman’s Compensation Claims
In the event that an employee sustains an injury at work or asserts a work-related injury, the
employer shall have the right to administer drug and alcohol testing or require that the employee
submit himself to drug and alcohol testing. If the employee has a positive test indicating the
presence, at the time of injury, of a drug illegally used or the use of a valid prescription
medication(s) taken contrary to the prescriber’s instructions and/or contrary to label warnings, or
eight one-hundredths percent (.08%) or more by weight volume of alcohol in the person’s blood,
it shall be presumed that the proximate cause of the injury was the use of a drug illegally, or the
use of a valid prescription medication(s) taken contrary to the prescriber’s instructions and/or
contrary to label warnings, or intoxication due to the use of alcohol by the employee. If the
employee refuses to submit himself to drug and alcohol testing immediately after the alleged
work related injury, then it shall be presumed that the employee was using a drug illegally, or
was using a valid prescription medication(s) contrary to label warnings, or was intoxicated due to
the use of alcohol at the time of the accident and that the proximate cause of the injury was the
use of a drug illegally, or the use of a valid prescription medication(s) taken contrary to the
prescriber’s instructions and/or contrary to label warnings, or intoxication due to the use of
alcohol by the employee. The burden of proof will be placed upon the employee to prove that
the use of drugs illegally or the use of a valid prescription medication(s) taken contrary to the
prescriber’s instructions and/or contrary to label warnings or intoxication due to the use of
alcohol was not a contributing cause of the accident in order to defeat the defense of the
employer provided under Section 71-3-7.
Based on the City’s Drug-Free Workplace policy, disciplinary action would be taken upon an
employee having a positive drug and/or alcohol test conducted pursuant to this policy and would
also include the employee’s having a positive drug and/or alcohol test conducted pursuant to this
policy and would also include consideration of the following circumstances regarding the
employee:
(1) If he/she is authorized to carry a firearm in the course and scope of his/her employment
(2) If he/she is involved in the interdiction of illegal drugs and Paraphernalia
(3) If the employee is a firefighter
(4) If the employee is covered by the DOT drug and alcohol regulations applicable to gas
and hazardous chemical pipelines
(5) If the employee is covered by the DOT drug and alcohol regulations applicable to
drivers of vehicles with gross weights of 26,001 pounds or more
(6) If there was reasonable suspicion of drug and/or alcohol
Sec. 14-4. Administration of Benefits:

claims and enforce the drug policy.

SIGN DEFINITIONS
For the purpose of this Ordinance, the following words and phrases shall
have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by Section 602, General Sign
Regulations [of Appendix I]:
CHARACTER: Any letter of the alphabet or any numeral.
EFFECTIVE AREA: for detached signs, means the area enclosed by the
minimum imaginary rectangle of vertical and horizontal lines which fully contains
all extremities of the sign, exclusive of its supports. This rectangle is to be
calculated from an orthographic projection of the sign viewed horizontally.
A viewpoint for this projection is to be taken which gives the largest
rectangle of that kind, as the viewpoint is rotated horizontally around the sign. If
elements of the sign are movable or flexible, as a flag or string of lights, the
measurement shall be taken when the elements are fully extended and parallel to
the plane of view.
EFFECTIVE AREA: for attached signs, shall mean the sum of the areas of
the minimum imaginary rectangles enclosing each word attached to any particular
facade.
CODE
806
CODE
807
A horizontal “orthographic projection” is simply a nonperspective
view of an object - a perpendicular projection seen
from the ground, like the architect’s evaluation of a building.
The “effective area” definition suggests a two-step process for
calculating sign area. First, one must choose the point of view
from which the sign looks widest. For flat signs, this
viewpoint is directly opposite the face. If the sign were a cube
in shape, this viewpoint would be opposite a corner. Now the
picture of the sign seen from this viewpoint is enclosed within
the smallest rectangle which fully contains the sign. The area
of that rectangle is the “effective area” of the sign.
FACADE: Any separate face of a building, including parapet walls and
omitted wall lines, or any part of a building which encloses or covers usable
space. Where separate faces are oriented in the same direction, or in the
directions within forty-five degrees (45?) of one another, they are to be considered
as part of a single facade.
HEIGHT: As applied to a sign, shall be measured as the vertical distance
between the highest part of the sign or its supporting structure, whichever is
higher, and a level plane going through the nearest point of the improved public
right-of-way, other than an alley.
INTERSECTION: The junctions of the center lines of any two (2) public
rights-of-way, other than alleyways.
LUMINANCE: The brightness of a sign or a portion thereof expressed in
terms of footlamberts. For the purposes of this definition, luminance shall be
determined by the use of an exposure meter calibrated to standards established by
the National Bureau of Standards and equipped with a footlambert scale.
OCCUPANCY: The purpose for which a building is used or intended to
be used. The term shall also include the building or room housing such use.
Change of occupancy is not intended to include change of tenants or proprietors.
PREMISE: Any lot or unplatted tract, or any combination of contiguous
lots or unplatted tracts held under single ownership.
SETBACK: The required distance between any point on private land and
the nearest point at the edge of the nearest public right-of-way, other than an alley.
Where a public way crosses a railroad right-of-way, the setback distance is to be
measured from the public right-of-way line extended across the railroad right-ofway.
CODE
808
SIGN: Any device, light, figure, picture, letter, word, message, symbol,
plaque, or poster visible from outside the premise on which it is located and

made of cloth or vinyl, which is suspended from a building or is suspended
between two poles. Banners are not considered permanent signs and may not be
used in lieu of permanent signs. The use of banners is regulated under Section
602: General Sign Regulations, Subsection 602.01.04.
SIGN, DETACHED/GROUND MOUNTED SIGN: Any sign connected to
the ground which is not an attached sign, inclusive of signs on movable objects.
SIGN, DIRECTIONAL: A non-premise sign whose content is limited
exclusively to the identification of specific premise or occupancy located
elsewhere, and which tells the location of or route to that premise or occupancy.
SIGN, DIGITAL/LED(LIGHT EMITTING DIODE): Any sign having the
capacity to display a message on the face or facing of a sign by manipulation of
light projected onto a screen or otherwise produced within the screen. Digital
signs include those using LED Technology, Plasma Technology, or any similar
method/technology to produce the same results as LED or Plasma. Placement of
such signs is regulated under Section 602.12.12 of the Zoning Ordinance.
Source: Ordinance No. 1565-2010, Appendix B, Definitions, 7-20-2010
SIGN, ILLUMINATED: Any sign which is directly lighted by any
electrical light source, internal or external. This definition shall not include signs

transportation. This definition shall not include signs which are being transported
to a site of permanent erection.

be any of the following:
(a) Any word in any language found in any standard unabridged
dictionary or dictionary of slang.
