§ 33-17. General rules and regulations.
A. Code of Ethics.
(1) Law enforcement is an honorable calling. Service in this field
demands a professional rather than an occupational philosophy.
Personal honor, a desire for professional status, and devotion to
service above self are the motives which compel a police officer to
discharge his responsibility in full measure.
(2) A police officer's life is one of self-sacrificing service to a high ideal,
based upon his recognition of the responsibilities entrusted to him/
her and the belief that law enforcement is an honorable vocation.
He/she fully accepts his/her responsibilities to defend the right, to
protect the weak, to aid the distressed, and to uphold the law in
public and in private living. He/she accepts the obligation to report
facts truthfully and to testify without bias or display of emotion, and
to consider all information coming to his/her knowledge by virtue of
his position as a sacred trust, to be used for official purposes only.
He/she gives his/her loyal and faithful attention to the identification
and apprehension of criminals, being equally alert to protect the
innocent and prosecute the guilty. He/she performs the functions of
his/her office without fear, favor, or prejudice and does not engage
in unlawful or improper practices.
(3) He/she does not disclose to unauthorized persons any information
concerning pending matters which might be prejudicial to the
interests of the state, Township of River Vale, or the Department.
§ 33-16 RIVER VALE CODE § 33-17
29:104
(4) He/she does not seek to benefit personally by any confidential
information which has come to him/her by virtue of his/her
assignment. He/she is respectful and courteous to all citizens. He/
she is faithful and loyal to his/her organization, constantly striving
to cooperate with and to promote better relations with all regularly
constituted law enforcement agencies and their respective in
matters of mutual interest and obligation.
(5) Rigid adherence to the principles set out above is mandatory for
anyone accepting a position in the Police Department. Acceptance
of these principles should not be perfunctory; it should be weighed
carefully. Citizens are quick to criticize any misconduct of members
of the Department; the community places a trust in police officers
and expects them to so conduct themselves as to merit this trust.
Members should be proud to hold a position that demands so much.
(6) There must be a moral philosophy and strong appreciation of the
need for service in any profession. Unwavering adherence to such a
moral philosophy will earn for police officers the respect and
support of the public.

Enforcement Code of Ethics, as contained herein.

powers by any member for the purpose of violating the rights of any
person is prohibited.
(6) Conduct unbecoming a police officer (Class 2 offense).
§ 33-17 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 33-17
29:105
(a) Due to the nature of police work, the need for organizational
cohesion and cooperation, the awesome power and public trust
granted police officers, the autonomy they often work under
and the credibility needed to sustain effective law
enforcement, police officers must be held to the highest
standard in order for a Police Department to carry out its law
enforcement mission.
(b) Accordingly, police officers shall conduct themselves at all
times, both on and off duty, with high ethical standards, so as

conduct by a civilian employee that adversely affects the

Department, is conduct unbecoming an employee in the public
service and shall constitute grounds for disciplinary action.
(b) Slander, false reporting or any means of retaliation by an

always subject to duty and they shall at all times respond to the
lawful orders of superior officers and other proper authorities, as

delegation of the enforcement of certain laws and ordinances to
particular subdivisions of the Department does not relieve

prompt, effective police action within the scope of those laws and
ordinances when the occasion so requires. Members assigned to
special duties are required to take proper action outside the scope
of their specialized assignment when necessary.

or abusive language toward or about a supervisor or superior
officer.
(3) Neglect of duty (Class 2 Offense). Employees shall faithfully and
diligently carry out all of the duties and fulfill all of the obligations
of their office. Failure to take appropriate action on the occasion of
a crime, disorder, or other action or condition deserving of police
attention or any other omission by an employee which represents
an abandonment of one's duties, obligations or assignment is
neglect of duty and will subject that employee to discipline.
(4) Questions about assignment (Class 5 offense). Members and
employees in doubt as to the nature or detail of an assignment)
order shall seek such information from their supervisors by going
through the chain of command.
(5) Knowledge of laws and regulations (Class 4 offense).

working knowledge of all laws and ordinances in force in the
Township of River Vale, as well as all rules, regulations,

29:107

all employees and shall be cause for dismissal. This shall apply
regardless of the severity of the offense and reckoning period, and
regardless of whether the violations are of the same type.
(7) Relationship of penalties to offense. The information contained
herein is intended to guide the appropriate authority in

sufficient cause.
B. Disciplinary procedure.
(1) Establishing a violation. Existence of facts establishing a violation
of a law, ordinance, or rule is all that is necessary to support any
allegation of such violation as a basis for disciplinary action.
Nothing in this manual prohibits disciplining or charging
employees merely because the alleged act or omission does not
appear herein if such conduct is otherwise without lawful purpose
and violates some law, ordinance, or rule governing the officer's
conduct at the time it occurred or is otherwise such an egregious or
blatant act that would be universally recognized as misconduct.

take the following disciplinary measures:
(a) Counseling.
(b) Oral reprimand.
(c) Written reprimand (subject to the approval of the Chief of
Police).
(d) Emergency suspension until the next business day.
§ 33-18 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 33-18
29:125
(e) Written recommendations for other penalties.
(3) Emergency suspensions.
(a) Any superior officer may immediately suspend an employee
from duty if they determine one of the following exist:

health, order or effective direction of public services; or
[4] The member has been formally charged with a crime of the
first, second or third degree, or a crime of the fourth
degree on the job or directly related to the job.
(b) In accordance with N.J.S.A. 40A:14-149.1, notwithstanding any
other law to the contrary, whenever any municipal police
officer is charged under the law of this state, another state, or
the United States, with an offense, said police officer may be
suspended from performing his duties, with pay, until the case
against said officer is disposed of at trial, until the complaint is
dismissed, or until the prosecution is terminated; provided,
however, that if a grand jury returns an indictment against said
officer, or said officer is charged with an offense which is a high
misdemeanor or which involves moral turpitude or dishonesty,
said officer may be suspended from his duties, without pay,
until the case against him is disposed of at trial, until the
complaint is dismissed or until the prosecution is terminated.
The Chief of Police shall immediately submit a report
explaining such action to the Mayor.
(4) Emergency interdepartmental disciplinary action. When the
improper conduct of a member or employee of one division/bureau/
unit is of such nature that immediate or emergency disciplinary
action is required of a command or supervisory officer of another
division/bureau/unit, such action may be taken at once within the
following limitations:
(a) Oral reprimand.
(b) Emergency suspension until the next business day.
(5) Interdepartmental oral reprimand. When the commanding or
supervisory officer of one division orally reprimands a member or
employee of another division, he shall notify the supervisor of the
member or employee so disciplined as soon as possible. He shall
also submit a written report of this action and the reason therefor
to his commanding officer and also the commanding officer of the
member or employee.
§ 33-18 RIVER VALE CODE § 33-18
29:126
(6) Follow-up on emergency suspensions. A member or employee
receiving an emergency suspension shall be required to report to
the Chief of Police on the next business day at a time scheduled by
the Chief of Police. The commanding or supervisory officer
imposing or recommending the suspension shall also report to the
Chief of Police at the same time. In the absence of the Chief of
Police, it shall be the responsibility of the Acting Chief of Police.
(7) Reports of disciplinary action taken or recommended. Whenever
any disciplinary action is taken or recommended (except for oral
reprimands), a written report must be submitted immediately to
the Chief of Police containing the following information:
(a) The name, rank, badge number, and present assignment of the
person being disciplined.
(b) The date, time and location of the incident.
(c) The section number and name of the violated rule.
(d) A complete statement of the facts of the misconduct.
(e) The punishment imposed or recommended.
(f) The written signature, badge number, and rank of the
preparing officer and his position in relation to the member or
employee being disciplined.
(8) Endorsement and forwarding of disciplinary reports. Each level in
the chain of command must review, sign and forward reports
bearing on disciplinary matters. Such endorsement may be one of
approval, disapproval, or modification. No employee shall alter or
cause to be altered or withdrawn any disciplinary report.
Disciplinary reports in transit through the chain of command shall
not be delayed, but must be reviewed, endorsed, and forwarded as
soon as possible. Disciplinary reports shall be filed in accordance
with current Departmental procedures.
(9) Informing the person being disciplined. The member being
disciplined shall be so informed of the charges, in writing, as
provided by N.J.S.A. 40A:14-147 and Subsection D(1) of these rules
and regulations. The member shall be granted all procedural rights
and safeguards as provided by law.
(10) Misconduct observed by police personnel. Whenever any
commanding officer or supervisory officer observes or is informed
of the misconduct of another member or employee which indicates
the need for disciplinary action, he shall take authorized and
necessary action and render a complete written report of the
incident and his actions to his commanding officer.
(11) Investigator's authority. Investigators assigned to an investigation
are the direct representative of the Chief of Police and, as such,
§ 33-18 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 33-18
29:127
shall receive the cooperation of all employees of the Department
while conducting their investigations. The sole responsibility of the
investigator shall be the gathering of all the facts regarding the
allegations. In doing so, he must remain objective and thorough
when submitting his report. His opinions, conclusions, or
personality shall not be interjected into the case. By adhering to
the foregoing principles, the case can be concluded with optimum
fairness for all persons concerned.
C. Departmental disciplinary hearings.
(1) Charges. When an internal investigation establishes a
preponderance of evidence that a member is guilty of violating a
Department rule or regulation, penalty for which entitles the
member to a hearing as provided for in Subsection D(1), a
preliminary notice of disciplinary action shall be prepared and
personally served upon the respective member. The charges shall
contain:
(a) The name, address and title of the member against whom the
action is being instituted.
(b) The rule, regulation, law or ordinance violated, or a description
of other misconduct being charged.
(c) Specification of the alleged facts upon which the charges are
based.
(d) The time, date and place at which the hearing is scheduled to
be held.
(e) The signature of the proper authority and his official title.
(2) Hearings.
(a) The disciplinary hearing shall be scheduled during the
business day, but no sooner than 10 days and no later than 30
days after said notice is personally served upon said member,
subject of course to the granting of reasonable requests for
postponements.
(b) Where a disciplinary hearing has been postponed pending the
determination of criminal or quasi-criminal charges filed on the
basis of the same factual situation which gave rise to the
Departmental charges, said Departmental hearing must be
held within 30 days after the Department receives notice of
such disposition. The duty to advise the Department that said
judicial determination has been made is that of the respective
member.
(c) Personal service is actual service upon any employee as well as
actual service upon any member of the employee's household
over 18 years of age residing in the residence of said employee.
§ 33-18 RIVER VALE CODE § 33-18
29:128
(d) All disciplinary hearings shall be closed to the public unless the
defendant officer requests an open hearing. In such case, the
Department reserves the right to petition the hearing officer to
conduct a closed hearing if a legitimate reason exists for such
request.
(e) Every member formally charged with a violation of Department
rules and regulations shall have the opportunity to testify in his
own defense, produce relevant evidence in support of his
defense, produce competent witnesses to testify to relevant
matters in support of his defense and cross-examine any
witness who has testified against him.
(f) The Chief of Police may prosecute the complaint himself or
request the Township to appoint a qualified representative to
present the case.
(g) The Mayor shall be the hearing officer charged with the
responsibility of conducting the necessary hearings with
respect to the aforementioned charges. The Mayor may
appoint a qualified representative to serve as hearing officer to
prepare findings of fact and recommendations as to violations
and quantum and type of punishment, if any.
(h) In order that all parties may be afforded a fair and equal
opportunity to be heard and that the hearing officer may be
completely informed in the matter and enabled to render a
proper determination based on all the facts and applicable
laws and rules, all hearings shall be conducted in an informal
manner, without reference to any formal rules or procedure.
(i) The hearing officer may, at his/her discretion, clear the hearing
room of all persons, including witnesses not under examination
or testifying. When the evidence pertains to scandalous or
indecent conduct of any sort, or is such that its public
disclosure would not be in the best interest of the public and
might do irreparable harm to any person or persons not a party
to the hearing, the hearing officer may exclude all persons not
having a direct interest in the matter being heard.
(j) The hearing officer shall admit all testimony having
reasonable, probative value, but shall exclude immaterial,
irrelevant or unduly cumulative testimony.
(k) The hearing officer shall give effect to the rules of privilege as
provided by law, but no person shall be excused from testifying
or presenting evidence on the ground of possible selfincrimination
with regard to an administrative disciplinary
matter.
(l) The member is presumed innocent and the burden of proof is
upon the Department to prove the member's guilt by a
§ 33-18 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 33-18
29:129
preponderance of the credible evidence presented during said
hearing.
(m) All hearings may (in the discretion of the respective hearing
officer) be recorded by:
[1] A certified shorthand report; or
[2] Stenographers, duly sworn to make an accurate
stenographic recording of the proceeding; or
[3] Sound-recording device to be operated under the
supervision and direction of the hearing officer.
(n) After considering all the evidence in support and in defense of
the particular charge of misconduct, the respective hearing
officer shall consider same and render his verdict as soon as
practical thereafter.
(o) Although the verdict may be verbal at the time of the hearing,
the determination must be reflected upon a final notice of
disciplinary action that must be personally served upon the
respective member as soon as practical after the termination of
said disciplinary hearing.
(3) Appeals.
(a) Any member of the Department who has been tried and
convicted upon any disciplinary charge or charges may obtain
review in the Superior Court of Bergen County.
(b) Such review shall be obtained by serving a written notice of the
application therefore upon the appropriate authority within 10
days after the written notice to the member of his conviction.
The appropriate authority shall transmit to the court a copy of
the record of such conviction, and of the charge or charges for
which the member was tried.
(c) The court shall hear the case de novo on the record below and
may either affirm, reverse or modify such conviction. If the
member shall have been removed from his position, the court
may direct that he be restored to such position and all his
rights pertaining thereto, and may make such other ordered
judgment as said court shall deem proper.
(d) Either the Township or the member may supplement the
record with additional testimony subject to the rules of
evidence.
D. Members rights during Departmental investigations and disciplinary
hearings.
§ 33-18 RIVER VALE CODE § 33-18
29:130
(1) Hearing. Each member is entitled to a hearing before the
appropriate authority or his designee, for any charge that exposes
the employee to discipline as follows:
(a) Surrender of leave time.
(b) Monetary fine.
(c) Suspension with pay.
(d) Suspension without pay.
(e) Loss of promotion opportunity.
(f) Demotion.
(g) Termination.
(2) Confidentiality. Other than the official findings and attendant
penalties, every internal investigation and subsequent
Departmental hearing shall be considered privileged and
confidential information, and same shall not be made public and/or
released to any nongovernmental agency.
(3) Scope of interviews. Investigations shall be limited to matters of
legitimate concern to the Police Department. Those issues include:
(a) Violation of any federal or state statute or local ordinance.
(b) Violation of any rule, regulation, policy, procedure, written
directive or order of the Police Department.
(c) Activities, circumstances, conditions or events that:
[1] Threaten the safety of the public or the employees of the
Department;
[2] Threaten efficiency, discipline or good order of the
Department;
[3] Damage the reputation or integrity of the Police
Department;
[4] Diminish the ability of the Police Department to carry out
its public safety function.
(d) The fitness of continued employment of any employee.
(e) The performance of official duties of any employee of the Police
Department.
(f) The conduct of any employee that may form the basis for
disciplinary action.
(4) Conduct of interviews.
§ 33-18 PERSONNEL POLICIES § 33-18
29:131
(a) All employees have a duty to answer all questions truthfully
and completely.
[1] Truthfulness is the key to the proper function of any Police
Department. Officers must know that during any official
inquiry they are not at liberty to decide when they will tell
the truth. Officers must be truthful at all times. When an
officer willfully lies in an official inquiry he:
[a] Frustrates the investigative effort that he is obligated
to assist.
[b] Destroys his own credibility, which is an essential tool
for the completion of his duties.
[c] Damages the credibility of the Department and the
law enforcement community as a whole.
[d] Frustrates the law enforcement function that he is
sworn to uphold.
[2] Integrity is the most critical of all minimum requirements
to function effectively as a police officer. When it is lost,
the ability to carry out the duties of a police officer are lost
with it. For these reasons the standard penalty for lying in
any official inquiry will be termination. An officer may not
be subject to dismissal for a specific act of misconduct,
however, if he lies about it he surely will. [Employees may
not lie for any reason. "Our legal system provides methods
for challenging the government's right to ask questionslying
is not one of them," LaChance v. Erickson, United
States Supreme Court.]
(b) No questioning or investigative effort shall be initiated
arbitrarily for personal or other reasons that are unrelated to
the maintenance of Departmental efficiency or integrity.
(c) During the course of an investigation, employees have a duty to
voluntarily disclose any relevant information that may assist in
proving or disproving an allegation under investigation.
(5) Due process. Although the Department can utilize any form of
investigative procedure pursuant to an internal investigation that is
fair and reasonably calculated to achieve its objective, the nature
or utilization of same must not violate the basic concepts and
substantive due process of law.
(6) Coercion. Although cooperation of an employee is demanded under
threat of disciplinary action (including job forfeiture), said
employee shall not be questioned or subjected to investigative
efforts under circumstances that would render such statements
void as being coerced.
§ 33-18 RIVER VALE CODE § 33-18
29:132
(7) Advisement of member.
(a) Exclusive of the normal reporting duties incidental to the
performance of official duties, a member subjected to
questioning shall be advised of the following:
[1] Whether he is being questioned or required to submit to
investigative efforts as a suspect or a witness.
[2] The identity of his interrogator as well as the identity of all
persons present at the time of the interrogation.
[3] The nature of the investigation and facts sufficient to
apprise the member of the existing allegations.
(b) Nothing in this section shall prohibit any supervisory officer
from questioning an employee in an emergent situation when
such questioning appears immediately necessary to insure the
public safety or to preserve the order of the Police Department.
(c) Nothing in this or any other section shall be deemed as
justification for an employee providing false information.
(8) Time limitations. Consistent with state statute and Township Code,
a formal charge must be filed against a member within a
reasonable time after which the existence of the alleged or
suspected misconduct is made known.
(9) Representation. Employees are entitled to have a representative of
their choice in attendance during an Internal Affairs interview. The
investigator shall allow any employee a reasonable amount of time
for the desired representative to attend. The representative shall
be an observer only and may not actively participate in the
interview.
(10) Polygraph. No employee shall be ordered or asked to submit to a
polygraph (lie detector) test for any reason. Such test may be given,
however, if requested by the employee.
(11) Settlement agreement. Nothing shall prohibit a member from
directly negotiating a settlement agreement with the Chief of
Police or appropriate authority concerning the disposition of a
disciplinary matter. If a settlement is reached concerning the
disposition of a pending disciplinary matter, a stipulation and
agreement as to disciplinary action form shall be fully executed by
the effected member, Chief of Police or appropriate authority
concerning the disposition of a disciplinary matter. If a settlement
is reached concerning the disposition of a pending disciplinary
matter, a stipulation and agreement as to disciplinary action form
shall be fully executed by the effected member, Chief of Police and
appropriate authority.

$1,000,000 per occurrence. In the event said certificate of insurance is
not provided as set forth above, the request for an officer shall not be
granted.
C. Any requesting person shall be obligated to reimburse the Township of
River Vale for all reasonable attorneys' fees incurred to defend itself
against any claim, suit, demand for subrogation, or other action which
arises from the hiring of an off-duty member.
A. The company, organization or contractor that hires an off-duty member
of the Police Department shall pay a fee to the Township as follows:
(1) An officer hired for non-traffic-control or security details shall be
compensated at $60 per hour plus a 10% administrative fee

the off-duty police officers. The Township shall notify the organization
or contractor upon the expenditure of 50% of the escrow funds. At that
time, a determination shall be made as to whether or not the balance is
sufficient to pay for further services that may be required. In the event
the remaining balance is insufficient, the company, organization or
contractor shall, within 24 hours of notice of the deficiency, deposit
funds in an amount sufficient to cover the additional services. Any funds
remaining in the escrow account shall be refunded to the organization,
vendor or contractor that posted said escrow funds within 60 days of
receipt by the Township of the refund request.
E. Invoices shall be paid in full within 45 days of the date of the invoice. In
the event the invoice is not paid in full within 45 days, the organization

from the developer sufficient to make 10% of the adaptable
entrances in the development accessible:

entrance, upon the request of a person with disabilities
who is purchasing or will reside in the dwelling unit, an
accessible entrance shall be installed.
[2] To this end, the builder of restricted units shall deposit
funds within the Township of River Vale's Affordable
Housing Trust Fund sufficient to install accessible
entrances in 10% of the affordable units that have been
constructed with adaptable entrances.
[3] The funds deposited under Subsection B(2)(f)[2] above

accessible entrances.
[5] Once the Construction Official has determined that the
design plan to convert the unit entrances from adaptable
to accessible meet the requirements of the Barrier Free
Subcode, N.J.A.C. 5:23-7, and that the cost estimate of
such conversion is reasonable, payment shall be made to
the Township's Affordable Housing Trust Fund in care of
the Township Chief Financial Officer who shall ensure that
the funds are deposited into the Affordable Housing Trust
Fund and appropriately earmarked.
[6] Full compliance with the foregoing provisions shall not be

pricing restrictions for low-income units.
C. A certified household that purchases a restricted ownership unit must
occupy it as the certified household's principal residence and shall not

allowable resale price. Other items may be sold to the purchaser at a
reasonable price that has been approved by the administrative agent at
the time of the signing of the agreement to purchase. The purchase of

unit resale, provided the price, which shall be subject to ten-year,
straight-line depreciation, has been approved by the administrative
agent. Unless otherwise approved by the administrative agent, the
purchase of any property other than central air conditioning shall not

article for a period of at least 30 years, until River Vale takes action to
release the unit from such requirements. Prior to such action, a
restricted rental unit must remain subject to the requirements of

restriction. A copy of the filed document shall be provided to the
administrative agent within 30 days of the receipt of a certificate of

2A:58-11 alleging a violation or violations of the regulations
governing the affordable housing unit. If the owner, developer or

developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following
penalties, at the discretion of the court:
(a) A fine of not more than $500 per day or imprisonment for a
period not to exceed 90 days, or both, provided that each and
every day that the violation continues or exists shall be
considered a separate and specific violation of these provisions
and not a continuation of the initial offense;
(b) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment into the Township of River Vale
§ 43-19 POLICE RESERVE § 43-20
36:163
Affordable Housing Trust Fund of the gross amount of rent
illegally collected;
(c) In the case of an owner who has rented a low- or moderateincome
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units, payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable
relocation costs, as determined by the court.
(2) The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court
seeking a judgment that would result in the termination of the
owner's equity or other interest in the unit, in the nature of a
mortgage foreclosure. Any such judgment shall be enforceable as if
the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low- or moderateincome
unit.
(a) The judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the
municipality, by means of an execution sale by the Sheriff, at
which time the low- and moderate-income unit of the violating
owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less than the
amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase
money mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the
enforcement proceedings incurred by the municipality,
including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have his
right to possession terminated as well as his title conveyed
pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
(b) The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to
satisfy the first purchase money mortgage lien and any prior
liens upon the low- and moderate-income unit. The excess, if
any, shall be applied to reimburse the municipality for any and
all costs and expenses incurred in connection with either the
court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the
Sheriff's sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's
sale are insufficient to reimburse the municipality in full as
aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible
for the full extent of such deficiency, in addition to any and all
costs incurred by the municipality in connection with collecting
such deficiency. In the event that a surplus remains after
satisfying all of the above, such surplus, if any, shall be placed
in escrow by the municipality for the owner and shall be held in
such escrow for a maximum period of two years or until such
earlier time as the owner shall make a claim with the
municipality for such. Failure of the owner to claim such
balance within the two-year period shall automatically result in
a forfeiture of such balance to the municipality. Any interest
accrued or earned on such balance while being held in escrow
shall belong to and shall be paid to the municipality, whether
such balance shall be paid to the owner or forfeited to the
municipality.

§ 43-21. Appeals.
Appeals from all decisions of an administrative agent appointed pursuant to
this article shall be filed in writing with the court.
§ 43-22. Reporting and monitoring requirements.
(c) Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the
regulations governing affordable housing units shall not
extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing
affordable housing units as the same apply to the low- and
moderate-income unit. Title shall be conveyed to the purchaser
at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions
of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. The
owner determined to be in violation of the provisions of this
plan and from whom title and possession were taken by means
of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of
redemption.
(d) If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient
amounts are bid to satisfy the first purchase money mortgage
and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the
low- and moderate-income unit by satisfying the first purchase
money mortgage and any prior liens and crediting the violating
owner with an amount equal to the difference between the first
purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the
maximum resale price for which the low- and moderate-income
unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be
treated in the same manner as the excess which would have
been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
(e) Failure of the low- and moderate-income unit to be either sold
at the Sheriff's sale or acquired by the municipality shall
obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from any
qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the
municipality, with such offer to purchase being equal to the
maximum resale price of the low- and moderate-income unit as
permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing
units.
(f) The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable
for complying with the terms and restrictions of governing
affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.

Development Fees
[Adopted 12-9-2019 by Ord. No. 361-2019]
§ 43-23. Findings and purpose.
§ 43-24. When effective; approval to spend fees.
A. In Holmdel Builder's Ass'n v. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990),
the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory
development fees are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the
Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to
the Council on Affordable Housing's (COAH's) adoption of rules.
B. Pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, Section 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2) and the
Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1
through 40:55D-8.7), COAH was authorized to adopt and promulgate
regulations necessary for the establishment, implementation, review,
monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust
funds and corresponding spending plans. Municipalities that are under
the jurisdiction of the Council or a court of competent jurisdiction and
have an approved spending plan may retain fees collected from
nonresidential development.
C. In Re: Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:9723 by the New Jersey Council on
Affordable Housing, 221 N.J. 1 (2015), also known as the Mount Laurel
IV decision, the Supreme Court remanded COAH's duties to the
Superior Court. As a result, affordable housing development fee
collections and expenditures from the municipal affordable housing
trust funds to implement municipal Third Round Fair Share Plans
through July 1, 2025, are under the court's jurisdiction and are subject
to approval by the court.
D. This article establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and
expenditure of development fees pursuant to COAH's regulations and in
accordance with P.L. 2008, c. 46, Sections 8 and 32-38. Fees collected
pursuant to this article shall be used for the sole purpose of providing
low- and moderate-income housing. This article shall be interpreted
within the framework of COAH's prior round rules on development fees,
codified at N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.24 and P.L. 2008, c. 46, Section 8 (N.J.S.A.
52:27D-329.2) and the Statewide Nonresidential Development Fee Act
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 40:55D-8.7).
A. This article shall not be effective until approved by the court.
B. The Township of River Vale shall not spend development fees until the
court has approved a plan for spending such fees in conformance with
N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.1(c).25

during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance
application.
Example: If an approval allows four units to be constructed on a
site that was zoned for two units, the fees could equal 1.5% of the
equalized assessed value on the first two units; and the specified
higher percentage up to 6% of the equalized assessed value for the
two additional units, provided zoning on the site has not changed
during the two-year period preceding the filing of such a variance
application.

ordinance shall be exempt from development fees, unless the
developer seeks a substantial change in the approval. Where a site
plan approval does not apply, a zoning and/or building permit shall
be synonymous with preliminary or final site plan approval for this
purpose. The fee percentage shall be vested on the date that the
building permit is issued.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished
and replaced, unless the owner resided in the previous dwelling for
a period of one year or more prior to obtaining a demolition permit,

development fee requirement. The development fee shall be
calculated on the increase in the equalized assessed value of the

flood) shall be exempt from the payment of a development fee.
A. Imposed fees.

below, shall pay a fee equal to 2.5% of the equalized assessed value
of the land and improvements, for all new nonresidential
construction on an unimproved lot or lots.
(2) Nonresidential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted below, shall also pay a fee equal
§ 43-26 POLICE RESERVE § 43-27
36:169
§ 43-28. Collection procedures.
to 2.5% of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting from
any additions to existing structures to be used for nonresidential
purposes.
(3) Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure is demolished and replaced. The development fee of 2.5%
shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized
assessed value of the preexisting land and improvement and the
equalized assessed value of the newly improved structure, i.e.,
made an improvement, at the time final certificate of occupancy is
issued. If the calculation required under this section results in a
negative number, the nonresidential development fee shall be zero.
B. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions, and exemptions for
nonresidential development.
(1) The nonresidential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market
rate development shall be subject to the 2.5% development fee,

value resulting from alterations, change in use within the existing
footprint, reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
(3) Nonresidential developments shall be exempt from the payment of
nonresidential development fees in accordance with the
exemptions required pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, as specified in the
Form N-RDF, State of New Jersey Nonresidential Development
Certification/Exemption form. Any exemption claimed by a
developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
(4) A developer of a nonresidential development exempted from the
nonresidential development fee pursuant to P.L. 2008, c. 46, shall
be subject to it at such time the basis for the exemption no longer
applies, and shall make the payment of the nonresidential
development fee, in that event, within three years after that event
or after the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy of the
nonresidential development, whichever is later.
(5) If a property which was exempted from the collection of a
nonresidential development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt
from property taxation, the owner of the property shall remit the
fees required pursuant to this section within 45 days of the
termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid nonresidential
development fees under these circumstances may be enforceable
by the Township of River Vale as a lien against the real property of
the owner.
A. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval
for a development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its
§ 43-27 RIVER VALE CODE § 43-28
36:170
staff to notify the construction official responsible for the issuance of a
building permit.
B. For nonresidential developments only, the developer shall also be
provided with a copy of Form N-RDF, State of New Jersey
Nonresidential Development Certification/Exemption, to be completed

development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the instructions

assessed value of the development.

certificate of occupancy notifies the local assessor of any and all
requests for the scheduling of a final inspection on property which is
subject to a development fee.
F. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final
inspection, the municipal assessor shall confirm or modify the
previously estimated equalized assessed value of the improvements of
the development; calculate the development fee; and thereafter notify
the developer of the amount of the fee.
G. Should the Township of River Vale fail to determine or notify the
developer of the amount of the development fee within 10 business days
of the request for final inspection, the developer may estimate the
amount due and pay that estimated amount consistent with the dispute
process set forth in Subsection b of Section 37 of P.L. 2008, c. 46
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.6).

B. Prior to granting subdivision, site plan or conditional use approval

C. At the time above set forth, the Joint Planning Board shall require the
posting of a performance guaranty, as approved by the Board Attorney,
in an amount up to 120% of the estimated cost of the public
improvements and work as required by the Joint Planning Board. The
estimated cost for this purpose shall be determined by the Board upon
the written recommendation of the Township Engineer. The Board shall
require that a sum not in excess of 10% of such estimated cost shall be
posted with the Township as a cash performance bond. The Board shall
require that a sum equal to 7% of such estimated cost or $1,250,

commencement of operations to cover the expenses incurred and to be
incurred by the Township for engineering services and legal expenses
in connection with the subdivision and application and in connection
with the inspection and certification of improvements within the
development. The builder's agreement shall provide that if the
Township's approved expenses for such purposes shall exceed the
amount deposited, the subdivider or developer shall pay such excess
amount to the Township and shall further provide that any portion of
the deposit for costs not required to be expended for such purposes
shall be refunded to the subdivider or developer, as the case may be. No
such deposit shall be charged with an amount unless the same shall
represent a reimbursement to the Township for payments by it for
services rendered, upon proper vouchers, duly sworn to, as provided by
law. In every case, any charge to the deposit provided for herein shall
be reviewed and approved by the municipality as to the necessity for
the performance of the service and the reasonableness of the amount
charged therefor, to the same extent as if there were no provision for
reimbursement to the Township. The Township Engineer shall perform
the following inspections in connection with the certifications of
improvements within the development:
(1) Prior to the start of any excavation work, the developer shall notify
the Township Engineer. At that time the Township Engineer shall
inspect the construction location and grade stakes, original ground
conditions and weather conditions and shall decide whether work
is to proceed or be delayed.
(2) During rough grade work, the Township Engineer shall conduct
periodic inspections of work progress and investigate any
subsurface conditions that are encountered. If, during the course of
construction, unforeseen conditions, such as springs, aquifer
layers, high groundwater tables and miscellaneous unknowns are
encountered, it shall be determined by the Township Engineer
§ 142-36 JUNKYARDS § 142-36
138:365
whether or not the developer shall install additional catch basins,
storm drains, french drains or any other drainage appurtenances.
(3) The Township Engineer shall inspect all drainage trenches and
storm drain pipes prior to any backfilling of the trenches. The storm
drain pipes, pipe joints and pipe bedding shall be inspected by the
Engineer before the trenches can be backfilled. All trenches shall
be backfilled and tamped in accordance with standard
specifications approved by the Township Engineer.
(4) The Township Engineer shall inspect the excavation, subbase and
pouring of curbs and sidewalks. Said construction shall conform to
plans and specifications, the approved maps and Township
specifications and regulations.
(5) The tickets for delivery of materials or supplies on the site may be
inspected to determine the quantities used.
(6) The Township Engineer shall inspect and check the materials and
amount of said materials used for the subbase material. Said
materials shall conform to the requirements as set forth on the
plans and specifications and to Township specifications and
requirements. When approval is given by the Township Engineer,
the work may proceed.
(7) The Township Engineer shall inspect final pavement construction
work during the course of said construction. The pavement shall be
constructed in accordance with the requirements as set forth on
the plans and specifications, the approved maps and Township
specifications and regulations.
(8) The Township Engineer shall inspect the site of grading of
individual lots so as to avoid dangerous conditions or the creation
of low spots on lawns, driveways and other areas.

Township Engineer.
(10) Utilities shall be inspected by the Township Engineer in
conjunction with the various utility companies concerned.

in conjunction with a member of the Shade Tree Committee.
D. Any and all moneys posted by the developer or subdivider as a deposit
for costs of the Township's professional engineering and legal expenses
shall be deemed a credit to reduce by such amount the required posting
of 7% of the cost of construction of subdivision improvements. The
balance of any remaining moneys on deposit with the Township of River
Vale shall be refunded to the applying parties at any time following
expiration of 60 days from the receipt by the Township Clerk of the
certification of the Board Secretary that all costs and expenses of the

professional consultants, to be sufficient to defray the Township's
reasonable and necessary costs for professional and administrative services
in reviewing the application. The amount of such escrow shall be
determined within 30 days after the submission of an otherwise complete
application, or an application shall not be declared complete until such
escrow fund has been deposited. The escrow fund shall be in cash unless
the amount thereof is greater then $10,000 in which event it may be by
letter of credit in a form satisfactory to the Board Attorney. The escrow
fund shall be deposited into a separate trust account by the Township
and, if the amount thereof is greater than $5,000, it shall be deposited
in an interest-bearing account with interest accruing for the benefit of
the applicant. Disbursements may be made from the escrow fund only
after approval by the Township Council of duly submitted vouchers for

place and circumstances of such filing, the status of such other
application, reference or filing, the parties, attorneys or other
persons prosecuting the same and the anticipated date of
preliminary and final action thereon.
(6) The written consents of all owners of the property have been filed
with the proper administrative officer.

138:368
forth herein, the Board may charge the applicant an amount equal to
the fee(s) which the Board pays to a professional engineer, planner or
attorney to review the development application. If the Board determines
that it is necessary to retain the services of a professional engineer, planner
or attorney to review the development application, the applicant shall be
required to pay the initial deposit and such other additional deposits as
may be required to offset these special review costs incurred by the Board.
The applicant shall be responsible for the pro rata share of costs and fees
for the reporting and transcription of any meeting wherein the application
is discussed, reported, considered or a hearing or decision is rendered. In
the event any development application requires a special meeting date, the
Board shall charge the applicant a special meeting fee of $1,000, plus an
amount equal to the fee(s) which the Board pays to its engineer, planner,
attorney, secretary and other professional advisors who attend the special
meeting. The cost of these services shall be charged against the initial
deposit and such other additional deposits posted by the applicant. The
term "professional personnel" shall be defined to include the Township
Attorney. The intent of this section is to require that an applicant reimburse
the Township for the cost the Township incurs in the Township Attorney
reviewing documents submitted by the applicant, including, but not limited
to, developer's agreements, deeds and/or easements.
§ 142-37.2. Developer's agreements. [Added 6-27-2005 by Ord. No.
118-2005]
The Township may require upon approval of a development that the
applicant enter into a developer's agreement with the Township to ensure
that the project is completed in accordance with the resolution of approval
adopted by the Board. The form of developer's agreement, as well as any
deeds or easements to be conveyed to the Township, shall be in a form
acceptable to the Board and Township Attorney. Prior to these documents
being prepared, the person responsible for preparing the documents for
the applicant must contact the Board and Township Attorney's office in
order to make sure that the approved form of developer's agreement,
deed or easement is used. Furthermore, simultaneously with the Board and
Township Attorney reviewing the deeds or easements, the applicant must,
at a minimum, provide a title report providing clear title to the Township,
or an updated search, or an opinion letter from the applicant's attorney that
there are no liens and that the deed or easement conveys clear title.

(1) By the Township as a general improvement or as a local
improvement, or as a combination thereof; or
(2) By the subdivider or site plan applicant with a formula specified by
the Township Council providing for partial reimbursement if the
improvement specially benefits property other than that within the
subdivision or site plan.
C. The Joint Planning Board shall require, as a condition for approval of
the final plat or site plan, that:
(1) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Township as a
general improvement, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall
deposit with the Township Administrator an amount equal to the
difference, if any, between the estimated cost of the improvement
and the estimated total amount by which all properties, including
the subdivision or site plan to be serviced by the improvement, will
be specially benefited by the improvement.
(2) If the improvement is to be constructed by the Township as a local
improvement, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall deposit
with the Township Administrator, in addition to the amount
specified in Subsection C(1), the estimated amount by which the
subdivision or site plan will be specially benefited by the
improvement.
(3) If the improvement is to be constructed by the subdivider or site
plan applicant, the subdivider or site plan applicant shall file with
the Township Administrator a performance guaranty for 120% of
the full estimated cost of the improvement.
§ 142-54 JUNKYARDS § 142-55
138:381
§ 142-55. Standards for allocating costs.
A. In determining the allocation of costs for off-tract improvements among
the subdivider or site plan applicant, other property owners and the
Township, the Joint Planning Board shall be guided by the following

(6) The condition and period of usefulness of the improvements which
may be based upon the criteria of N.J.S.A. 40A:2-22.
B. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Joint Planning
Board may take into account the following specific factors:
(1) With respect to street, curb, gutter, sidewalk, shade tree,
streetlight, street sign and traffic light improvements, the Board
may consider:
(a) Traffic counts.
(b) Existing and projected traffic patterns.
(c) Quality of roads and sidewalks in the area.
(d) Such other factors as it may deem relevant to the needs
created by the subdivision or site plan.
(2) With respect to drainage facilities, the Board may consider:
(a) The relationship between the area of the subdivision or site
plan and the area of the total drainage basin of which the
subdivision or site plan is a part.
(b) The proposed use of land within the subdivision or site plan
and the amount of land area to be covered by impervious
surfaces on the land within the subdivision or site plan.
(c) The use, condition or status of the remaining land area in the
drainage basin.
(3) With respect to water, gas and electric supply and distribution
facilities, the Board may consider the use requirements of the use

improvements to be constructed or installed by the Township pursuant to
the provisions of this article shall be deposited in a suitable depository
therefor and shall be used only for the improvements for which they are
deposited or improvements satisfying the same purpose. If construction of
improvements for which the Township is responsible has not commenced
within five years from the date of deposit, the amount deposited, together
with any income thereon, shall be returned to the subdivider or site plan
applicant or his successor in interest.
§ 142-57. Actual costs to determine refund or additional charge.
Upon completion of any improvement constructed by the municipality as
a general or local improvement, the total cost of such improvement shall
be determined by the Township Administrator. The difference between the
actual cost as so determined and the estimated cost shall be computed.
The subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in interest shall make
remittance to the Township if the actual cost exceeds the estimated cost
or shall receive a refund from the funds deposited with the Township if
the estimated cost exceeds the actual cost, in an amount which bears the
same relationship to the differences between the actual and estimated costs
as the amount deposited by the subdivider or site plans applicant for his
proportionate share of the estimated cost bears to the total estimated cost.
Any sum payable by the subdivider or site plan applicant or his successor in
interest may be levied and collected by the Township in the same manner as
is provided by law for the levy and collection of real estate taxes.
§ 142-58. Successors in interest.
In the absence of an express provision in a deed or deeds of conveyance,
it shall be presumed that the fee owners of all lots in the subdivision or
site plan at the date any deposit or portion thereof is returned or additional
charge is made are the lawful successors in interest to the subdivider or
site plan applicant and that each such fee owner shall be charged with
or entitled to receive a pro rata share, based on lot area, of any funds
to be returned or additional charge to be made pursuant to this Article.

General Provisions
§ 142-65. Title.
This Part 2 shall be known as the "River Vale Flood Hazard Area Regulation
Ordinance."
§ 142-66. Statutory authorization.
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has, in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1 et
seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, the Township Council of the Township of River
Vale of Bergen County, New Jersey, does ordain as follows.
§ 142-67. Findings of fact.
§ 142-68. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this Part 2 to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. The flood hazard areas of the Township of River Vale are subject to
periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities
and, when inadequately anchored, cause damage in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected
from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.
A. Protect human life and health;
B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
47.This Ordinance Also Superseded Former Part 2, Flood Hazard Areas, Adopted 10-15-1981
By Ord. No. 0-17-81 (Ch. 34A Of 1967 Code), As Amended.

E. Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas
mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located
in areas of special flood hazard;
F. Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.
A. Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
floodwaters;
D. Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
E. Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will
unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
A. Word usage. For the purpose of this Part 2, unless the context clearly
indicates a different meaning, the term "shall" indicates a mandatory
requirement and the term "may" indicates a permissive action. Words
used in the present tense include the future tense, singular usage
includes the plural usage, and the plural usage includes the singular
usage.

C. Definitions. As used in this Part 2, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
AH ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Base flood elevations (BFEs) derived from
detailed hydraulic analyses are shown in this zone.
AO ZONE  Areas subject to inundation by one-percent-annual-chance
shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average
depths are between one and three feet.
APPEAL  A request for a review of the Construction Official's
interpretation of any provision of this Part 2 or a request for a variance.
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING  A designated AO or AH zone on
a community's Digital Flood Insurance Rate Map (DFIRM) with a onepercent-
annual or greater chance of flooding to an average depth of
one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where
the path of flooding is unpredictable and where velocity flow may be
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD  Land in the floodplain within
a community subject to a one-percent or greater chance of flooding in
any given year. It is shown on the FIRM as Zone V, VE, V1-30, A, AO,
A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH.
BASE FLOOD  A flood having a one-percent chance of being equaled
or exceeded in any given year.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE)  The flood elevation shown on a
published Flood Insurance Study (FIS) including the Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM). For zones AE, AH, AO, and A1-30, the elevation
represents the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has
a one-percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year.
BASEMENT  Any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below
ground level) on all sides.
BREAKAWAY WALL  A wall that is not part of the structural support
of the building and is intended through its design and construction to

rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure that equals
or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure at the time of the
improvement or repair when counted cumulatively for 10 years.
DEVELOPMENT  Any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures,
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations, or storage of equipment or materials located within the

138:389
ELEVATED BUILDING  A non-basement building built, in the case of
a building in an area of special flood hazard, to have the top of the
elevated floor elevated above the base flood elevation plus freeboard
by means of piling, columns (posts and piers), or shear walls parallel to
the flow of the water; and adequately anchored so as not to impair the
structural integrity of the building during a flood up to the magnitude
of the base flood. In an area of special flood hazard, "elevated building"
also includes a building elevated by means of fill or solid foundation
perimeter walls with openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movement of floodwaters.

concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain
management regulations adopted by a community.
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM)  The official map on which
the Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas
of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the
community.

the Flood Insurance Rate Map(s) and the water surface elevation of the
base flood.
FLOOD or FLOODING  A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS  Zoning ordinances,
subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special
purpose ordinances (such as a floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance
and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power.
The term describes such state or local regulations, in any combination
thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage
prevention and reduction.
FLOODPROOFING  Any combination of structural and nonstructural
additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or
eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water
and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.
FLOODWAY  The channel of a river or other watercourse and the
adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the
(1) The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.

138:390
base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation
more than 0.2 foot.
FREEBOARD  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends
to compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to

violation of other applicable nonelevation design requirements of 44
CFR 60.3.
MANUFACTURED HOME  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use
with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required
utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a recreational
vehicle.

a gas or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE  Damage of any origin sustained by a
structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its beforedamaged
condition would equal or exceed 50% of the market value
of the structure before the damage occurred. "Substantial damage"
also means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two or
more separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of
repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equals or
exceeds 25% of the market value of the structure before the damages
occurred.
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure during a ten-year period,
the cost of which equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the
structure before the start of construction of the improvement.

in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
in Subsection A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the
lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure.
(3) Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in Subsection A(4),
or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.
§ 142-80 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-80
138:400
§ 142-81. Provisions for flood hazard reduction.
In all areas of special flood hazard, compliance with the applicable
requirements of the Uniform Construction Code (N.J.A.C. 5:23) and the
following standards, whichever is more restrictive, is required:
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction and substantial improvements shall be
anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the
structure.
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved
shall be anchored to resist flotation, collapse or lateral movement.
Methods of anchoring may include, but are not to be limited to, use

§ 142-81.1. Severability.
If any section, subsection, paragraph, sentence, clause, or phrase of this
Part 2 shall be declared invalid for any reason whatsoever, such a decision
shall not affect the remaining portions of the Ordinance, which shall remain
in full force and effect, and for this purpose the provisions of this Part 2 are
hereby declared to be severable.
§ 142-81.2. Enactment.

Table 2-1.
(e) Have the manufactured home chassis supported by reinforced
piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent
strength that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade
and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation
system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.
J. Floodways. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in
§ 142-72 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an
extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry
debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following
provisions apply:
(1) Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction,
substantial improvements, and other development unless a
technical evaluation demonstrates that encroachment shall not
result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the
base flood discharge.
(2) If Subsection J(1) is satisfied, all new construction and substantial
improvements must comply with § 142-81.
(3) In all areas of special flood hazard in which base flood elevation
data has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
accumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined
with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than
0.2 of a foot at any point.

Development Standards
§ 142-91. General requirements.
§ 142-92. Minimum size.
No site shall be considered as a planned residential development for
townhouse, senior citizen or multifamily development unless it shall contain
five or more acres of adjoining and contiguous land and shall contain
sufficient access to an approved and improved public street, certified to
be suitable or approved by the Joint Planning Board, unless such site
qualifies as a planned residential development under the definition provided
in § 142-87 of this Part 4. For the purpose of this Part 4, internal streets,
roads to be dedicated and rights-of-way shall not be deemed to divide
acreage of a planned development and shall be considered as part of
the gross site area. Subdivision into lots or separate ownership of less
than five acres, however, shall not be deemed prohibited provided that
the planned residential development otherwise meets the criteria of this
section. Subdivision and separate ownership of single-family detached
dwellings on lot that comply with the lot width, lot size and road frontage
requirements applicable in A Residence Districts shall also not be deemed
A. Plot and lot sizes and dimensions, structural heights and locations may
be freely disposed and arranged in conformity with the overall density
and other standards herein provided and with the conditions of
comprehensive plans therefor, the general features and design of which
shall be approved by the Joint Planning Board.
B. The Joint Planning Board, in its findings, shall be guided by the
standards set forth herein as well as those provided in Part 8
(Subdivision of Land) and Part 9 (Zoning) of this chapter and by written
reports by the Township Engineer and Township planning consultants.
In addition, the Joint Planning Board, in its findings, shall have the right
to require modifications in the plans as submitted to the extent
provided by law and defined herein.
C. The Joint Planning Board shall also be guided by the recommendations
of the Fire Prevention Bureau, Police Department, County Planning
Board, the River Vale Board of Health and the Township Shade Tree
Commission, as well as other appropriate municipal, county and state
agencies having an interest in said development, including the
Construction Official of the Township of River Vale.
D. In connection with this Part 4, the Joint Planning Board may promulgate
rules and regulations to supplement the standards and conditions set
forth in this Part 4 not inconsistent with this Part 4 or applicable law.
E. The minimum development standards of a planned residential
development shall be in accordance with the following requirements.
§ 142-91 JUNKYARDS § 142-92
138:413
prohibited, although less than five acres in size, provided that the criteria
of this section are otherwise complied with.
§ 142-93. Aggregate areas of less than five acres.
All tracts, parcels or lots within a Planned Residential Development Zone
which do not qualify as a planned residential development, and until
preliminary site plan approval as a planned residential development, shall
be governed by the rules and regulations of the applicable zoning in effect
without reference to this Part 4.
§ 142-94. Minimum setbacks from boundary lines.
A. No building within a planned residential development that is designed
or used for other than one-family residential use or a permitted
accessory building to a one-family-building residential use shall be
located less than 50 feet from any boundary line of the Planned
Residential Development Zone District, provided that the Joint Planning
Board, on site plan review, is empowered to determine that a lesser
setback is adequate by reason of special circumstances affecting the
visual impact and the use made or to be made on adjoining premises
and in cases where the result of the proposed setback is consistent with
the overall character of the planned development, but no provision
hereof shall be deemed to empower the Joint Planning Board to approve
a minimum setback less than 40 feet from any boundary line.
B. A minimum setback requirement of not less than 50 feet from all
external lot lines and from all external streets and thoroughfares shall
be provided for all parking lots, parking areas and off-street parking
spaces; except, however, that the Joint Planning Board may permit, on
site plan review, accessory off-street parking for a planned residential
development with a distance of not less than 25 feet from external lot
lines and external streets for not more than 8% of the required offstreet
parking for the planning unit development and for not more than
22 cars, whichever is lesser, provided that the Joint Planning Board
deems the planted buffer area separating such off-street area or areas
adequate to screen such areas from the external lot line. Parking spaces
and drives for one-family residential lots, however, shall be required to
comply with the A Residence District zone requirements.
C. For purposes of Subsection A, the term "external lot lines" shall be
deemed to mean the external lot lines of the entire planned residential
development proposed to be constructed on such lot or lots, including
any road areas that are within the planned residential development,
whether such proposed road areas are to be dedicated or not. For
purposes of Subsection A, the term "external lot lines" shall not be
deemed to mean the external lot lines of any separate lot created within
the planned residential development by virtue of the site plan or
subdivision approval of the Joint Planning Board.

138:414
§ 142-95. Internal setback requirements.
§ 142-96. Residential densities and distribution of dwelling types.
A. Any proposed building or structure within the confines of a planned
residential development shall have a minimum setback requirement of
30 feet from any public or private street, road or thoroughfare right-ofway
line or a distance equal to the height of any building or structure
from said right-of-way line, whichever is greater.
B. At all street intersections, no obstruction to vision (other than an
existing building, post, column, hedge, wall or tree) exceeding 30
inches in height above the established grade of the street at the
property line shall be erected or maintained within the area bounded by
the line drawn between points along each such street line 30 feet
distant from their intersection or 20 feet distant from the
commencement of the radius, whichever is greater.
A. Residential density requirements. Residential development densities of
a planned residential development for townhouse or multifamily
construction shall not exceed an average gross density of 8.75 dwelling
units per acre of gross site area. Residential development proposed for
single-family detached housing shall require 18,000 square feet of land
as a minimum lot size and shall otherwise conform to the provisions of
the A Residence District, except that the minimum front yard setback
for such one-family units may be reduced to not less than 35 feet by the
Joint Planning Board on site plan review where the rear of the lots so
reduced abut a residence zone district.
B. Distribution of residential units.
(1) Within a planned residential development, the distribution of
residential dwelling units shall be as provided herein:
(a) Single-family detached dwellings on lots of 18,000 square feet:
up to 10% of total units.
(b) Townhouse or multifamily dwellings: up to 100% of total units.
(2) Where a landowner can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Joint
Planning Board that the provisions of Subsection B(1) cannot be
complied with due to unusual physical constraints of the property,
such as exceptional topographic or geologic condition or other
extraordinary and exceptional situation or condition, including the
prevailing housing market, the Joint Planning Board shall have the
right to modify the distribution requirements, but no provision
hereof shall be construed to authorize modification increasing the
density permitted above.
§ 142-95 JUNKYARDS § 142-97
138:415
§ 142-97. Distances between buildings.
The minimum distance between any two buildings shall be not less than 1/
3 the average height of the buildings involved at their closest proximities,
except that the Joint Planning Board, on site plan review, may require a
greater minimum distance, but not more than the average height of the
buildings involved at their closest proximities or 12 feet, whichever is
greater, where such greater distance is determined by the Joint Planning
Board to be necessary to provide adequate access for the building or
buildings.
§ 142-98. Maximum height of buildings.
The maximum height of buildings shall not exceed two habitable stories,
and the height thereof shall not in any event exceed 35 feet, including
roof mechanical equipment, measured at any point of the adjacent finished
grade at the building line.
§ 142-99. Common recreation areas.
A. The minimum required area for common recreation and open space use
shall be as follows: a minimum of three square feet of common
recreation and open space use shall be provided for each one square
foot of actual building area, exclusive of parking areas.
B. Said common recreation and open space areas shall not include any
recreational facility where outside or private membership is required
excluding the residents who reside therein, but this provision shall not
be construed to require that residents of single-family dwelling units
within or without the Planned Residential District be included or have
the use of the recreational facilities. All residents other than the owners
and occupants of single-family dwelling units shall have the right to use
and enjoy the common recreation areas and facilities without separate
charge, unless application is made to the Joint Planning Board for relief
from the provisions of this section. The Joint Planning Board is
authorized by resolution to grant exceptions from the requirements of
this section where special circumstances of particular occupancies are
demonstrated not requiring use by individual occupants of the
recreational facilities provided. No provision hereof shall be deemed to
preclude reasonable rules and regulations for the management and use
of such recreational facilities and for the enforcement thereof, and no
provisions hereof shall be deemed to preclude the waiver, without
application to the municipality, evidenced by an express written
contract or lease, of the right to use and enjoy the common recreation
areas and facilities; provided, however, that individual waivers not be
obtained from more than 8% of the total dwelling units within the
Planned Residential Districts without the municipal application
referred to above.
C. Recreational leases or similar charging arrangements shall be
prohibited unless disclosed in advance to and approved by the Joint

Improvements and Services
§ 142-115. Utility improvements.
§ 142-116. Garbage and trash services.
This Part 4 shall not be construed as requiring the municipality to provide
garbage, refuse or trash removal service to the occupants of a planned
development. On the contrary, garbage, refuse and trash removal and
disposal services shall be arranged for by or on behalf of the occupants
of a planned residential development privately, on the same basis as such
services are contracted for by the owners of single-family residences within
the Township of River Vale. The developer's agreement shall contain
provisions respecting garbage, refuse and trash removal services designed
to ensure that the same will be provided to the occupants on a basis
substantially similar to that provided for other residents of the Township of
River Vale.
§ 142-117. Snow and ice removal.
Common parking areas, spaces and driveways within a Planned Residential
District shall be kept free of snow and ice, and a common arrangement shall
be made for or on behalf of the occupants thereof requiring snowplowing
and snow and ice removal from common parking areas, spaces and
driveways not later than 24 hours after the accumulation thereof. The
developer's agreement shall provide accordingly and shall contain
provisions pursuant to which the Township may elect to remedy a failure
A. Every planned development shall be serviced with a comprehensive
water and sewage distribution and disposal system.
B. All utility improvements, including storm drainage systems, sanitary
sewage collection and disposal and water supply systems, shall be in
accordance with standards and procedures established by municipal,
county and state regulations. Said improvements shall be subject to
review and approval by the Township Engineer and Township Board of
Health, as well as appropriate county and state agencies. Water supply
facilities and fire hydrants shall be subject to review and approval by
the Board of Fire Rating Organization of New Jersey and the Township
Fire Prevention Bureau.
C. Electric, gas and telephone services, if available, shall be provided by
the developer in concert with the appropriate public utilities providing
such service. Said services shall be provided as a part of an
underground system. Energy conservation systems shall be employed
whenever practicable.

manner as other real estate taxes.
§ 142-118. Street improvements.
Monuments, street names and other traffic control devices and signs, shade
trees, streetlights, sidewalks, curbs, fire hydrants and all aspects of street
construction, as well as other improvements, shall be subject to municipal
regulations and review and approval by the Township Engineer in the light
of current standards and specifications.

ARTICLE XXIII
Landscaping Standards
§ 142-119. Purpose.
Emphasis shall be placed upon landscaping as a means of achieving beauty,
safety and convenience in the community. Landscaping shall be designed in
such a manner as to impart its aesthetic character when viewed from an
area accessible to the public or from adjacent properties. It will be required
on all projects. The location, nature and height of walls and fences and the
nature and extent of the landscaping on the sites shall be such that the
use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of
adjacent land and buildings.
§ 142-120. Integration into overall design.
Landscaping design and planning shall be integrated into the overall design
and shall not be considered as an afterthought. Proposed landscape design
schemes shall be evaluated in their relationship to the existing natural
landscape or to the developed or proposed landscape, including those on
adjacent properties. The existing natural landscape character shall be
preserved whenever possible and practical.
§ 142-121. Items other than plantings.
Landscaping includes not only the design and installation of plant material
but also paving, benches, fountains, exterior lighting fixtures, fences and
other items of outdoor furniture serving the pedestrian. The design of these
items shall complement the total design of the space. No advertising will
be allowed on any exposed amenity or facility such as benches and trash
containers.
§ 142-122. Landscaping as screening of objectionable areas.
One of the uses of landscaping will be to screen, to buffer and to accentuate
boundaries and to involve the masking out or concealing of any
objectionable area. The achievement of this is left to the designer, whether
by walls, fences, mounds of earth or vegetation. Screening shall be
employed to mask from the public view or adjacent properties such service
areas as trash and garbage areas, outside equipment of an unaesthetic
character and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping with
the aesthetics of the project or neighborhood.
§ 142-123. Conditions for issuance of certificate of occupancy.
All landscaping and plantings designated on the plans shall be of specified
height and shall be installed and growing in a healthy condition before a
certificate of occupancy is issued.

ARTICLE XXIV
Administrative Procedures
§ 142-124. Administrative authority; statutory findings.
In accordance with Part 1, Land Use Generally, of this chapter the Joint
Planning Board of the Township of River Vale shall administer this Part 4.
Prior to approval of a planned residential development, the Joint Planning
Board shall make each of the findings required to be made and referred
to in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45. Except as may be inconsistent with this Part 4 all
remaining provisions of the Part 8 (Subdivision of Land), Part 6 (Site Plan
Review) and Part 9 (Zoning) shall govern and control in the processing,
review and approval of a planned residential development. The following
procedures shall also apply.
§ 142-125. Final site plan approval required.
Final site plan approval by the Joint Planning Board shall constitute the
specific land use, extent and intensity of development permitted by Part
9, Zoning, of this chapter. No building permit shall be issued prior to
final site plan approval without written authorization of the Joint Planning
Board, execution of the developer's agreement and filing and approval of
performance guaranties.
§ 142-126. Site plan and subdivision approval applicable.
All provisions of Part 1, Land Use Generally, of this chapter, regarding
site plan and subdivision approval shall be deemed applicable to planned
residential developments unless the context clearly renders such
procedures, standards or requirements inapplicable or unless specifically
waived or modified by the Joint Planning Board.
§ 142-127. Additional procedure for flexibility.
In order to encourage and promote flexibility and economy in layout and
design, the following additional procedures shall apply:
A. Within 90 days of the date of the application for site plan approval, the
Joint Planning Board shall inform the applicant, in writing, as to
whether filing requirements for preliminary approval have been met. If
so, the application shall be deemed complete. Within 45 days of such
certification by the Joint Planning Board of the completed application,
the Joint Planning Board shall hold a public hearing thereon and shall
grant preliminary approval with or without conditions or deny the
proposed site plan. Should the Joint Planning Board disapprove the site
plan at the preliminary stage, the applicant may reapply with a revised
or modified proposal. The purpose of said preliminary application,
which may be in tentative form for discussion purposes, shall be to
promote mutual agreement between the applicant and the Joint
Planning Board on the basic scheme of the planned development and to
§ 142-124 JUNKYARDS § 142-127
138:427
§ 142-128. Joint Planning Board findings.
Prior to approval of a planned development, the Joint Planning Board shall
find, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45, that:
set direction for the required additional review and agreements leading
to final site plan approval.
B. The information required hereby and by Part 6, Site Plan Review, of this
chapter, for preliminary approval shall be submitted in tentative form
for discussion purposes. Such information shall include preliminary
architectural floor plans and building facades and elevations. If the
Joint Planning Board finds said application to be not in accordance with
the Planned Development District requirements or if the Joint Planning
Board requires any substantial amendment in the layout of
improvements proposed by the developer that have been the subject of
a hearing, an amended application for development shall be submitted
and proceeded upon as in the case of the original application for
development. Preliminary approval shall authorize the applicant to
submit an application for final approval.
C. Within three years from the date of preliminary approval, with or
without conditions, the applicant may submit a complete application for
final approval in compliance with the conditions and stipulations
established by the Joint Planning Board in granting preliminary
approval. Within 45 days after submission of a complete final
application, the Joint Planning Board, if it determines that a further
exploration of facts would be in the public interest, shall have the power
to hold a public hearing and shall grant final site plan approval with or
without conditions or shall deny the application. In making its
determination, the Joint Planning Board may permit deviations, not
deemed by the Joint Planning Board to be substantial, from the
conditions of preliminary approval necessitated by changed conditions
or circumstances of the developer since the date of preliminary
approval. If it determines that substantial changes in the terms of
approval are required, the Joint Planning Board may grant the same,
but in such case a public hearing shall be required to be held on notice,
as in the case of preliminary approval.
D. In the course of site plan approval, the Joint Planning Board may allow
for or permit greater or lesser concentrations of density or intensity of
land use within a section or sections of development than in others,
provided that the maximum density provided for the district as a whole
is not exceeded.
E. Prior to or as a condition of final approval, the Joint Planning Board
shall set forth any requirements for timing of development among the
various types of uses and subgroups.
A. Any departures by the proposed development from zoning regulations
otherwise applicable to the subject property conform to and comply
§ 142-127 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-128
138:428
with Part 9, Zoning, standards established for the Planned Development
District within which the subject property is located.
B. Any common open space designated on the site plan has been
adequately reserved as to amount, location, purpose, ownership and
maintenance for the use and benefit of the owners or residents in the
planned development and that the proposed common open space, if
adequate, and the proposals for maintenance and conservation of said
common open space are reliable.
C. The physical design proposed for public services, vehicular and
pedestrian traffic control and the amenities of light and air, recreation
and visual enjoyment, all created by the interrelationship of these
development aspects and other requirements of site plan review, will
result in an adequate development.
D. There will be no unreasonable, adverse impact upon the neighborhood
in which the planned development is proposed to be established.
E. In cases of developments contemplating construction over a period of
years, the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the
public and of the residents, occupants and owners of the proposed
development in its total completion are adequate.

ARTICLE XXV
Miscellaneous Provisions
§ 142-129. Additional planning standards.
A. The site in general.
(1) The proposed location of main and accessory buildings on the site
and their relation to one another, traffic circulation within the site,
height and bulk of buildings, provision of utilities such as water,
sewer, power and telephone, disposition or disposal of solid and
fluid wastes, provision of off-street parking space, provision of
buffer areas and other open spaces on the site and the display of
signs and external lighting shall be such that any development will
adequately handle pedestrian and vehicular traffic within the site
and in relation to the street system adjoining and will harmoniously
and satisfactorily fit in with contiguous land and buildings and
adjacent neighborhoods. Attention shall be paid to the preservation
of historic places and artifacts. In addition, the Joint Planning
Board shall consider the factors of drainage, road alignment and
other engineering aspects of such site plan and may require the
review of such factors by engineering authorities appointed by the
Township.
(2) The location and size of the use, the nature and intensity of the
operations involved in or conducted in connection with it, the size
of the site in relation to it and the location of the site with respect to
streets giving access to it shall be such that it will be in harmony
with the appropriate and orderly development of the district in
which it is located.
B. Buildings.
(1) Buildings or structures which are a part of a present or future
group or complex shall have a unity of character and design. They
shall be designed and constructed of materials which help to
achieve visual harmony with the surroundings. All exterior walls
visible to public or adjacent property shall be designed to create a
harmonious whole. Materials shall express their function clearly
and shall not appear as a material foreign to the rest of the building
or artificial to that intended. It is not to be inferred that buildings
must look alike or be of the same style to be harmonious. Harmony
can be achieved through the proper consideration of scale,
proportions, site planning, landscaping, materials and color.
Buildings which are of symbolic design for reasons of advertising
and buildings which are not compatible with the atmosphere and
character will not be allowed. Symbols attached to buildings will
not be allowed unless they are secondary in appearance to the
building and are an aesthetic asset to the building project and the
neighborhood. The relationship of forms to the use, texture and
color of materials shall be such as to create a harmonious whole.
§ 142-129 JUNKYARDS § 142-129
138:431
§ 142-130. Special requirements.
When the area involved forms an integral part of, is immediately
adjacent to or otherwise clearly affects the future of any
established section of the Township, the design scale and location
on the site shall enhance rather than detract from the character,
value and attractiveness of the surroundings.
(2) Exterior lighting may be used to illuminate a building and its
grounds for safety purposes, but in an aesthetic manner. Lighting is
not to be used as a form of advertising in a manner that is not
compatible to the neighborhood or in a manner that draws
considerably more attention to the building or grounds at night
than in the day. Lighting following the form of the building or part
of the building will not be allowed if the overall effect will be garish
or detrimental to the environment. All fixtures used in exterior
lighting are to be selected for functional and aesthetic value.
(3) All exterior structures, attached or not to buildings, shall be in
harmony with and secondary to the buildings. Aesthetically, they
shall be an asset to the site and to the neighborhood. All vending
machines or any facility dispensing merchandise or a service shall
be confined to a space built into the building or buildings or
enclosed in a separate structure compatible with the main building.
A. Common recreation areas and open space ownership. The landowner or
developer shall provide for and establish an organization for the
ownership and maintenance of any common recreation areas and open
space, and such organization shall not be dissolved nor shall it dispose
of any of same by sale or otherwise (except to an organization
conceived and established to own and maintain the common recreation
areas and planned development open space) without the written
consent and approval of the governing body of the Township of River
Vale. Before dissolving and before disposing of any open space, the
organization shall first be required to offer to dedicate the open space
to the municipality, in accordance with the provisions of N.J.S.A.
40:55D-43.
B. Continuous maintenance of common recreation areas and open space.
In the event that such organization shall fail to maintain the open space
in reasonable order and condition, the Joint Planning Board may serve
written notice upon such organization or upon the owners of the
development setting forth the manner in which the organization has
failed to maintain the open space in reasonable condition, and said
notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies of maintenance be
cured within 35 days thereof and shall state the date and place of a
hearing thereon which shall be held within 15 days of the notice. At
such hearing, the Joint Planning Board may modify the terms of the
original notice as to deficiencies and may give a reasonable extension of
time, not to exceed 65 days, within which they shall be cured. If the
deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in the modification thereof
§ 142-129 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-130
138:432
§ 142-131. Public hearing.
An application for preliminary plan approval of a planned unit development
shall require a public hearing. When a hearing date has been set by the Joint
Planning Board, the applicant shall notify by registered or certified mail, at
least 10 days prior to the hearing, all property owners within 200 feet of
the extreme limits of the proposed planned development area. Said notice
shall state the date, time and place of hearing and that a brief description
of the proposed development has been filed with the Township Clerk for
public inspection. The applicant shall furnish proof of notification to the
Joint Planning Board at the time of the hearing. All notice and publication
shall not be cured within said 35 days or any permitted extension
thereof, the municipality, in order to preserve the open space and
maintain the same for a period of one year, may enter upon and
maintain such land. Said entry and maintenance shall not vest in the
public any rights to use the open space except when the same is
voluntarily dedicated to the public by the owners. Before the expiration
of said year, the Joint Planning Board shall, upon its initiative or upon
the request of the organization theretofore responsible for the
maintenance of the open space, call a public hearing upon 15 days'
written notice to such organization and to the owners of the
development, to be held by the Joint Planning Board, at which hearing
such organization and the owners of the development shall show cause
why such maintenance by the Township shall not, at the election of
the Township, continue for a succeeding year. If the Joint Planning
Board shall determine that such organization is ready and able to
maintain said open space in reasonable condition, the Township shall
cease to maintain said open space at the end of said year. If the Joint
Planning Board shall determine such organization is not ready and able
to maintain said open space in a reasonable condition, the Township
may, in its discretion, continue to maintain said open space during the
next succeeding year, subject to a similar hearing and determination
in each year thereafter. The decision of the Joint Planning Board in
any such case shall constitute a final administrative decision subject
to judicial review. If the Joint Planning Board determines that the
proceedings mentioned hereinabove should be referred to the Township
Council, it is empowered to do so, and the Township Council shall
thereafter have the same powers and be subject to the same
restrictions as provided in this subsection.

Design Standards
§ 142-156. General requirements.
In reviewing any site plan, the approving authority, all advisory boards and
professional advisers shall be guided by the design standards contained
herein. The following standards shall be utilized by the Joint Planning Board
in reviewing all site plans. These standards are intended to provide a frame
of reference for the applicant in the development of site and building plans,
as well as a method of review for the reviewing authority. These standards
shall not be regarded as inflexible requirements. They are not intended to
discourage creativity, invention and innovation. The specification of one or
more particular architectural styles is not included in these standards:
A. Drives, parking and circulation.
(1) The review of the site plan shall consider pedestrian and vehicular
traffic movement within and adjacent to the site, with particular
emphasis on the provision and layout of parking areas, off-street
loading and unloading, movement of people, goods and vehicles
from access roads within the site and between buildings and
vehicles.
(2) All parking spaces shall be usable, and safely and conveniently
arranged access to the site from adjacent roads shall be designed
so as to interfere as little as possible with traffic flow on these roads
and to permit vehicles a rapid and safe ingress and egress to the
site. Treatment and design of proposed screening of parking areas
and drives shall be shown, and the site plan shall provide special
attention to the separation of pedestrian, bicycle and vehicular
traffic.
B. Building design and layout.
(1) The design and layout of buildings and parking areas shall be
reviewed so as to provide an aesthetically pleasing design and
efficient arrangement. Particular attention shall be given to safety
and fire protection; impact on surrounding development,
contiguous and adjacent buildings and lands; and environmental
and ecological considerations.
(2) Proposed structures shall be related harmoniously to the terrain
and to existing buildings in the vicinity that have a visual
relationship to the proposed buildings. The achievement of such
relationship may include the enclosure of space in conjunction with
other existing buildings or other proposed buildings and the
creation of focal points with respect to avenues of approach, terrain
features or other buildings. Whenever practicable, buildings shall
be separated from parking areas by not less than 25 feet unless
access for fire-fighting equipment is otherwise provided.
§ 142-156 JUNKYARDS § 142-156
138:455
C. Lighting. Adequate lighting shall be provided to ensure safe movement
of persons and vehicles and for security purposes. Directional lights
shall be arranged so as to minimize glare and reflection on adjacent
properties.
D. Buffering. Buffering, where required, shall be located around the
perimeter of the site to minimize headlights of vehicles, noise, light
from structures, the movement of people and vehicles and to shield
activities from adjacent properties. Buffering may consist of fencing,
evergreens, shrubs, bushes, deciduous trees or combinations thereof to
achieve the stated objectives.
E. Landscaping.
(1) Landscaping shall be provided as part of the overall site plan
designed and integrated into building arrangements, topography,
parking and buffering requirements. Landscaping shall include
trees, bushes, shrubs, ground cover, perennials, annuals, plants,
sculpture, art, street furniture and the use of building and paving
materials in an imaginative manner.
(2) The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as
practicable and, where desirable, by minimizing tree and soil
removal. Any grade changes shall be in keeping with the general
appearance of neighboring developed areas. Treatment and design
of proposed screening shall be shown and shall be such as may be
maintained throughout the year. Areas of the lot not occupied by
buildings, parking or walkways shall be planted with grass, shrubs
or other decorative landscaping.
F. Surface water drainage. Special attention shall be given to proper site
surface drainage so that removal of surface waters shall not adversely
affect neighboring properties or the public storm drainage system and
so that the runoff stormwaters from the site generally will be
minimized, including by retention facilities if deemed necessary.
Stormwater shall be removed from all roofs, canopies and paved areas
and carried away in swales or in an underground drainage system.
Surface water in all paved areas shall be collected at intervals so that it
will not obstruct the flow of vehicular or pedestrian traffic and will not
create puddles or the menace of ice or other hazardous conditions.
G. Utilities. [Amended 12-28-1989 by Ord. No. 0-17-89]
(1) Electric and telephone lines shall be underground. Any utility
installation remaining above the ground shall be located so as to

138:456
within a minimum setback of 25 feet from the center line of a
natural gas or liquefied gas transmission line or within 25 feet
of overhead electric or other high-tension lines. In respect of
overhead or aerial lines, the setback shall be measured from a
line drawn vertically from the outer edge of any overhead electric
or other high-tension line or from any supporting structure or
stanchion supporting an overhead powerline.
H. Signs. The size, location, design, color, texture, lighting and materials
of all permanent signs and outdoor advertising structures or features
shall not detract from the design of proposed buildings and structures
and the surrounding properties, nor create confusion with traffic signs
or any other signs. Off-site directional signs shall conform to the
foregoing. Buildings, structures or building features shall not be such
as constitute the substantial equivalent of a sign or advertisement and
shall not represent a corporate identity.
I. Special features. Exposed storage areas, exposed or hidden machinery
installations on all levels, service areas, truck loading areas, utility
buildings and structures and similar accessory areas and structures
shall be subject to such setbacks, screen plantings or other screening
methods as shall reasonably be required to prevent their being
incongruous with the existing or contemplated environment and the
surrounding properties.
J. Sanitary and solid waste disposal.
(1) Sanitary waste disposal, water supply and solid waste disposal
shall be reviewed and considered. Particular emphasis shall be
given to the adequacy of existing systems and the need for
improvements to adequately carry runoff and sewage and maintain
an adequate supply of water at sufficient pressure.

construction. On relevant land as defined herein, it is the intent of this
article for the applicant's professional design consultants to prepare and
submit plans which consider and place a design priority on the preservation
of existing vegetation and in particular, trees. It is the further intent of
this article that roadway alignment, building placement, proposed grading,
utility installations and other site improvements be planned and designed
with the preservation of existing trees as a major consideration. The ability
to maximize or increase development density shall not be a legitimate cause
to justify relief from provisions of this article.

ARTICLE XLIII
Procedure
§ 142-195. Submission of sketch plat.
A. Any owner of land within River Vale shall, prior to subdividing or
resubdividing land, as defined in this Part 8, submit to the Secretary of
the Joint Planning Board, or the designated official, at least two weeks
prior to the regular meeting of the Board an original and eight black-onwhite
prints of a sketch plat of the proposed subdivision, together with
three completed application forms, for purposes of classification and
preliminary discussion. At the time of submission a fee of $250 shall be
paid to the Township Clerk, as well as a deposit of $500 for costs.
[Amended 4-14-1969; 8-26-2004 by Ord. No. 0-9-04]
B. The Joint Planning Board, for the purpose of minor subdivision approval
procedure, is hereby empowered to waive full notice and hearing in all
those cases in which the Subdivision Committee of the Joint Planning
Board, appointed by the Chairman with the approval of the Board,
unanimously find no cause for review of the sketch plat by the entire
Board or for unfavorable action upon the subdivision. In such cases, the
Subdivision Committee shall classify and approve said sketch plat as a
minor subdivision. Such finding shall be deemed approval and a
notation to the effect shall be made on the sketch plat and signed by the
Chairman of the Board or Chairman of the Subdivision Committee. In
the event that County Planning Board approval is required, the sketch
plat shall first be forwarded to that Board for its consideration. Except
where Joint Planning Board approval is necessary, the Secretary of the
Joint Planning Board shall return the plan to the subdivider within one
week following the meeting at which approval was granted. The failure
of the Subdivision Committee to act upon the matter within one week
following the meeting at which such sketch plat is presented shall be
deemed to constitute disapproval.
C. Copies.
(1) Before the Municipal Clerk returns any approved sketch plat to the
subdivider, the owner shall furnish the original and eight copies, at
least one of which shall be sent to the following:
(a) Municipal Clerk.
(b) Municipal Engineer.
(c) Building Inspector or Zoning Officer.
(d) Tax Assessor.
(e) Secretary of the Joint Planning Board.
(f) County Planning Board.
§ 142-195 JUNKYARDS § 142-195
138:497
§ 142-196. Submission of preliminary plat.
(2) The cost of the copies will be charged to the subdivider and shall be
collected before the return of the original sketch plat to the
subdivider.
D. Either a deed description or plat map drawn in compliance with N.J.S.A.
46:23-9.9 et seq. shall be filed by the subdivider with the county
recording officer within 90 days from the date of return of the approved
sketch plat.
E. If the plat is classified as a major subdivision, a notation to that effect
shall be made on the plat, which will be returned to the subdivider for
compliance with the procedure in §§ 142-196 and 142-197 of this
article.
F. When, in the opinion of the Joint Planning Board, undue hardship would
result from strict compliance with the major subdivision approval
procedure, the general purpose and intent of the rules, regulations and
standards established by this Part 8 would not be impaired, and no new
street or extension of a street is shown, the Joint Planning Board is
hereby empowered to authorize prosecution and disposition of the
application as a minor subdivision, provided that the Board shall not, in
any case in which an application has originally been classified as major,
waive full notice, hearing or the filing fees and deposit for costs
applicable to major subdivisions. [Added 8-14-1969]
G. In addition to the requirements of Subsection D, the original plat of a
minor subdivision or of any subdivision approved pursuant to the
provisions of Subsection F shall, upon execution, remain on file in the
office of the Township Clerk as a permanent public record of the action
of the Board, together with any official minutes or resolutions of the
Board pertaining thereto. [Added 8-14-1969]
A. At least six black-on-white prints of the preliminary plat, together with
three completed application forms for preliminary approval, shall be
submitted to the Township Clerk two weeks prior to the Joint Planning
Board meeting at which consideration is desired. At the time of
submission, fees are to be paid by the applicant as follows: A fee of $500
plus $50 per lot shall be paid to the Township Clerk as an additional
filing fee. In addition, there shall be made a deposit for costs of an
additional $1,500 plus $50 per lot. Any portion of the deposit for costs
not expended shall be returned to the subdivider. The Township Clerk
shall immediately notify the Secretary of the Joint Planning Board of the
receipt of the preliminary plat fees. [Amended 8-26-2004 by Ord. No.
0-9-04]
B. The Secretary of the Joint Planning Board shall notify by mail at least
five days prior to the hearing all property owners within 200 feet of the
extreme limits of the subdivision as their names appear on the
municipal tax record. Said notice shall state the time and place of

subdivision has been filed with the Municipal Clerk for public
inspection. The Secretary shall also cause notice of the hearing to

days after submission to the Municipal Clerk, but in no case before the
expiration of the twenty-day period within which the County Planning
Board may submit a report on said subdivision. In all cases the
recommendation of the County Board shall be given careful
consideration in the final decision of the local Joint Planning Board. If
the County Planning Board has approval authority pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:27-12,52 its action shall be noted on the plat, and, if disapproved, two
copies of the reasons for disapproval shall be returned with the plat. If
either the Joint Planning Board or County Planning Board disapprove a
plat, the reasons for disapproval shall be remedied prior to further
consideration. The person submitting a plat shall be notified of the
action of the Planning Board within 90 days of its submission. If
approval is required by any other officer or public body, the same
procedure as applies to submission and approval by the County
Planning Board shall apply.
E. If the Joint Planning Board acts favorably on a preliminary plat, the
Chairman of the Joint Planning Board shall affix his signature to the plat
with a notation that it has received preliminary approval and return it to
the subdivider for compliance with final approval requirements.
F. Preliminary approval of a major subdivision shall confer upon the
applicant the rights established by Section 37 of P.L. 1975, c. 291
(N.J.S.A. 40:55D-49), as the same may be amended from time to time,
for a period of three years from the date on which the resolution of
preliminary approval is adopted or for such extended periods as
provided therein. [Amended 4-22-1993 by Ord. No. 0-1-93]
52.Editor's Note: Repealed by L. 1968, c. 285.
§ 142-196 JUNKYARDS § 142-197
138:499
A. At the time specified in the Subsection B, a builder's agreement shall be
entered into between the owner and subdivider and the Joint Planning
Board and Township Council of River Vale. Said agreement shall
specifically detail all items of public improvements to be performed, the
amounts of bonds to be furnished, other requirements of the Joint
Planning Board and all other items as agreed and stipulated between
the owner and subdivider and the governing body and Joint Planning
Board of the Township of River Vale. Said agreement shall be prepared
by the Joint Planning Board and approved by the Township Council.
B. At the time of the granting of preliminary approval and before
commencement of improvements or soil-moving operations, the Joint
Planning Board may require the posting of a performance guaranty, as
approved by the Joint Planning Board Attorney, in an amount not to
exceed 120% of the cost of the public improvements and work as
required by the Joint Planning Board, which cost shall be determined by
the Township Engineer according to the method of calculation set forth
in Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4). The Township
Engineer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements
covered by the performance guaranty, which itemized cost estimate
shall be appended to each performance guaranty posted by the obligor.
The Joint Planning Board shall require that a sum not in excess of 10%
of such estimated cost shall be posted with the Township as a cash
performance bond. Subject to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 and
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2, as the same may be amended from time to time,
the Joint Planning Board shall require that a sum equal to 7% of such
estimated cost, or $1,250, whichever is greater, be deposited with the
Township before commencement of operations to cover the expenses
incurred and to be incurred by the Township for engineering services
and legal expenses in connection with the subdivision and application
and in connection with the inspection and certification of improvements
within the development, but in no instance shall the deposit required
exceed a reasonable amount in light of the scale and complexity of the
development. In the event that the expenses incurred for engineering
services and legal expenses exceed the balance held by the Township
for such purposes, then the Township Administrator shall notify the
subdivider or developer that further moneys must be deposited. The
Joint Planning Board shall take no further action on the application
unless and until this further deposit is made. The builder's agreement
shall provide that if the Township's approved expenses for such
purposes shall exceed the amount deposited, the subdivider or
developer shall pay such excess amount to the Township, and shall
further provide that any portion of the deposit for costs not required to
be expended for such purposes shall be refunded to the subdivider or
developer, as the case may be. No such deposit shall be charged with an
amount unless the same shall represent a reimbursement to the
Township for payments by it for services rendered, upon proper
vouchers, as provided by law. In every case, any charge to the deposit
provided for herein shall be reviewed and approved by the municipality
as to the necessity for the performance of the service and the
§ 142-197 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-197
138:500
reasonableness of the amount charged therefor, to the same extent
as if there were no provision for reimbursement to the Township and
in light of the standards set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.2 governing
escrow payments for professional services. The Township Engineer
shall perform the following inspections in connection with the
certifications of improvements within the development: [Amended
4-22-1993 by Ord. No. 0-1-93]
(1) Prior to the start of any excavation work, the developer shall notify
the Township Engineer. At the time, the Township Engineer shall
inspect the construction location and grade stakes, original ground
conditions and weather conditions and shall decide whether work
is to proceed or be delayed.
(2) During rough grade work, the Township Engineer shall conduct
periodic inspection of work progress and investigate any
subsurface conditions that are encountered. If, during the course of
construction, unforeseen conditions, such as springs, aquifer
layers, high groundwater tables and miscellaneous unknowns are
encountered, it shall be determined by the Township Engineer
whether or not the developer shall install additional catch basins,
storm drains, french drains or any other drainage appurtenances.
(3) The Township Engineer shall inspect all drainage trenches and
storm-drain pipes prior to any backfilling of the trenches. The
storm-drain pipes, pipe joints and pipe bedding shall be backfilled
and tamped in accordance with standard specifications approved
by the Township Engineer.
(4) The Township Engineer shall inspect excavation, subbase and
pouring of curbs and sidewalks. Said construction shall conform to
plans and specifications, the approved maps and Township
specifications and regulations.
(5) The tickets for deliveries on the site of materials or supplies may be
inspected to determine the quantities used.
(6) The Township Engineer shall inspect and check the materials and
amount of said materials used for the subbase material. Said
materials shall conform to the requirements as set forth on the
plans and specifications and to Township specifications and
requirements. When approval is given by the Township Engineer,
the work may proceed.
(7) The Township Engineer shall inspect final pavement construction
work during the course of said construction. The pavement shall be
constructed in accordance with the requirements as set forth on
the plans and specifications, the approved maps and Township
specifications and regulations.
§ 142-197 JUNKYARDS § 142-197
138:501
(8) The Township Engineer shall inspect the site of grading of
individual lots so as to avoid dangerous conditions or the creation
of low spots on lawns, driveways and other areas.
(9) The installation of concrete monuments shall be inspected by the
Township Engineer.
(10) Utilities shall be inspected by the Township Engineer in
conjunction with the various utility companies concerned.
(11) The Township Engineer shall inspect the installation of shade trees
in conjunction with a member of the Shade Tree Committee.
C. Any and all moneys posted by the developer or subdivider as a deposit
for costs of the Township's professional engineering and legal expenses
shall be deemed a credit to reduce by such amount the required posting
of 7% of the cost of construction of subdivision improvements. The
balance of any remaining moneys on deposit with the Township of River
Vale shall be refunded to the applying parties at any time following
expiration of 60 days from the receipt by the Township Clerk of the
certification of the Board Secretary that all costs and expenses of the
Township arising out of or due to the subdivision applicant have been
paid or sufficient provision therefor has otherwise been made.
D. A deposit of $50 to the Township of River Vale shall be made for each
concrete monument as shown on the plat and not actually in place,
which moneys shall be refunded to the owner on demand after the
monuments have been set by the owner's engineer to the satisfaction of
the Township Engineer. If the monuments are not set within 30 days
after written notice to the owners by the Township Engineer, the
Township shall retain said moneys as liquidated damages, and the
governing body shall then direct the Township Engineer to place the
monuments. The Township, at its option, may, in lieu of the above
deposit, accept a bond approved by the Board Attorney. [Amended
8-26-2004 by Ord. No. 0-9-04]
E. Prior to release of the performance bond, the applicant shall file with
the Township Engineer as-built drawings, in ink, on tracing cloth to
such scale as required by the Township Engineer, accurately showing
the location, profile, size and appurtenances of all storm drains, catch
basins, septic tanks and septic systems, sanitary sewers and water
mains and all utilities, including service connections, constructed
within the subdivision. Such as-built drawings shall be and become the
property and public record of the Township of River Vale. Upon
submission of the as-built tracings to the Township Engineer and upon
the improvements being completed, installed and accepted by the
Township and upon compliance with the law and upon the performance
of all other terms of the builder's agreement, the Township Council,
after review and recommendation by the Joint Planning Board, shall
release the performance bond, provided that a maintenance bond in an
amount not to exceed 15% of the cost of the public improvements and

8-14-1969; 4-22-1993 by Ord. No. 0-1-93]
work, or of the original installation, is posted, which cost shall be
determined by the Township Engineer according to the method of
calculation set forth in Section 15 of P.L. 1991, c. 256 (N.J.S.A
40:55D-53.4). The maintenance bond shall be reviewed for form and
approved by the Joint Planning Board Attorney and shall run for a
period not to exceed two years from final acceptance of the
improvement. [Amended 4-22-1993 by Ord. No. 0-1-93]
A. The final plat shall be submitted to the Municipal Clerk for forwarding
to the Joint Planning Board for final approval within three years from
the date of preliminary approval. The Municipal Clerk shall immediately
notify the Secretary of the Joint Planning Board upon receipt of a final
plat, and the Joint Planning Board shall act upon the final plat within 45
days after the date of submission for final approval to the Municipal
Clerk.
B. The original tracing, one translucent tracing, cloth copy, two cloth
prints, six black-on-white prints and three copies of the application form
for final approval shall be submitted to the Secretary of the Joint
Planning Board at least two weeks prior to the date of a regular meeting
of the Joint Planning Board. At the time of submission, fees are to be
paid to the Township Clerk by the applicant as follows: A filing fee of
$500 plus $100 per lot. Unless the preliminary plat has been approved
without changes, the final plat shall incorporate all changes or
modifications required by the Joint Planning Board. [Amended
8-26-2004 by Ord. No. 0-9-04]
C. The final plat shall be accompanied by a statement by the Municipal
Engineer that he is in receipt of a map showing all utilities in exact
location and elevation, identifying those portions already installed and
those to be installed, and that the subdivider has complied with one or
both of the following:
(1) Installed all improvements in accordance with the requirements of
these regulations.
(2) A performance guaranty has been posted with the Township Clerk
in sufficient amount to assure the completion of all required
improvements.

N.J.S.A. 40:27-1253 shall be forwarded to the County Planning Board for
its action prior to final approval by the Joint Planning Board.

E. If the Joint Planning Board approves the final plat, a notation to that
effect shall be made on each plat and shall be signed by the Chairman
and the Secretary of the Joint Planning Board.
F. Failure of the Joint Planning Board to act within the allotted time or a
mutually agreed upon extension shall be deemed to be favorable
approval, and the Municipal Clerk shall issue a certificate to that effect.
G. Upon final approval, copies of the final plat shall be filed by the Joint
Planning Board with the following:
(1) Municipal Clerk.
(2) Municipal Engineer.
(3) Building Inspector.
(4) Tax Assessor.
(5) County Planning Board.

developer with the county recording officer. The Joint Planning
Board may, for good cause shown, extend the period for recording
for an additional period not to exceed 190 days from the date of the
signing of the plat.
(2) The Joint Planning Board may extend the ninety-five-day or onehundred-
ninety-day period if the developer proves to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Joint Planning Board that the
developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from
filing because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals
from other governmental or quasi-governmental entities and that
the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued the
required approvals. The length of the extension shall be equal to
the period of delay caused by the wait for the required approvals,
as determined by the Joint Planning Board. The developer may
apply for the extension either before or after what would otherwise
be the expiration date.

§ 142-206. Standards.
The subdivision plat shall conform to design standards that will encourage
good development patterns within the municipality. Where either or both
an Official Map or Master Plan has or have been adopted, the subdivision
shall conform to the proposals and conditions shown thereon. The streets,
drainage rights-of-way, school sites, public parks and playgrounds shown
on an officially adopted Master Plan or Official Map shall be considered
an approval of subdivision plats. Where no Master Plan or Official Map
exists, streets and drainage rights-of-way shall be shown on the final plat
in accordance with Section 20 of Chapter 433 of the Laws of 195354 and
shall be such as to lend themselves to the harmonious development of
the municipality and enhance the public welfare in accordance with the
following design standards.
§ 142-207. Streets.
A. The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or Official
Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate extension of
existing streets.

shall be rounded at the curbline with a curve having a radius of not less
than 20 feet.
I. Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than 125 feet shall be
prohibited. This requirement shall be deemed to prohibit street offsets
in which the center lines are proposed to be aligned instead of offset.
[Amended 8-14-1969]
J. A tangent at least 100 feet long shall be introduced between reverse
curves on arterial and collector streets.
K. When connecting street lines deflect from each other at any one point
by more than 10° and not more than 45°, they shall be connected by a
curve with a radius of not less than 100 feet for minor streets and 300
feet for arterial and collector streets.
L. All changes in grade shall be connected by vertical curves of sufficient
radius to provide a smooth transition and proper sight distance.
M. Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac) shall not be longer than 600 feet and
shall provide a turnaround at the end with a radius of not less than 50
feet and tangent whenever possible to the right side of the street. If a
dead-end street is of a temporary nature, a similar turnaround shall be
provided and provisions made for future extension of the street and
reversion of the excess right-of-way to the adjoining properties.
N. No street shall have a name which will duplicate or so nearly duplicate
as to be confused with the names of existing streets. The continuation
of an existing street shall have the same name.

[2] A minimum of 10 feet of landscaping or grass area shall be
provided between the front elevation of each townhouse
unit and the common access drive, as measured from the
edge of pavement or sidewalk, if present. Paths or
walkways to individual front doors, utility easements and
driveways may occur in this area, but only if the dominant
amount of the area remains available to support significant
landscaping. At least one tree per unit front must be
provided.
[3] At least 30% of the total site area, exclusive of the golf
course, must be devoted to landscaping. No landscaped
strip or tree pocket smaller than 25 square feet may be
counted toward the total required landscaping. Utilities
may occur within required landscaping, but only if
underground utilities will not preclude appropriate
planting, including trees, and only if utilities are
adequately screened from view.
(f) Landscape buffers.
[1] Width and location. There shall be a minimum twenty-fivefoot-
wide opaque landscaped buffer provided along all
public road rights-of-way which completely visually
separates the residential component of the development.
Buffers shall consist of natural vegetation, earthen berms,
evergreen and pine trees, shrubs, deciduous trees,
decorative walls, fencing, or combinations thereof
designed to provide a year-round visual screen and
separation from the public roads.
[2] Required planting area. Total landscaping required within
the buffer is set forth below. Width for a buffer shall be
measured from the respective property line. Where buffers
turn at property corners, the length measurements
determining plant quantities are not required to overlap.
[3] Calculating required plantings. The total amount of
required landscaping within the required buffer shall be
calculated based on a point system. The point system, as
established below, ensures that a minimum level of
landscaping is achieved during development while
maintaining flexibility. When calculating points or
quantities of plants, fractions shall be rounded upward to
the higher whole number.

Medium shrub 2
Small shrub 1
[4] Points for individual vegetation in buffers:
[5] Existing healthy vegetation may be counted toward the
required landscaping, if it is used as a year-round sight
obstruction buffer. The Planning Board and Board
Engineer shall conduct site inspections in order to
determine whether the existing vegetation is useable as a
visual obstruction buffer. In order to do so, the landscape
plan shall indicate the type, number and size of existing
plants which are sufficient to comply with the respective
buffer yard. It shall not be necessary to indicate the total
inventory of existing plants. Only plants required to meet
the provisions of this section are required to be listed.
[a] The following minimum buffer planting standards
shall be used to provide year-round opaque screening:
[i] Planted earthen berm four feet high from the
existing ground surface.
[ii] Minimum number of large and small trees, one
per 40 linear feet.
[iii] Minimum number of points per linear feet of
buffer = 1.2.
(g) Vegetation size standards. The minimum allowable plant size
for new installations shall be as set forth herein. Due to the
variation between genus and species, the caliper or height
necessary for newly installed plant materials may vary.
[1] Large trees shall measure a minimum 2.5 inches in caliper
at chest height and be eight feet to 10 feet in height at the
time of planting.
[2] Small trees shall measure a minimum 1.5 inches to 2.5
inches in caliper at chest height for single-stem trees or
one inch to 1.5 inches in caliper for multistem trees, and at
least six feet to eight feet in height at the time of planting.
[3] Large shrubs shall measure a minimum of 3 1/2 feet to
four feet in height at the time of planting. Shrubs planted
for screening purposes shall form the required density to
§ 142-224 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-224
138:538
block visibility within three years from the date of
installation.
[4] Medium shrubs shall measure a minimum of two feet to
3 1/2 feet in height at the time of planting. A mix of
deciduous and evergreen shrubs is encouraged in order to
obtain a variety of color and texture throughout the year.
[5] Small shrubs shall measure a minimum of 18 inches to 24
inches in spread and/or height at the time of planting. A
mix of deciduous and evergreen shrubs is encouraged in
order to obtain a variety.
[6] Living ground covers shall provide 100% coverage on the
ground within one year of installation, except for mulch or
turf which shall provide 100% coverage upon installation.
Organic mulch may be used around plantings to maintain
soil moisture and prevent the growth of weeds, but cannot
be substituted for required plantings. Inorganic ground
covers consisting of river rock or similar materials may be
substituted for organic ground cover.
[7] All plant material, except ground covers, shall be approved
by the Planning Board. Consideration shall be given to the
environmental conditions of the site, such as soil,
topography, climate, microclimate, pattern of sun
movement, prevailing winds and precipitation, and air
movement to ensure that plant materials will be
established successfully. Tree selection for street yards, or
other locations within utility rights-of-way, shall consider
the presence or planned addition of overhead utility lines.
Such trees shall be small and medium trees that are pestand
disease-resistant and are slow growing.
[8] Trees for reforestation restitution/replacement shall be
indigenous to the Township.
[9] The Planning Board Engineer may approve the installation
of comparable substitution plant materials to satisfy the
requirements of the approved landscape plan when the
approved plants and landscape materials are not available
at the time that installations are to occur, or when other
unforeseen conditions prevent the use of the exact
materials shown on the approved landscape plan.
Significant changes that require the replacement and
relocation of more than 25% of the plant materials shall
require a new landscape plan and approval by the
Planning Board.
[10] Except for street yard trees, a mix of genus and species of
trees, shrubs, ground covering, perennials and annuals is
encouraged, but not required, in order to avoid potential

of two inches. The Manning Formula shall be utilized in the
sizing of stormwater drainage systems. A friction factor (n) of
zero and 0.012 shall be used for concrete pipe.
(e) In order to minimize the effect of stormwater runoff on
downstream drainage areas and facilities, each project will be
required to manage the excess runoff, including quality, in a
manner which adequately protects the downstream area.
Where water quality control is required to protect downstream
water supply sources or environmentally sensitive wetland
areas, a water quality detention basin shall provide for the
prolonged retention of runoff from a small design storm, either
a one-year-frequency Type II storm or a storm of 1 1/4 inches
of rainfall in a two-hour period. Provisions shall be made for
runoff to be retained and released so that 90% is released
within 18 hours. If this requirement results in a pipe smaller
than three inches in diameter, the period of retention shall be
waived so that three inches will be the minimum pipe size
used.
(f) Where control of post-development rates of runoff is required
to protect downstream properties or drainage facilities,
detention facilities shall be required to control the rate of
discharge for a one-hundred-year-frequency storm. The design
storm shall be computed either as a Type II, twenty-four-hour
storm in accordance with the United States Department of
Agriculture, Soil Conservation Service Technical Release No.
55, Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds, or as the estimated
maximum rainfall for the estimated time of concentration when
using the Rational Method.
(g) The Joint Planning Board shall consider reasonable
alternatives to the construction of detention basins for control
of stormwater quantity or quality. Measures, including but not
limited to tanks, infiltration, dry wells or sheet flow, through
vegetated areas may be used for this purpose.
(6) Landscaping.
(a) Landscaping design and planning shall be integrated into the
overall design and shall not be considered as an afterthought.
Proposed landscape design schemes shall be evaluated in their
relationship to the existing natural landscape or to the
developed or proposed landscape, including those on adjacent
properties. The existing natural landscape character shall be
preserved whenever possible and practicable.
(b) Landscaping shall be provided as part of the overall site plan,
designed and integrated into building arrangements,
topography, parking, setback and buffering requirements.
Landscaping shall include trees, bushes, shrubs, ground cover,
§ 142-234 JUNKYARDS § 142-234
138:563
perennials, plants and the use of building and paving materials
in an appropriate manner.
(c) The landscape shall be preserved in its natural state insofar as
practicable and, where desirable, by minimizing tree and soil
removal. Any grade changes shall be in keeping with the
general appearance of neighboring developed areas.
Treatment and design of proposed screening shall be shown
and shall be such as may be maintained throughout the year.
Areas of the lot not occupied by buildings, parking or walkways
shall be planted with grass, shrubs or other decorative
landscaping.
(d) A landscaping plan shall be submitted with each development
application. The plan shall identify existing and proposed trees,
shrubs, plant material, ground cover and natural features such
as boulders or rock outcroppings. It should show where they
are or will be located and the planting details. A tree-by-tree or
bush-by-bush inventory of existing conditions shall not be
required except for existing trees in excess of 12 inches caliper
in those areas disturbed by the development; however, an area
inventory showing existing site conditions and proposed
landscaping shall be required.
(e) One of the uses of landscaping will be to buffer and accentuate
boundaries and to involve the masking out or concealing of any
objectionable area. The achievement of this is left to the
designer. Buffering shall be employed to mask from the public
view or adjacent properties such service areas as trash and
garbage areas, outside equipment of an unaesthetic character
and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping
with the aesthetics of the project or neighborhood.
(f) Buffering, where required, shall be located around the
perimeter of the site to minimize headlights of vehicles, noise,
light from structures and the movement of people and vehicles
and to shield activities from adjacent properties. Buffering may
consist of fencing, evergreens, shrubs, deciduous trees or
combinations thereof to achieve the stated objectives.
(g) Buffers may consist of walls, fences, landscaping and berms
that shall be used to minimize any adverse impacts or
nuisances on the site or from adjacent areas. Buffer areas shall
be required for the following areas:
[1] Along property lines shielding various uses from one
another.
[2] Where interior roads or driveways run parallel with
roadways exterior to the site.
[3] Where parking areas abut other properties.
§ 142-234 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-234
138:564
[4] In the general areas of garbage storage areas, loading and
unloading areas and outdoor storage areas.
[5] As windbreak areas.
[6] To shield areas from deleterious noise or other adverse
conditions.
(h) Where evergreens are used as buffer materials, they shall be
planted in two staggered planted rows. The rows shall be four
to five feet apart, and the evergreens shall be planted eight
feet on center. Where earthen berms are utilized, they shall be
maintained with a minimum height of four feet, and a
maximum slope shall be suitably stabilized to prevent erosion.
(i) In parking lots, at least 5% of the parking areas shall be
landscaped. The landscaping should be located in protected
areas, along walkways, at center islands and at the end of bays.
In narrow islands, low spreading plants such as creeping
juniper, English ivy, myrtle or pachysandra are appropriate.
(j) All landscaping in parking areas shall be carefully located so as
not to obstruct vision. A variety of different types of trees
should be grouped to break up the mass of cars.
(k) For parking areas or lots, the paved parking surface shall
contain planting islands or planting beds as required in this
chapter. Such planting islands shall have a minimum
permeable surface of 50 square feet and shall be protected by
continuous concrete curbing or other permitted barriers.
Surface areas shall be planted or covered with organic
materials such as wood chips and may not be paved or covered
with stone, brick, concrete, slate or other like materials. Trees
having specifications approved by the Joint Planning Board
shall be planted within such islands at a ratio of one tree per
island. In lieu of planting islands, planting beds projected from
the perimeter shall be approved by the Joint Planning Board.
(l) Any person erecting a new building shall be required to plant
shade trees at intervals specified in this chapter along the
street line, either at the right-of-way line or on the side of the
sidewalk opposite from the curb or the place provided therefor.
Such trees shall not be less than 1 3/4 inches in diameter,
breast high, well branched and not less than 10 feet high with
branches starting not less than six feet from the crown of the
root system. The type of trees shall be designated by said Joint
Planning Board and shall be obtained from an accredited
nursery, with replacement guaranteed if such trees die within
two growing seasons.
(m) Foundation plantings shall be provided, with the exception of
single-family detached dwellings which will be left to the
§ 142-234 JUNKYARDS § 142-234
138:565
discretion of the applicant. All foundation plantings shall
consist of a continuous mulched landscape bed meandering
along the entire facade length, wherever primary unit
entrances occur. The landscape bed shall consist of an
appropriate mixture of deciduous evergreens and ornamental
trees, shrubs and ground covers.
O. Common recreation areas and open space owned in common.
(1) Common recreation areas and open space ownership. The
landowner or developer shall provide for and establish an
organization for the ownership and maintenance of any recreation
areas and/or open space which are owned in common by the
residents of any development, and such organization shall not be
dissolved nor shall it dispose of any such common areas by sale or
otherwise (except to an organization established to own and
maintain the common recreation areas and development open
space) without the written consent and approval of the governing
body of the Township of River Vale. Before dissolving and before
disposing of any recreation areas or open space owned in common,
the organization shall first be required to offer to dedicate those
common areas to the municipality, in accordance with the
provisions of N.J.S.A. 40:55D-43.
(2) Continuous maintenance of recreation areas owned in common and
open space owned in common. In the event that such organization
shall fail to maintain the common areas in reasonable order and
condition, the Township may require the owners or occupants of
multifamily units within multifamily developments to do so.
(3) Cost of maintenance. The cost of any maintenance performed by
the Township shall be assessed pro rata against the properties
within the development which own the common recreation area or
common open space, in accordance with values as assessed at the
time of imposition of the lien, which assessment shall be a lien and
tax on said properties to be added to and become a part of the taxes
to be levied and assessed thereon and enforced and collected with
interest by the same officers and in the same manner as other
taxes.
P. Fees. Fees shall be the same as those set forth for planned
developments as § 142-132 of this chapter.

HUD for use in New Jersey.
§ 142-235 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-235
138:568
F. For sale units:
(1) The initial price of a low- and moderate-income owner-occupied
single-family housing unit will be established so that after a down

H. A development fee ordinance was approved by COAH and adopted by
the Township of River Vale on October 28, 1993, as § 142-34 of this
chapter.
I. To provide assurances that low- and moderate-income units are created
with controls on affordability over time and that low- and moderateincome
households occupy these units, the Township of River Vale will
designate the Affordable Housing Management Service (AHMS) of the
New Jersey Department of Community Affairs with the responsibility of
ensuring the affordability of sales and rental units over time. The
Affordable Housing Management Service will be responsible for those
activities detailed in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1(a).
(1) In addition, the Affordable Housing Management Service will be
responsible for utilizing the verification and certification
procedures outlined in N.J.A.C. 5:93-9.1(b) in placing households in
low- and moderate-income units.
(2) Newly constructed low- and moderate-income sales units will
remain affordable to low- and moderate-income households for at
least 30 years. The Affordable Housing Management Service will
require all conveyances of newly constructed units to contain the
deed restriction and mortgage lien adopted by COAH and referred
to as Appendix E as found in N.J.A.C. 5:93.
(3) Housing units created through the conversion of a nonresidential
structure will be considered a new housing unit and will be subject
to thirty-year controls on affordability. The Affordable Housing
Management Service will require an appropriate deed restriction
and mortgage lien subject to COAH's approval.
J. Rehabilitated units (not applicable).
K. Regarding rental units:
(1) Newly constructed low- and moderate-income rental units will
remain affordable to low- and moderate-income households for at
§ 142-235 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-235
138:570
least 30 years. Affordable Housing Management Service will
require an appropriate deed restriction and mortgage lien subject
to COAH's approval.
(2) Affordability controls in accessory apartments will be for a period
of at least 10 years, except if the apartment is to receive a rental
bonus credit pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.13, then the controls on
affordability will extend for 30 years.
(3) Alternative living arrangements will be controlled in a manner
suitable to COAH, that provides assurances that such a facility will
house low- and moderate-income households for at least 10 years
except if the alternative living arrangement is to receive a rental
bonus credit pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-5.13, then the controls on
affordability will extend for 30 years.
L. Section 14(b) of the Fair Housing Act, N.J.S.A. 52:27D-301 et seq.,
incorporates the need to eliminate unnecessary cost-generating
features from River Vale's Land Use Ordinances. Accordingly, River
Vale will eliminate development standards that are not essential to
protect the public welfare, and, to expedite or fast-track municipal
approvals/denials on inclusionary development applications, River Vale
will adhere to the components of N.J.A.C. 5:93-10.1 through 5:93-10.3.
M. The Township of River Vale has a fair share obligation of 121 units of
which 121 is new construction. This ordinance will apply to all
developments that contain proposed low- and moderate-income units

138:577
ownership and occupancy and shall further comply with all
applicable HUD rules and regulations for self-certification of
compliance with the Act and with HUD's rules and regulations.
(d) COAH obligations. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, any development consisting of more than five units in
the T.H. Zone shall comply with the standards and procedures
set forth below relating to affordable housing requirements of
N.J.A.C. 5:94 and 5:95 and N.J.A.C. 5:80-26, which contain
COAH's Round 3 substantive and procedural rules, as amended
and/or revised ("COAH obligations"). All residential developers
in T.H. Zone building more than five units must meet the
requirements of the affordable housing obligation set forth
below. No division, site plan approval or building permit shall
be granted to a developer having an affordable housing
obligation pursuant to this section unless the developer
participates in the production of affordable housing pursuant
to this article.
[1] Minimum phasing schedule. Any developments consisting
of more than five units in the T.H. Zone shall contain a
minimum percentage of 20% of affordable housing units
on the property. By way of example, in the event a
developer was to construct a total of 59 housing units on
the property, 12 such housing units must be affordable
housing. All affordable housing units shall be distributed
throughout the T.H. Zone in a spatially even manner.
[2] Certificates of occupancy. Certificate of occupancy for the
remaining free-market units shall not be issued unless the
developer has obtained certificates of occupancy for the
affordable units in compliance with the above schedule.
[3] Cash contribution alternatives. No cash contribution
alternative will be accepted in lieu of construction of the
required affordable housing.
[4] Affordable Housing Official. The Township may appoint an
Affordable Housing Official who will be responsible for
monitoring and implementing the provisions of this article
and assuring that the affordable units remain affordable to
affordable households. No certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for an affordable unit without the written approval
of the Township or the Affordable Housing Official. Such
approval shall be denied unless the unit is subject to an
individual or master deed containing a covenant running
with the land which assures that the unit will remain
affordable to affordable households for a period of at least
the minimum required by COAH.
§ 142-236.1 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-236.1
138:578
[5] Sales, etc. No affordable unit shall be sold or resold,
rented or rerented without the written approval of the
Township or the Affordable Housing Official. In order to
obtain such approval, the seller or lessor shall be required
to demonstrate that the proposed sale or lease complies in
all respects with the provisions of this article and COAH
obligations.
[6] Pricing of units. Every development subject to the
requirements of this article shall contain a number of lowand
moderate-income units consistent with COAH
obligations. All units subject to the requirement of this
section shall be subject to price stratifications as set forth
in the COAH obligations. Pricing of units shall be stratified
to insure that there are a variety of sales prices or, as the
case may be, rental rates pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26, as
amended or revised.
[a] Rents or sale prices of units shall be established in
accordance with the uniform affordability controls set
forth in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.
[b] In establishing prices and rents, the uniform housing
affordability controls rely on the regional income
limits determined as follows:
[i] Median income by household size shall be
established by a regional weighted average of the
uncapped Section 8 income limits published by
HUD. To compute this regional income limit, the
HUD determination of median county income for
a family of four is multiplied by the estimated
households within the county. The resulting
product for each county within the housing region
is summed. The sum is divided by the estimated
total households in each housing region. This
quotient represents the regional weighted
average of median income for a household of four.
This regional weighted average is adjusted by
household size based on multipliers used by HUD
to adjust median income by household size.
[ii] The price and rent of low- and moderate-income
units may be increased annually based on the
percentage increase in the Housing Consumer
Price Index for the United States. This increase
shall not exceed 9% in any one year. Rents for
units constructed pursuant to low-income tax
credit regulations shall be indexed pursuant to
the regulations governing low-income tax credits.
§ 142-236.1 JUNKYARDS § 142-236.1
138:579
[7] Bedroom distribution. Every development subject to the
requirements of this article shall establish a distribution
for the number of bedrooms in the affordable units in
accordance with the uniform affordability controls set
forth in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26, as amended or revised.
[8] Affirmative marketing program. Every development
subject to the requirements of this article shall submit an
affirmative marketing program designed to disseminate
information regarding the availability of affordable income
units. The affirmative marketing process for available
affordable units shall begin at least four months prior to
expected occupancy. Advertising and outreach shall take
place during the first week of the marketing program and
each month thereafter until all available units have been
leased or sold. The program shall include at least the
following:

brochure(s), sign(s), and/or poster(s) currently used
as part of the affirmative marketing program:
[i] The county administrative building and/or the
county library for each county within the housing
region;
[ii] The municipal administrative building(s) and the
municipal library;
[iii] The developer's sales/rental office.
[g] The following is a current list of community and
regional organizations that will aid in soliciting lowand
moderate-income applicants:
[i] Religious groups.
[ii] Tenant organizations.
[iii] Civic organizations.
[h] The following is a description of the random selection
method that will be used to select occupants of lowand
moderate-income housing: Each applicant upon
submission of an application will be designated a
number. Two categories will be created: one for lowincome
households and one for moderate-income
households. A blind drawing will be undertaken: one
each for low- and moderate-income households who
are eligible for the specific affordable units.
[i] A waiting list of all eligible candidates will be
maintained in accordance with the provisions
contained in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26 et seq.

rental age-restricted low- and moderate-income housing in
conformance with the latest procedural and substantive rules of the
New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) and as part of a
comprehensive plan. The comprehensive plan will permit the affordable
housing development in conjunction with the subdivision of an
additional residential lot, which will facilitate the development of the
affordable housing. The rental age-restricted affordable housing
development will be located on the northern area of the property. The
residential lot to be subdivided will be located on the southern section
of the total tract. [Amended 9-24-2012 by Ord. No. 263-2012]
B. Permitted principal uses. Within the AH-1 Zone, the following uses are
permitted:
(1) Age-restricted multifamily affordable housing development: one/
more building(s) containing rental residential apartment units that
are affordable pursuant to the rules and regulations of the New
Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH). The building(s) shall
contain a one-bedroom apartment and office space for a Building
Supervisor. The Building Supervisor's apartment shall neither be
affordable nor age-restricted. Except for the Building Supervisor's
apartment, all units shall be affordable and age-restricted dwelling
units for households aged 62 and under as defined herein. Also
known as an "affordable housing development."

with the following exception:
(a) Any such sign located within the AH-1 is limited to 18 square
feet in area on each side and is mounted no greater than four
feet above finished grade on a freestanding wall or a structure
not exceeding six feet in height above the ground level. The
design, location and landscaping of such sign shall be as
approved by the Joint Planning Board.
(b) The sign shall only be externally illuminated, but illumination
shall not spill onto, or the light source be visible from, adjacent
dwellings.
D. Requirements for age-restricted multifamily affordable housing
development in the AH-1 Affordable Housing Zone.
(1) Use and occupancy restrictions:
(a) All units within the age-restricted multifamily affordable
housing development located in the AH-1 shall be agerestricted
units as defined in § 142-3 and affordable pursuant
to New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing (COAH) rules.
(b) Federal Fair Housing Act. The age-restricted multifamily
affordable housing development in the AH-1 Zone shall comply
with all applicable requirements of the Federal Fair Housing
Act and all amendments thereto, except as noted above, and all
applicable rules and regulations of the United States
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)
regarding such use, ownership and occupancy and shall
further comply with all applicable HUD rules and regulations
for self-certification of compliance with the Act and with HUD's
rules and regulations.
(c) Affordable Housing Official. The Township may appoint an
Affordable Housing Official who will be responsible for
monitoring and implementing the provisions of this section and
assuring that the affordable units remain affordable to
affordable households. No certificate of occupancy shall be
issued for an affordable unit without the written approval of
§ 142-236.2 JUNKYARDS § 142-236.2
138:591
the Township or the Affordable Housing Official. Such approval
shall be denied unless the unit is subject to an individual
or master deed containing a covenant running with the land
which assures that the unit will remain affordable to affordable
households for a period of at least the minimum required by
COAH.
(d) Rentals and sales.
[1] No affordable unit shall be rented or rerented without the
written approval of the Township or the Affordable
Housing Official. In order to obtain such approval, the
seller or lessor shall be required to demonstrate that the
proposed sale or lease complies in all respects with the
provisions of this article and COAH obligations.
[2] Rents or sale prices of affordable units shall be established
in accordance with the Uniform Affordability Controls set
forth in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.
[3] In establishing prices and rents, the Uniform Housing
Affordability Controls rely on the regional income limits
determined as follows:
[a] Median income by household size shall be established
by a regional weighted average of the uncapped
Section 8 income limits published by HUD. To
compute this regional income limit, the HUD
determination of median county income for a family of
four is multiplied by the estimated households within
the county. The resulting product for each county
within the housing region is summed. The sum is
divided by the estimated total households in each
housing region. This quotient represents the regional
weighted average of median income for a household of
four. This regional weighted average is adjusted by
household size based on multipliers used by HUD to
adjust median income by household size.
[b] The price and rent of low- and moderate-income units
may be increased annually based on the percentage
increase in the Housing Consumer Price Index for the
United States. This increase shall not exceed 9% in
any one year. Rents for units constructed pursuant to
low-income tax credit regulations shall be indexed
pursuant to the regulations governing low-income tax
credits.

A. Any sign which lawfully existed on the effective date of this article or an
amendment thereto which renders such sign nonconforming because it
does not conform to all of the standards and regulations of the adopted
or amended article shall be considered a legally nonconforming sign.
B. Any sign which was erected unlawfully prior to the adoption of this
article or amendment thereto, or which is erected hereafter in
contravention of the standards or regulations of this article without
obtaining the required permits or variances, shall be considered an
illegal nonconforming sign.
C. Loss of legally nonconforming status. A legally nonconforming sign
shall immediately lose its legal nonconforming status if:
(1) The sign is altered in any way in structure which tends to or makes
the sign less in compliance with the requirement of this Part 9 than
it was before the alteration.
(2) The sign structure is relocated to a position making it less in
compliance with the requirements of this Part 9, except that any
such sign which is hereafter required to be moved by a
governmental body for the purpose of construction, relocation,
widening or improvement of a street, highway or other public
purpose may be relocated once on the same lot and allowed to be
maintained and used as before. Such a sign, once relocated, is still
considered a legally nonconforming sign and bound by this section.
(3) The sign (except for copy on a changeable copy sign) is replaced.

extreme limits of the writing, representation, emblem, picture,
symbol, graphic illustration or other display, together with the sign
frame and any material or color forming an integral part of the
background of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the
backdrop or structure against which it is placed; or by delineating
the area established by reason of distinctive variation in
background color or by borders, whichever is greater.
(2) Computation of area of multifaced signs. The sign area for a sign
with more than one face shall be computed by adding together the
area of all sign faces visible from any one point. When two identical
sign faces are placed back to back, so that both faces cannot be
viewed from any point at the same time, and when such sign faces
are part of the same sign structure and are not more than 42 inches
apart at any point, the sign area shall be computed by the
measurement of one of the faces.
(3) Computation of height. The height of a sign shall be computed as
the distance from the base of the sign at grade to the top of the
highest attached component of the sign. Grade shall be construed
to be the newly established grade after construction.
B. Prohibited signs generally. No person shall construct, erect, locate, use
or maintain any of the following signs within any zone district of the
Township, except as otherwise permitted elsewhere in this Part 9, or
unless the sign has been certified to be a legal nonconforming sign by
the Construction Official or has obtained a variance for such sign:
(1) Any new sign erected in violation of any section of this Part 9. Any
sign not specifically permitted is hereby prohibited.
(2) Signs emitting a sound, odor or visible matter such as smoke or
vapor. No sign erected shall contain audio equipment.

(3) Exterior use of advertising devices such as banners, streamers,
pennants, flags, and balloons, lights (whether flashing, flickering,
blinking or rotating), wind-operated devices and any other type of
fluttering or flashing devices, or emitting an unsteady or glaring
light.
(4) Signs placed or affixed to vehicles and/or trailers which are parked
on a public right-of-way, public property or private property so as to
be visible from a public right-of-way where the apparent purpose is
to advertise a product or direct people to a business or activity
located on the same or nearby property. However, this is not in any
way intended to prohibit signs placed on or affixed to vehicles and
trailers, such as permanent lettering on motor vehicles, where the
sign is incidental to the primary use of the vehicle or trailer.
(5) Animated signs and mechanical contrivances. No sign erected shall
contain flashers, animators or mechanical movement or
contrivances of any kind, excepting clocks and time and weather
information.
(6) Paper posters and painted signs applied directly to a tree, rock or
natural feature of any kind or to a wall of a building, fence or pole
or other support.

provided for in this Part 9.

immediate threat to the public health, welfare and safety.

in excess of 30 days.

erected at the intersection of any streets in such a manner as to
obstruct free and clear vision, or at any location where, by reason
of the position, shape or color, it may interfere with, obstruct the

(1) Protect residential areas and land uses from potential adverse
impacts of towers and antennas;
(2) Encourage the location of towers in nonresidential areas;
(3) Minimize the total number of towers throughout the community;
(4) Strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as
a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use
towers;
(5) Encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the
extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the
community is minimal;
(6) Encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way
that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and
antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and
innovative camouflaging techniques;
(7) Enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services
to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively and
efficiently;
(8) Consider the public health and safety of communication towers;
and

COMMUNICATION TOWER  Includes any and all antennas and towers
as defined in this section, together with other accessory structures and
equipment associated therewith.
PREEXISTING TOWER AND PREEXISTING ANTENNA  Any tower or
antenna for which a building permit has been properly issued and the
structure has been completed. However, no such tower or antenna shall
be expanded, replaced, restored or repaired other than in compliance and
conformance with this article.
TOWER  Any structure that is designed and constructed primarily for
the purpose of supporting one or more antennas for telephone, radio and
similar communication purposes, including self-supporting lattice towers,
guyed towers or monopole towers. The term includes radio and television
transmission towers, microwave towers, common carrier towers, cellular
telephone towers, alternative tower structures and the like. The term shall
include the structure and any support thereof.
§ 142-281. Application and locations permitted.
A. Communications towers are and will be permitted on property owned,
controlled or leased by the Township of River Vale. Said leases shall be
created by the applicable statutory procedures in accordance with the
Local Public Contracts Law. Any other placement shall be considered a
conditional use if so zoned or a use variance anywhere else.
B. The Township of River Vale must consent to its property being used for
communications facilities. No communications tower shall be erected
or operated within the Township on its property except pursuant to an
approval, lease and license issued by the Township and entered into
between the operator of the facility and the Township.
C. Communications towers may be permitted as conditional uses in the
following building zones and districts, provided the criteria set forth in
§ 142-281D are complied with: Open Space and Recreation Zone,
Multifamily Affordable Housing (MFAH) and Conservation District
(CN). [Amended 6-22-2009 by Ord. No. 213-2009]
D. Municipal and conditional use communications towers must meet the
following criteria to be considered for approval:

§ 142-280.1 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-281
138:664
§ 142-282. Additional requirements and maintenance.
a residential property, recognized historic property, hospital or
health care facility, school or public recreation facility, except as
provided for below.
(2) At the discretion of the applicable Township board, the restrictions
on location may be relaxed if the applicant can demonstrate that
the entire facility would not be visible because it would be enclosed
within an existing structure such as a steeple.
A. All facilities shall be suitably secured. Decorative or visually
unobtrusive security fencing shall be required.
B. Site plan and escrows approved by the River Vale Joint Planning Board
shall be required.
C. In the event such communications towers are abandoned or not
operated for a period of one year, the same shall be considered
abandoned and removed, at the option of the Township, at the sole
expense of the operator.
D. Noise levels at any property line shall be not more than 50 decibels.
E. Site lighting shall be oriented inward to ward off side impact.
Necessary warning lights shall be in accordance with federal law and
regulations.
F. Any access to a communications facility shall conform to the driveway
provisions of the Township of River Vale Code.
G. Any generator located on the site shall be within a completely enclosed
soundproof equipment structure. All fuel shall be contained in
accordance with NJDEP requirements.
H. Site clearing shall be minimized to preclude the removal of vegetation
beyond that necessary to install and maintain the facility, as approved in
the site plan.
I. The maximum permissible height of a tower may be permitted up to 150
feet.
J. Owners are encouraged to paint, camouflage and/or obscure their
tower to resemble vegetation or trees, and such treatment may become
a condition of approval at the discretion of the applicable Township
board.
K. Towers should be freestanding monopole structures without significant
cross braces or other visible supporting devices. Lattice structure
towers shall not be permitted. Towers not obscured to resemble
vegetation or trees as is encouraged above shall be painted a color that
the applicant can demonstrate blends in obscurely with its background.
§ 142-281 JUNKYARDS § 142-282
138:665
L. No signs or other like devices shall be displayed or appended to the
facility or tower.
M. No offices or other commercial operations may be physically conducted
on site.
N. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of
the Federal Aviation Administration, the Federal Communications
Commission and any other agency of the state or federal government
with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards
and regulations are changed, then the owners of the towers and
antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas
into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six
months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a
direct compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling state or
federal agency. Failure to bring towers or antennas into compliance
with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds
for the removal of the tower or antenna at the owner's expense. To
ensure the structural integrity of towers, the owner of a tower shall
ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in
applicable federal, state or local building codes, and if, upon inspection,
the Township concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes
and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then
upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall
have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards.
Failure to bring such tower into compliance within said 30 days shall
constitute grounds for the removal of the tower or antenna at the
owner's expense or forfeiture of all rights, privileges and ownership of
the tower, antenna, facility or leased property and improvements.
O. Owners of existing towers must agree to share (rent) space on their
towers with other antenna users seeking to erect such a facility within
River Vale, irrespective of whether or not they are competitors. Such
users shall be subject to a co-user approval by the Joint Planning Board.
Reasonable fair-market lease agreements are required. The objectives
of this provision are to minimize the number of towers required within
the Township and avoid a proliferation of towers when multiple
antennas on one tower are possible.
P. At the discretion of the Joint Planning Board, visual screening
landscaping shall be required whenever the tower is not already
screened by adequate natural woodland vegetation.
Q. Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the Joint
Planning Board an inventory of all existing towers, antennas or sites
approved for towers or antennas that are either within the jurisdiction
of the governing authority and within a 1/4 mile of the border thereof,
including specific information about the location, height and design of
each tower. The Joint Planning Board may disseminate information
pursuant to the Right-to-Know Law or any other law or regulation
pertaining to the dissemination of public records to any organization
§ 142-282 RIVER VALE CODE § 142-282
138:666
seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing
authority; provided, however, that the Joint Planning Board is not by
disseminating such information in any way representing or warranting
that such sites are available or suitable.
R. Availability of suitable existing towers or other structures. No new
tower shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the
reasonable satisfaction of the governing authority that no existing
tower, structure or alternative technology that does not require the use
of towers or structures can accommodate the applicant's proposed
antenna. Evidence submitted to demonstrate that no existing tower or
structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna may
consist of any of the following:
(1) No existing towers or structures are located within the geographic
area required to meet applicant's engineering requirements.
(2) Existing towers or structures are not of sufficient height to meet
applicant's engineering requirements.
(3) Existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural
strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related
equipment.
(4) The applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic
interference with the antennas on the existing towers or structures
or the antennas on the existing towers or structures would cause
interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.
(5) The fees, costs or contractual provisions required by the owner in
order to share an existing tower or structure or to adapt an existing
tower or structure for sharing are unreasonable. Costs exceeding
new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.
(6) The applicant demonstrates that there are significant other limiting
factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.
(7) Applicant shall have the affirmative obligation of proving that it has
attempted to enter into a contact with the owners of the existing
tower and structure:
(a) This obligation shall include copies of all correspondence as to
rates, cost of contributions, etc.
(b) Copies of rejection of the offers propounded on the applicant
by the owners of the existing structure and/or tower.

to abate a nuisance or correct a violation where the owner or creditor,

on a vacant property or a property in foreclosure after notice and the
opportunity to abate or correct. In such situations, the Township may
impose a lien against the property for costs to correct the violation or abate
the nuisance. Such lien shall hereafter form part of the taxes next to be
assessed and levied upon said lands, the same to bear interest at the same
rate as such taxes to be collected and enforced by the same officers and in
the same manner as such taxes.
§ 180-12. Governmental entities exempt.
No governmental entity shall be required to register under this chapter.
However, nothing contained herein shall be construed as granting
exemption to the governmental entity from property maintenance or other
obligations imposed by any other statute, regulation, or ordinance.

within 10 days of the service of the foreclosure summons and complaint

A. Design and performance standards for stormwater management
measures.
(1) Stormwater management measures for major development shall be
developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality
standards in § 212-4. To the maximum extent practicable, these
standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone
are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater
management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be
incorporated into the design.

development.
groundwater recharge. The standards may apply to new
development, at the discretion of the Township of River Vale, to
the extent that alternative design and performance standards are
applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or water
quality management plan, which are not as strict as those herein,
adopted in accordance with Department rules.
A. The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the
stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a
major development in accordance with § 212-10.
B. Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of
concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as
documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural
Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:1B-15.147 through
13:1B-15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or
Clemmys muhlnebergi (bog turtle).
C. The following linear development projects are exempt from the
groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater
runoff quality requirements of § 212-4F and G:
(1) The construction of an underground utility line provided that the
disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion;
(2) The construction of an aboveground utility line, provided that the
existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent
practicable; and
(3) The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk
or trail with a maximum width of 14 feet, provided that the access
is made of permeable material.
D. A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge,
stormwater runoff quantity and stormwater runoff quality requirements
of § 212-4F and G may be obtained for the enlargement of an existing
public roadway or railroad or the construction or enlargement of a
public pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are
met:
(1) The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the
project that cannot be accomplished by any other means;
(2) The applicant demonstrates, through an alternatives analysis, that
through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater
management strategies and measures, the option selected
complies with the requirements of § 212-4F and G to the maximum
extent practicable;
§ 212-3 RIVER VALE CODE § 212-4
210:782
(3) The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements
of § 212-4F and G, existing structures currently in use, such as
homes and buildings, would need to be condemned; and
(4) The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other
rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through
condemnation lands not falling under Subsection D(3) above within
the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would
provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of
§ 212-4F and G that were not achievable onsite.
E. Nonstructural stormwater management strategies.
(1) To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in § 212-4F and
G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater
management strategies set forth at this § 212-4E into the design.
The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures
incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant
contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental or
safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater
management measures identified in Subsection E(2) below into the
design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the
strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention.
(2) Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated
into site design shall:
(a) Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas
particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss;
(b) Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the
flow of runoff over impervious surfaces;
(c) Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and
vegetation;
(d) Minimize the decrease in the time of concentration from

discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;
§ 212-4 SOLID WASTE § 212-4
210:783
(i) Provide other source controls to prevent or minimize the use or
exposure of pollutants at the site in order to prevent or
minimize the release of those pollutants into stormwater
runoff. Such source controls include, but are not limited to:
[1] Site design features that help to prevent accumulation of
trash and debris in drainage systems, including features
that satisfy § 212-4E(3) below;

and debris from drainage systems;
[3] Site design features that help to prevent and/or contain
spills or other harmful accumulations of pollutants at
industrial or commercial developments; and
[4] When establishing vegetation after land disturbance,
applying fertilizer in accordance with the requirements
established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control
Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and implementing rules.
(3) Site design features identified under § 212-4E(2)(i)[2] above shall
comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and
floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this
subsection, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris,
trash and other floating, suspended or settleable solids. For
exemptions to this standard, see § 212-4E(3)(c) below.
(a) Design engineers shall use either of the following grates
whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground
surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm
drain or surface water body under that grate:
[1] The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT)
bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the
NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways
Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or
[2] A different grate, if each individual clear space in that
grate has an area of no more than seven square inches or
is no greater than 0.5 inches across the smallest
dimension.
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates
in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening
portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer
manholes, ditch grates, trench grates and grates of
spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground
surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges),
driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks,
lawns, fields, open channels and stormwater basin floors.
§ 212-4 RIVER VALE CODE § 212-4
210:784
(b) Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear
space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if
the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an
area of no more than seven square inches or be no greater than
two inches across the smallest dimension.
(c) This standard does not apply:
[1] Where the review agency determines that this standard
would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could
not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger
storm drain inlets that meet these standards;
[2] Where flows from the water quality design storm as
specified in § 212-4G(1) are conveyed through any device
(e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment
device or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a
minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable
materials that could not pass through one of the following:
[a] A rectangular space four and five-eighths inches long
and one and one-half inches wide (this option does not
apply for outfall netting facilities); or
[b] A bar screen having a bar spacing of 0.5 inches.
[3] Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to
the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified
in § 212-4G(1); or
[4] Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey
Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that
action to meet this standard is an undertaking that
constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the
New Jersey Register listed historic property.
(4) Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management
measure to meet the performance standards in § 212-4F and G
shall be dedicated to a government agency, subject to a
conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's
office or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures
that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure
approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity, and
sufficient performance guarantees are provided for their
maintenance.
(5) Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is
available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual and as amended. The BMP Manual may be
obtained from the address identified in § 212-7, or found on the

F. Erosion control, groundwater recharge and runoff quantity standards.
(1) This subsection contains minimum design and performance
standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and
groundwater recharge and control stormwater runoff quantity
impacts of major development.
(a) The minimum design and performance standards for erosion
control are those established under the Soil Erosion and
Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., and
implementing rules.
(b) The minimum design and performance standards for
groundwater recharge are as follows:
[1] The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and
factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge
calculations at § 212-5, either:
[a] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the site and its stormwater management
measures maintain 100 percent of the average annual
preconstruction groundwater recharge volume for the
site; or
[b] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic
analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume
from preconstruction to postconstruction for the twoyear
storm is infiltrated.
[2] This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to
projects within the urban redevelopment area, or to
projects subject to Subsection F(1)(b)[3] below.
[3] The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged:
[a] Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High
pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and
commercial developments where solvents and/or
petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored or
applied; areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded
or stored; areas where hazardous materials are
expected to be present in greater than "reportable
quantities" as defined by the United States
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR
302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent
with Department-approved remedial action work plan
or landfill closure plan; and areas with high risks for
§ 212-4 RIVER VALE CODE § 212-4
210:786
spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and
vehicle maintenance facilities; and
[b] Industrial stormwater exposed to source material.
"Source material" means any material(s) or
machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is
directly or indirectly related to process,
manufacturing or other industrial activities, which
could be a source of pollutants in any industrial
stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source
materials include, but are not limited to, raw
materials; intermediate products; final products;
waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery
and fuels; and lubricants, solvents and detergents that
are related to process, manufacturing or other
industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater.
[4] The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on
the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid
adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic
impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a
naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause
surficial ponding, flooding of basements or interference
with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal
systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or
downgradient of the groundwater recharge area.
(c) In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts, the
design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for
stormwater runoff calculations at § 212-5, complete one of the
following:
[1] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that for stormwater leaving the site, postconstruction
runoff hydrographs for the two-, ten- and one-hundredyear
storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the
preconstruction runoff hydrographs for the same storm
events;
[2] Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis
that there is no increase, as compared to the
preconstruction condition, in the peak runoff rates of
stormwater leaving the site for the two-, ten- and onehundred-
year storm events and that the increased volume
or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase
flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis
shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses
and projected land uses assuming full development under
existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage
area;
§ 212-4 SOLID WASTE § 212-4
210:787
[3] Design stormwater management measures so that the
postconstruction peak runoff rates for the two-, ten- and
one-hundred-year storm events are 50%, 75% and 80%,
respectively, of the preconstruction peak runoff rates. The
percentages apply only to the postconstruction
stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the
site on which the proposed development or project is to be
constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to
postconstruction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard
areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not
increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or
[4] In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity
analysis in accordance with Subsection F(1)(c)[1], [2] and
[3] above shall only be applied if the increased volume of
stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the
point of discharge.
(2) Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the
definition of major development at § 212-2 shall be submitted to the
appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in
accordance with the requirements of this section and any
applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater
runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this
section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally
associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale.
Such uses do not include the development of land for the
processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally
related products.
G. Stormwater runoff quality standards.
(1) Stormwater management measures shall be designed to reduce the
postconstruction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater
runoff by 80 percent of the anticipated load from the developed
site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater management
measures shall only be required for water quality control if an
additional 1/4 acre of impervious surface is being proposed on a
development site. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to
any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric
effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution
Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in
a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this
requirement. The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of
rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into
account the distribution of rain from the water quality design
storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of
runoff may take into account the implementation of nonstructural
and structural stormwater management measures.

(2) For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents
the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in
accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management
Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the
address identified in § 212-7, or found on the Department's website
at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of
technical guidance are listed in § 212-7. TSS reduction shall be
calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2
below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating
removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides
documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative
rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved
alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be
provided to the Department at the following address: Division of
Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection, PO Box 418, Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418.
(3) If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required
eighty-percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize
the following formula to calculate TSS reduction:
R = A + B - (AXB)/100
Where
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both
BMPs, and
§ 212-4 SOLID WASTE § 212-4
210:789
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first
BMP
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to second BMP
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs
Best Management Practice TSS Percent Removal Rate
Bioretention systems 90%
Constructed stormwater
wetland
90%
Extended detention basin 40% to 60%
Infiltration structure 80%
Manufactured treatment device See § 212-6C
Sand filter 80%
Vegetative filter strip 60% to 80%
Wet pond 50% to 90%
(4) If there is more than one on-site drainage area, the eighty-percent
TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the
runoff from the subareas converge on site, in which case the
removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a
weighted average.
(5) Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to
reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the postconstruction
nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in
stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm.
In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible,
the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and
structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still
achieving the performance standards in § 212-4F and G.
(6) Additional information and examples are contained in the New
Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may

§ 212-4 RIVER VALE CODE § 212-4
210:790
fisheries significance of those established Category One waters.
These areas shall be designated and protected as follows:
(a) The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water
resource protection area in accordance with one of the
following:
[1] A three hundred-foot special water resource protection
area shall be provided on each side of the waterway,
measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of
the bank outwards or from the center line of the waterway,
where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing
vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural
succession is provided.
[2] Encroachment within the designated special water
resource protection area under Subsection G(8)(a)[1]
above shall only be allowed where previous development
or disturbance has occurred (for example, active
agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area).
The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant
demonstrates that the functional value and overall
condition of the special water resource protection area will
be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no
case shall the remaining special water resource protection
area be reduced to less than 150 feet as measured
perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or center
line of the waterway, where the bank is undefined. All
encroachments proposed under this subsection shall be
subject to review and approval by the Department.

(d) A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a
regional stormwater management planning committee as an
element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a
municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater
management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a
waterway subject to § 212-4G(8) has been approved by the
Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions
of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource
protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream
corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Subsection
G(8) shall maintain or enhance the current functional value
and overall condition of the special water resource protection
area as defined in Subsection G(8)(a)[1] above. In no case shall
a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the
Special Water Resource Protection Area to less than 150 feet
as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this
subsection.
(e) Subsection G(8) does not apply to the construction of one
individual single-family dwelling that is not part of a larger
development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision
approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the
construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.
A. Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following:
(1) The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the
following methods:
§ 212-4 RIVER VALE CODE § 212-5
210:792
(a) The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS)
methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and
Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS
National Engineering Handbook Section 4 - Hydrology and
Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds;
or
(b) The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational
Method for hydrograph computations.
(2) For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater
recharge, there is a presumption that the preconstruction condition
of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good
hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both
the NRCS methodology at § 212-5A(1)(a) and the Rational and
Modified Rational Methods at § 212-5A(1)(b). A runoff coefficient or
a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may
be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies
that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of
the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time
of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site
during the five years immediately prior to the time of application,
the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the
computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is
in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn
or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods) or with
good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land
use type is cultivation).
(3) In computing preconstruction stormwater runoff, the design
engineer shall account for all significant land features and
structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows or
culverts, that may reduce preconstruction stormwater runoff rates
and volumes.
(4) In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design
engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or
volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to
accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff
from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious
cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the
NRCS Technical Release 55 - Urban Hydrology for Small
Watersheds and other methods may be employed.
(5) If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management
measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined
at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the
effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater
management measures.
§ 212-5 SOLID WASTE § 212-5

take into account the existing site conditions, including, for
example, environmentally critical areas; wetlands; flood-prone
areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type,
permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and
the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone).
(2) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to
minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs and
ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the
intake to the outlet structure, as appropriate, and shall have
parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the
elevation of the water quality design storm. For elevations higher
than the water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet
structure shall be spaced no greater than 1/3 the width of the
diameter of the orifice or 1/3 the width of the weir, with a minimum
spacing between bars of one-inch and a maximum spacing between
bars of six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must
comply with the requirements of § 212-8D.
(3) Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed,
constructed and installed to be strong, durable and corrosionresistant.
Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions
of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3,
5:21-7.4, and 5:21-7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement.
(4) At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin,
the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in
diameter.

A. The Township Council hereby finds and declares that problems of traffic
control occur when traffic must be moved through or around road or
street construction, maintenance operations and utility work above or
below ground which requires blocking the roadway and obstructing the
normal flow of traffic; and that such obstructions are or can become
dangerous when not properly controlled. In order to better promote the
public health, safety, peace and welfare, it is necessary to establish
controls and regulations directed to the safe and expeditious movement
of traffic through construction and maintenance zones and to provide
safety for the workforces performing these operations.
B. The Township of River Vale in the County of Bergen, State of New
Jersey, does hereby adopt the current Manual on Uniform Traffic
Control Devices, hereafter known as "MUTCD" as may be
supplemented and amended, as it controls and regulates whenever
construction, maintenance operations or utility work obstructs the
normal flow of traffic. Any person, contractor or utility which fails to
comply with the provisions of MUTCD while performing such work is in
violation of this section.
A. It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor, or public utility
wishing to conduct work on, under or above the roadway to contact the
Traffic Bureau of the River Vale Police Department in order to arrange a
preconstruction meeting to submit plans for the safe movement of
traffic during such period of construction or work. Any person,
contractor or utility who fails to comply with this section prior to the
start of such work or whose plans are not approved by the Traffic
Bureau of the River Vale Police Department is in violation of this
section. Public utilities conducting routine maintenance work need not
comply with the preconstruction meeting requirement. A valid road
opening permit from the Township (see §§ 214-7 to 214-9) or Bergen
County shall be provided at the preconstruction meeting. Proof of utility

reasonable discretion, that the construction or maintenance operations
prior to 9:00 a.m. or after 4:00 p.m. on any roadway would substantially
delay traffic or cause a safety or health hazard, the work shall then be
permitted only between 9:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m.
A. The use or assignment of police officers by utility companies, private
contractors and other vendors for traffic control details shall be
compensated at the officer's overtime rate, with an additional

advance the amount of the compensation to be paid to the off-duty
police officers.
D. Officers assigned to a traffic control or road construction detail for a
utility company, private contractor or other vendor shall receive a
minimum compensation of four hours. Details exceeding the originally
scheduled hours shall be compensated at a minimum of two-hour
increments until the completion of the detail.
E. All cancellations require a minimum two hours' notification prior to the
scheduled start time of the detail. Noncompliance with this cancellation
notice shall result in the officer receiving a minimum of four hours'
compensation.

operations or emergency utility work must be performed that will
obstruct, interfere or detour traffic on any roadway in the Township, the
person, contractor or utility performing such operation shall notify the
River Vale Police Department of such emergency operation. The person,
contractor or utility shall disclose the nature of the emergency, location
and hours of operation.

ARTICLE I
General Personnel Policy Statements
§ A251-1. Applicability of other laws and regulations.
It is the policy of the Township of River Vale to treat employees and
prospective employees in a manner consistent with all applicable
employment laws and regulations. The personnel policies and procedures of
the Township shall apply to all employees, volunteers, elected or appointed
officials and independent contractors. In the event there is a conflict
between these rules and any collective bargaining agreement, personnel
services contract, and federal or state law including the Attorney General's
guidelines with respect to Police Department personnel matters, the terms
and conditions of that contract or law shall prevail. In all other cases, these
policies and procedures shall prevail.
§ A251-2. Appointment and promotion dependent upon
appropriation for position.
All employees, officers and department heads shall be appointed and
promoted by the Mayor. No person shall be employed or promoted unless
there exists a position created by an ordinance adopted by the Township
Council as well as the necessary budget appropriation and Salary
Ordinance.
§ A251-3. Duties of Business Administrator.
The Business Administrator and all managerial/supervisory personnel are
authorized and responsible for personnel policies and procedures. The
Township Council has appointed the Business Administrator to implement
personnel practices. The Business Administrator shall also have access to
the Township Attorney for guidance in personnel matters.
§ A251-4. No-tolerance policy; open-door policy.
As a general principle, the Township has a no-tolerance policy towards
workplace wrongdoing. Township officials, employees and independent
contractors are to report anything perceived to be improper. The Township
believes strongly in an open-door policy and encourages employees to talk
with their supervisor, department head, Business Administrator or Mayor
concerning any problem.
§ A251-5. Intent of Manual; amendment and supplementation
without notice.
The Personnel Policies and Procedures Manual adopted by the Township
Council is intended to provide guidelines covering public service by
Township employees and is not a contract. This manual contains many, but
not necessarily all of the rules, regulations, and conditions of employment
for Township personnel. The provisions of this manual may be amended and
§ A251-1 PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES § A251-5
A251:867
supplemented from time to time without notice and at the sole discretion of
the Township.
§ A251-6. Employment-at-will doctrine.
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the employment practices of the
Township shall operate under the legal doctrine known as "employment
at will." Within federal and state law, and any applicable bargaining unit
agreement, the Township shall have the right to terminate an employee at
any time and for any reason, with or without notice, except the Township
shall comply with all federal and state legal requirements requiring notice
and an opportunity to be heard in the event of discipline or dismissal.

ARTICLE II
Policies Relating to Employee Rights and Obligations
§ A251-7. Antidiscrimination.
The Township is committed to the principle of equal employment
opportunity pursuant to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act as amended
by the Equal Opportunity Act of 1972. Under no circumstances will the
Township discriminate on the basis of sex, race, creed, color, religion,
national origin, ancestry, age, marital or political status, disability, or sexual
orientation. Decisions regarding the hiring, promotion, transfer, demotion
or termination are based solely on the qualifications and performance of
the employee or prospective employee. If any employee or prospective
employee feels they have been treated unfairly, they have the right to
address their concern with their supervisor, or if they prefer their
department head, Business Administrator or Mayor.
§ A251-8. Americans with Disabilities Act.
§ A251-9. Contagious or life-threatening illnesses.
A. In compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act and the New
Jersey Law Against Discrimination, the Township does not discriminate
based on disability. The Township will endeavor to make every work
environment handicap assessable and all future construction and
renovation of facilities will be in accordance with applicable barrierfree
federal and state regulations and the Americans with Disabilities
Act Accessibility Guidelines.
B. The Business Administrator shall initiate an interactive dialogue with
disabled employees and prospective employees to identify reasonable
accommodations that do not create a hardship. Accommodations
include modifications to facilities, equipment and work procedures,
auxiliary aides, services and permanent reassignment to vacant
positions. Employees who are reassigned to a different position shall
receive the salary of their new position. Accommodations shall not be
unduly expensive, extensive and disruptive or fundamentally alter the
nature of the operation. The Act does not require the Township to offer
permanent light duty, relocate essential functions or provide personal
use items such as eyeglasses, hearing aids, wheelchairs, etc. To be
eligible for accommodations, individuals must (1) be able to perform the
essential function of the position, (2) not create a real safety hazard to
themselves, co-employees or the public, and (3) be otherwise qualified
for the position in that they possess the prerequisites including
education, experience, training, skills, licenses or certificates and other
job-related requirements. All decisions with respect to accommodations
shall be made by the Mayor.
A. The Township encourages employees with contagious diseases or lifethreatening
illnesses such as cancer, heart disease, Hepatitis C and
§ A251-7 PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES § A251-9
A251:869
§ A251-10. Safety.
The Township will provide a safe and healthy work environment and shall
comply with the Public Employees Occupational Safety and Health Act
(PEOSHA). The Township is equally concerned about the safety of the
public. Consistent with this policy, employees will receive periodic safety
training and will be provided with appropriate safety equipment. Employees
are responsible for observing safety rules and using available safety devices
including personal protective equipment. Failure to do so constitutes
grounds for disciplinary action. Any occupational or public unsafe condition,
practice, procedure or act must be immediately reported to the supervisor
or department head. Any on-the-job accident or accident involving Township
facilities, equipment or motor vehicles must also be immediately reported.
§ A251-11. Transitional duty.
HIV/AIDS to continue their normal pursuits, including work, to the
extent allowed by their condition. As in the case of other disabilities, the
Township shall make reasonable accommodations in accordance with
legal requirements to allow qualified employees with contagious or lifethreatening
illnesses to perform the essential functions of their jobs as
long as they are able to meet acceptable performance standards.
B. Medical information shall be treated confidentially. The Township will
take reasonable precautions to protect such information from
inappropriate disclosure. Managers and other employees have a
responsibility to maintain the confidentially of employee medical
information. Anyone inappropriately disclosing such information shall
be subject to disciplinary action.
C. Employees with questions or concerns about contagious or lifethreatening
illnesses are encouraged to contact the Business
Administrator.
A. The Township will endeavor to bring employees with temporary
disabilities back on the job as soon as possible and may assign
transitional duty to employees who temporarily cannot perform the
essential functions of their positions because of injury or illness.
Transitional duty is not guaranteed and will not exceed 45 workdays. If
a department already has one employee on transitional duty, it is
unlikely that another employee from that department will be assigned
transitional duty.
B. An employee requesting transitional duty or the workers' compensation
physician shall notify the Business Administrator as soon as the
temporarily disabled employee is able to return to work with
restrictions. Transitional duty will only be assigned if the employee will
probably be able to perform the essential functions of the position after
the transitional duty period. The Business Administrator will consult
with the department head to determine if there is any meaningful work
that can be performed consistent with the restrictions. Transitional

A251:870
§ A251-12. Drugs and alcohol.
§ A251-13. Workplace violence.
duty assignments may be in any department and not just the employee's
normal department. The Business Administrator will decide if it is in
the best interest of the Township to approve a transitional duty request
and will notify the employee of the decision. The Township reserves the
right to terminate the transitional duty assignment at any time without
cause.
C. Employees may not refuse transitional duty assignments that are
recommended by the workers' compensation physician. In such cases,
failure to report to work as directed shall constitute immediate grounds
for dismissal. If the employee believes that the transitional duty
assignment is beyond the employee's abilities, the employee may
request a meeting with the Business Administrator who will render a
written response within 24 hours.
D. Employees on transitional duty will receive their regular salaries and
are prohibited from engaging in any outside employment of any kind
unless they receive prior written approval from the Business
Administrator. If transitional duty is approved, the employee or
workers' compensation physician must keep the Business Administrator
informed of the medical progress. If at the end of transitional duty
period the employee is not able to return to work without restrictions,
the Township reserves the right at its sole discretion to extend the
transitional duty or place the employee back on workers' compensation
or disability. This policy does not affect an employee's rights under the
Americans with Disabilities Act, the Family and Medical Leave Act, the
Fair Labor Standards Act, the contagious or life threatening illnesses
policy88 or other federal or state law.
A. The Township recognizes that the use of unlawful drugs and the abuse
of alcohol pose a threat to the health and safety of all employees. Any
employee who is intoxicated or under the influence of alcohol or drugs
during working hours shall be immediately suspended and subject to
termination. The supervisor or department head will immediately
report any suspensions to the Business Administrator.
B. Employees using prescription drugs that may affect job performance or
safety must notify their supervisor or department head who is required
to maintain the confidentiality of any information regarding an
employee's medical condition. Township personnel who hold a
commercial driver's license (CDL) are subject to the provisions of the
commercial driver's licenses drug and alcohol testing policy.
A. The Township will not tolerate workplace violence. Violent acts or
threats made by an employee against another person or property are

The Township will not tolerate harassment in the work place including
harassment motivated by sex, race, creed, color, religion, national origin,
ancestry, age, nationality, marital or political status, disability or sexual
orientation. Township officials, appointees, managers, supervisors,
employees, volunteers and outside contractors alike must comply with this
policy and take appropriate measures to insure that such conduct does
not occur. Violations of this policy will result in disciplinary action up to
and including discharge or, in the event nonemployees are found to be at
fault, other appropriate action. Employees who feel they have been subject
to harassment must report the harassment to their supervisor or, if they
prefer, to the department head, Business Administrator or the Mayor. See
employee complaint policy (§ A251-17).
§ A251-15. Anti-sexual-harassment.

condition of employment;
§ A251-13 RIVER VALE CODE § A251-15
A251:872

(2) Making submission to or rejection of such conduct the basis for
employment decisions affecting the employee;
(3) Creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive working environment
by such conduct;
(4) Making unwelcome, offensive remarks or engaging in physical
contact with a subordinate or fellow employee that would not have
been made but for the employee's sex, or which is sexually oriented
to the extent that it would not occur but for the fact of the
employee's gender; or
(5) Harassment based solely on gender, which creates a hostile and
offensive work environment.
B. Sexual harassment may take different forms. One specific form is a
demand for sexual favors. Other forms of harassment include but are
not limited to:
(1) Sexual innuendoes, suggestive comments, jokes of a sexual nature,

report the harassment to their supervisor or, if they prefer, to the
department head, Business Administrator or Mayor. See employee
complaint policy (§ A251-17).
A. Employees have the right to complain of anything they perceive to be
improper. This right shall be communicated to all employees in a letter
outlining the specific employee complaint procedure. A written

included in the employee's official personnel file. This right will also be
communicated in the Employee Handbook. All complaints will be taken
seriously and promptly investigated.
B. The Township shall not take any retaliatory action or tolerate any
reprisal against an employee for any of the following:

Employees who wish to complain of harassment or any other workplace
wrongdoing are requested to immediately report the matter to their
supervisor or, if they prefer, to their department head, Business
Administrator or Mayor. Employees are encouraged to complain in writing
using the Employee Complaint Form, but may make a verbal complaint
at their discretion. No retaliatory measures shall be taken against any
employee who complains of workplace wrongdoing. The Township will,
to the maximum extent feasible, maintain the confidentiality of such
complaints on a need-to-know basis. However, investigation of such
complaints may require disclosure to the accused party and other witnesses
in order to gather pertinent facts.

policy or practice. The administration of whistle-blower complaints is
not subject to the limitations in the grievance policy (§ A251-18). In
accordance with the statute, a copy of this policy will be posted in all

The official personnel file for each employee shall be maintained by the
Business Administrator. Personnel files are confidential records that must
be secured in a locked cabinet and will only be available to authorized
managerial and supervisory personnel on a need-to-know basis. Records
relating to any medical condition will be maintained in a separate file.
Electronic personnel and medical records must be protected from

the Township. Grievances from union employees will be handled
pursuant to the terms of the applicable bargaining unit agreement.
All grievances from nonunion employees must be presented within five
working dates after arising, and failure to report a grievance within
such time shall be deemed as a waiver of the grievance. In the event
of a settlement or ruling that results in a determination of monetary
liability, such liability shall not exceed more than 30 working days prior
to the date the grievance was first presented in writing.
(1) Step One. Any employee or group of employees with a grievance
shall verbally communicate the grievance to the supervisor or
department head who will discuss the matter with the Business
Administrator. The supervisor or department head will
communicate the decision to the employee within two working
days.
(2) Step Two. If the employee is not satisfied with the decision, the

Township. Violations of this policy will result in appropriate discipline
including termination.

activities that are private in nature and unrelated to Township business.
However, business dealings that appear to create a conflict between the
employee and the Township's interests are unlawful under the New

stepchild, sibling, grandparents, daughter-in-law, son-in-law,
grandchildren, niece, nephew, uncle, aunt, or any person related by
blood or marriage residing in an employee's household. Employees are
required to disclose possible conflicts so that the Township may assess
and prevent potential conflicts. If there are any questions whether an
action or proposed course of conduct would create a conflict of interest,
immediately contact the Township Clerk or Business Administrator to
obtain clarification.

not interfere with their Township responsibilities. Employees are
prohibited from engaging in outside employment activities while on the

employees to restrict outside employment if the quality of Township
work diminishes. Any employees who holds an interest in, or is
employed by, any business doing business with the Township must
submit a written notice of these outside interests to the Business
Administrator.
E. Employees may not accept donations, gratuities, contributions or gifts
that could be interpreted to affect their Township duties. Under no
circumstances shall employees accept donations, gratuities,

do business with the Township or any person or firm seeking to
influence Township decisions. Meals and other entertainment valued in
excess of $150 are also prohibited. Employees are required to report to

organizations and participate in political activities, as long as they maintain
a clear separation between their official responsibilities and their political
affiliations. Employees are prohibited from engaging in political activities

for every employee to measure progress and to encourage self-improvement
at least twice a year. The evaluation will also record additional duties
performed, educational courses completed as well as a plan to correct any
weak points using the Employee Counseling Form. After completing the

the Business Administrator and submit written comments directly on the
evaluation form.

A. Employees are entitled to one day of sick leave for every month of
continuous service with the Township. Sick leave is to be used only in
cases where the employee is ill and unable to work, or in cases of the
serious illness of a family member. Employees absent on sick leave for
three or more consecutive working days must submit a doctor's
verification of illness or injury. If an employee is attending to an

months at the sole discretion of the Business Administrator if the leave
does not cause undue operational disruption. The leave must include
the use of any accrued vacation and sick leave time, regardless of the
length of leave requested. The portion of the leave that runs beyond the

medical leave for up to 12 weeks to care for a newly born or adopted
child or a seriously ill immediate family member or for the employee's
own serious health condition that makes the employee unable to
perform the functions of the employee's position. Eligible employees
who take leave under this policy must use all accrued available
vacation, sick, compensatory time and personal days during the leave.
The use of accrued time will not extend the leave period. After
exhausting accrued time, the employee will no longer be paid for the
remainder of the leave.

the Township within 60 days following release from active duty under
honorable circumstances.

180 days plus an additional 30 days. After this period has expired,
employees may continue coverage for themselves or their dependents
under the Township group plan by taking advantage of the COBRA
provision. Members of the state-administered retirement systems
(PERS and PFRS) will continue accruing service and salary credit in the
system during the one-hundred-and-eighty-day period.

request six months' advance notice to process the application. After giving
notice of retirement, employees are expected to assist their supervisor and
co-employees by providing information concerning their current projects
and help in the training of a replacement. The department head will prepare
an Employee Action Form showing any pay or other money owed the
employee. The Business Administrator will conduct a confidential exit
interview to discuss benefits including COBRA options, appropriate
retirement issues and pay due. A COBRA notification letter will be sent
to the employee's home address. The exit interview will also include an
open discussion with the employee. On the last day of work, and prior

periodic physical examinations to determine the employee's continued
ability to perform the duties of the position. All physical examinations

Except where state requirements direct otherwise, new employees or
present employees transferring to new positions will be hired subject to an
initial employment period of not less than three months or more than 12
months, as determined by the Business Administrator or Mayor. During this
initial employment period, the new employee or transferee will be provided
with training and guidance from the supervisor. At the end of the initial
employment period, the supervisor will conduct an employee evaluation.
See performance evaluation procedure (§ A251-62). New employees may
be discharged at any time during this period if the Business Administrator

Under appropriate circumstances, the Business Administrator may extend
the initial employment period.

employees as well as for major bargaining groups if appropriate and
required. Once approved, copies will be distributed and employees will
be required to sign an acknowledgement of receipt that will be placed in
the official personnel file. The Handbook will be revised and redistributed
whenever there is a significant change in personnel practice or every two
years.
§ A251-62. Performance evaluation.
A. Periodic evaluations are critical to create a formal record of an
employee's performance over time and establish a foundation for
personnel actions such as promotion and termination. In addition to
day-to-day feedback to the employee, a performance evaluation must be
conducted for all employees at least twice a year. The completed
appraisal becomes part of an employee's permanent record. This is a
legal document that is discoverable in lawsuits.
B. Performance discussions must also provide employees with guidance
regarding their ability to meet job standards. Extraordinary skills or
abilities should be recognized in addition to areas for improvement.
Supervisors or department heads should review future training needs
and career planning. The reviewer should also encourage the employee
to make suggestions about how the department can improve. The
reviewer should ask employees for feedback regarding the employee's
skills as they relate to communication, team building, delegation, and
sensitivity to needs of subordinates. Open communication is the key to
improvement.
(1) Setting the stage. The reviewer must create a productive climate
for the discussion. In preparing the evaluation form, prior
evaluations should be reviewed to identify trends. Employees must
be notified in advance of the meeting and should be given a copy of
the blank evaluation form. The meeting should be private without
interruptions in a comfortable environment.
(2) Confirm expectations. The reviewer should start the discussion of
each performance area by reviewing expectations. Ask the
employee to confirm the employee's understanding of job
requirements. Refer to the job description as appropriate.
(3) Continue the discussion by giving the employee's rating in each
performance area. The supervisor should be prepared to refer to
documentation. Employees should be evaluated based on set
standards, not as they compare to other employees. It is rare that
any person's rating in all areas is either high or low. The evaluation
should consider performance during the entire period, not just the
recent past. Care should be taken to avoid allowing one aspect of a
person's performance to overshadow all other performance factors
be it positive or negative. Ideally, each performance area should be
evaluated individually based on specific behaviors exhibited.
§ A251-61 RIVER VALE CODE § A251-62
A251:896
§ A251-63. Disciplinary action.
(a) "Outstanding" means exceptional performance in all areas of
responsibility. Planned objectives were achieved well above the
established standards and accomplishments were made in
unexpected areas.
(b) "Exceeds expectations" means consistently exceeds
established standards in most areas of responsibility. All
requirements must be met and objectives achieved above the
established standards.
(c) "Meets job requirements" means all job requirements were
met and planned objectives accomplished within established
standards. There were no critical areas where
accomplishments were less than planned.
(d) "Needs improvement" means performance in one or more
critical areas does not meet expectations. Not all planned
objectives were accomplished within the established standards
and some responsibilities were not completely met.
(e) "Does not meet minimum standards" means performance is
unacceptable and important objectives have not been
accomplished. Needs immediate improvement.
(4) Discussing future plans. This is where the reviewer should turn to
the discussion to the future performance and development of the
employee. A Counseling Action Plan Form must be completed if any
item is rated "needs improvement" or "does not meet minimum
standards." Specific performance goals must be established for the
next review period along with plans for achieving those goals.
(5) Closing the discussion. When all performance areas have been
discussed, close the discussion by summarizing all of ratings in an
overall rating for the review period.
C. After completing the evaluation, the reviewer will return the form(s)
with the signed acknowledgement to the Business Administrator. After
review by the Business Administrator, the form(s) are to be included in
the employee's official personnel file. As a part of the evaluation,
employees have the right to request a conference with the Business
Administrator.
A. All employees are expected to meet the Township's work performance
standards. The intent of the disciplinary action procedure is to formally
document problems and provide the employee with a reasonable time
to improve performance. The process should encourage development
by providing employees with guidance in areas that need improvement
such as poor work performance, attendance problems, personal
conduct, general compliance with the Township's policies and
procedures and other disciplinary problems.
§ A251-62 PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES § A251-63
A251:897
§ A251-64. Personnel file.
B. Should a supervisor believe that an employee is not conforming to the
Township's policies and rules or to specific instructions, or has acted
improperly, the supervisor will first privately discuss the matter with
the employee to obtain the employee's view. If the supervisor
determines that the employee has acted improperly, the supervisor
shall take one of the following actions depending upon the gravity and
the employee's past record:
(1) Verbal reprimand. Depending on the circumstances, the supervisor
may verbally notify the employee that the employee's actions have
been improper and warn the employee against further occurrences.
The supervisor will prepare a record of the verbal reprimand
including the date, time and what was discussed with the
employee. This record must be forwarded to the Business
Administrator for the employee's official personnel file.
(2) Business Administrator review. Should the supervisor consider the
offense sufficiently serious to warrant consideration by the
Business Administrator, the employee will be so advised and a
meeting arranged with the Business Administrator at the earliest
possible date. All facts should be detailed at this meeting and, if
possible, a determination will be made at that time of disciplinary
action, if any.
(3) Written reprimand. When a supervisor determines that a written
reprimand is appropriate, the situation must be discussed with the
Business Administrator. The reprimand should clearly identify the
problem and outline a course of corrective action within a specific
time frame. The employee should clearly understand both the
corrective action and the consequence (i.e., termination) if the
problem is not corrected or reoccurs. The employee should
acknowledge receipt of the warning and may include additional
comments. A copy of the written reprimand with the signed
acknowledgement and comments must be forwarded to the
Business Administrator for the employee's official personnel file.
(4) Whenever an employee is recommended for suspension, the
Business Administrator will make the decision and may seek the
advice of the Township Counsel if appropriate. Suspended
employees may request a hearing under the applicable grievance
procedure.
(5) Whenever an employee is recommended for dismissal, the Business
Administrator will make the decision only after seeking the advice
of the Township Counsel. There must be a complete review of the
employee's personnel file and all other facts to determine if there is
sufficient cause for the dismissal. Terminated employees may
request a hearing under the applicable grievance procedure.
§ A251-63 RIVER VALE CODE § A251-64
A251:898
§ A251-65. Employee complaint investigation.
Employees have the right to formally or informally report any statement,
act, or behavior by a co-employee, supervisor, intern, municipal appointee,
elected official or visitor that they believe to be improper.
A. The official personnel files shall be maintained by the Business
Administrator and employee medical information will be maintained in
a separate file. At least annually, the Business Administrator will review
files to make sure they are up to date and will follow up with the
department heads as necessary.
B. The official file shall include at least the following:
(1) The original application signed by the employee;
(2) Notes from any preemployment interview and reference check;
(3) The original letter detailing an offer of employment and any
additional correspondence concerning the employee's hiring;
(4) A signed acknowledgement that the employee received a copy of
the employee complaint policy letter;
(5) A signed acknowledgement that the employee has received the
Employee Handbook;
(6) A signed acknowledgement that the employee received the safety
orientation;
(7) Annual written performance evaluations including documentation
that the evaluation was reviewed with the employee;
(8) Counseling action plans;
(9) Records relating to on-the-job accidents;
(10) Disciplinary actions including an acknowledgement that the
employee was notified of the proposed disciplinary action and was
given an opportunity to respond;
(11) Records relating to any other employment actions including
promotions, demotions;
(12) Transfers, resignations, leaves, etc.;
(13) Educational transcripts; and
(14) Any other pertinent information.
A. Employees should be asked to report complaints in writing utilizing the
Employee Complaint Form, but are not compelled to do so.
B. Identification/screening. The supervisor or department head must
report all written or verbal complaints to the Business Administrator
§ A251-64 PERSONNEL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES § A251-65
A251:899
unless the complaint is against the Business Administrator. Upon
receipt, the Business Administrator will determine if the complaint was
made pursuant to the general anti-harassment policy, the anti-sexualharassment
policy, the whistle-blower policy, a grievance procedure
or is another form of complaint. A file will be established including
the written complaint, the investigation procedure followed and the
response action plan. As soon as possible but no later than 10 days after
receiving the complaint, the Business Administrator or investigator
appointed by the will interview the employee. If the employee is
reluctant to sign a written complaint, the Business Administrator will
prepare written notes of the date, time and place of the complaint
and the specific allegations. These notes will be read back to the
employee who will be asked to affirm, preferably in writing, as to the
information's accuracy.
C. The Business Administrator will seek the advice of the Township
Counsel when planning the investigation. The investigation should be
conducted by the Township Counsel or County Prosecutor if it involves
potential criminal charges. The investigation should establish the
frequency and nature of the alleged conduct and whether the complaint
coincides with other employment events such as a poor performance
evaluation. The investigation should also determine if other employees
were subjected to similar misconduct. It is important to protect the
rights of both the person making the complaint and the alleged
wrongdoer.
D. Response plan: no corrective action required. The Business
Administrator will discuss the conclusions with the Township Counsel
and render a decision within 14 days after the investigation is complete.
If the validity of a complaint cannot be determined or the complaint is
groundless, the complaining employee should be notified in writing.
Care should be taken to avoid being too specific, confrontational or
accusatory and to avoid any language that might be construed as
defamatory. A general statement is usually more appropriate that the
claim was thoroughly investigated, but could not be sufficiently
documented or confirmed to justify taking formal action. The employee
should be assured that future complaints will be investigated and that
the Township is committed to eliminating wrongful employment
practices when they are found to exist. If the investigation reveals that
the complainant intentionally and maliciously levied false charges
against the alleged wrongdoer, the complainant must be notified of the
seriousness of filing a false complaint, and the appropriate disciplinary
penalty under the circumstances, up to and including termination.
E. Response plan: corrective action required. If the investigation reveals
that the complaint is justified and substantiated, the Business
Administrator will formulate with the advise of the Township Counsel a
corrective action plan as well as possible disciplinary action. The
complaining employee will be notified, in writing that it appears that
the complaint was justified and an appropriate response plan has been
§ A251-65 RIVER VALE CODE § A251-65
A251:900
§ A251-66. Requests for employment verification and reference.
§ A251-67. Continuing education.
formulated. A copy of the response plan should be attached to the letter.
The response plan should provide for appropriate remedial action to
prevent a recurrence of the wrongful act or behavior.
A. Inquiries and written requests for references or employment
verification regarding a current or former employee must be referred to
the Business Administrator. No employee may issue a reference letter
without the permission of the Business Administrator. Under no
circumstances should any information be released over the phone.
B. In response to a request for information, the Business Administrator
will only verify an employee's name, dates of employment, job title,
department and final salary. No other data or information will be
furnished unless:
(1) The Township is required to release the information by law; or
(2) The employee or former employee authorizes the Township in
writing to furnish this information and releases the Township from
liability.
A. The Township, in conjunction with the Township Counsel, will arrange
for employment practices seminars at least annually to train all
managerial/supervisory personnel. The Township will also offer
nonmandatory training to all other employees with special emphasis on
employee rights and protections under various federal and state laws as
well as Township employment practices. Records will be maintained in
the official personnel files of all employees trained under this
procedure.
B. Managerial and supervisory personnel will also update employees
periodically by department meetings and memos that should address
specific problems and concerns that may arise. Every effort will be
made to encourage employee suggestions about ways to avoid
employer-employee disputes and violations of employment rights.
