   We, the people of Northwood, in the County of Wood and State of Ohio, in
order to secure the benefits of municipal home rule and to exercise all powers
of local self-government under the Constitution and laws of the State of Ohio,
do hereby adopt this Charter for the government of the Municipality of
Northwood.
ARTICLE I
NAME AND BOUNDARIES
   The municipal corporation now existing in the County of Wood, State of Ohio,
and known as the Village of Northwood, Ohio, hereinafter in this Charter called
the "Municipality", shall continue to be a body politic and corporate under the
name of Northwood, with the same boundaries as now exist, but with power and
authority to change the boundaries and annex other territory contiguous thereto
in the manner authorized by the laws of the State of Ohio. No territory shall
be detached therefrom, nor shall the Municipality be annexed to any other
municipality or body politic, nor shall the corporate existence of the
Municipality be terminated, without the consent of its Council and of a
majority of the electors of the Municipality voting on such proposal at an
election held and conducted in the manner provided by law.
ARTICLE II
MUNICIPAL POWERS
   The Municipality shall have all powers of local self-government now and
hereafter granted to municipalities by the Constitution of the State of Ohio
and such further powers as are now or hereafter may be granted by the laws of
the State of Ohio. All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed
in this Charter or, if not prescribed herein, in such lawful manner as the
Council shall determine by ordinance or resolution. Enumeration of or reference
to particular powers in this Charter shall not be construed to be exclusive.
ARTICLE III
THE COUNCIL

   The legislative power of the Municipality shall be vested in a Council which
shall be a continuing body consisting of seven (7) members at large.
   All existing elected Council members shall remain in office until the
termination of their respective terms of office.
   Four Council members shall be elected under this Charter at the regular
Municipal election to be held in the year 1981, and at subsequent regular
Municipal elections to succeed those whose terms will expire at the conclusion
of the year in which such election is held as hereinafter provided.
   Three Council members shall be elected under this Charter at the regular
Municipal election to be held in the year 1983 and at subsequent regular

   Council shall be the sole and final judge of the election and qualifications
of its members. Any member of Council who shall cease to possess or who

Failure of any member of Council to maintain said qualifications shall not
render void or ineffective any action of Council in which such member has
participated.

first term beginning January 1, 1982. For the terms thereafter the Council may

such person is serving. If the Council determines to change the established
salary of members in respect to a succeeding term of office, such change must
be made by the Council before the first day of July next preceding a regular
Municipal election. Unless and until the salary is so changed, it shall remain
as last fixed.

required by the provisions of this Charter (see Section 3.11 Paragraph A) or
the laws of the State of Ohio not in conflict therewith.
Sec. 3.06 Rules and Journal of Council

disapproval by the Mayor, as the case may be. Each emergency measure shall
contain a statement of the necessity for such emergency action and shall
require the affirmative vote of at least five (5) members of Council for its
enactment. No action of the Council authorizing any change in the boundaries of
the Municipality, or authorizing the surrender of joint exercise of its powers,

CHAPTER 204
Official Standards
EDITOR'S NOTE: The State of Ohio operates on Eastern Daylight Savings Time from
2:00 a.m. of the first Sunday in April until 2:00 a.m. of the last Sunday in
October. Congress, on March 22, 1966, passed the Uniform Time Act requiring
uniform observance throughout the nation of Daylight Savings Time starting in
1967, except that a State legislature could exempt the entire state from
Daylight Savings Time or divide a state into not more than two parts, each with
a different time standard. The Ohio legislature, through inaction, has elected
to observe Eastern Daylight Savings Time throughout the State.
On August 8, 2005, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 was enacted. This Act changed
the time change dates for Daylight Saving Time in the United States. Beginning
in 2007, the State of Ohio begins Daylight Saving Time at 2:00 a.m. on the
second Sunday in March and reverts to standard time at 2:00 a.m. on the first
Sunday in November. The Secretary of Energy will report the impact of this
change to Congress. Congress retains the right to resume the 2005 Daylight
Saving Time schedule once the Department of Energy study is complete.

in lieu thereof.
(Ord. 2003-1.  Passed 1-9-03; Ord. 2016-30.  Passed 11-10-16.)
220.02  RULES.
   (1)   President Pro Tempore and Clerk.
      A.   Members of Council shall, at the first meeting in January of each
year, elect a President Pro Tempore from its own number, who shall serve until
the next meeting in January next after his or her election.
      B.   The President Pro Tempore shall preside in the absence of the Mayor.
      C.   The Clerk of Council shall attend all meetings, regular and special,
record all proceedings in the minutes, prepare an agenda for every meeting,
attend to all correspondence incidental to his or her office, attend to the
codification of all ordinances, according to the system employed by the
Municipality, and perform such other duties as may be assigned to him or her by
a majority vote of Council.
      D.   The President Pro Tempore shall have full power to vote while
serving as Acting Mayor.
   (2)   Quorum. (See
Section 3.05  of the City Charter.)
   (3)   Rules: Expulsion of Members: Absence from Meetings.
      A.   Council shall determine its own rules and keep a record of its
proceedings. It may punish or expel any member for disorderly conduct in
Council or for a violation of its rules, and may declare his or her seat vacant
for absence without valid excuse, where such absence has continued for two
months. No expulsion shall take place without the concurrence of two-thirds of
all the members elected and until the delinquent member has been notified of
the charge against him and has had an opportunity to be heard.
      B.   The presiding officer may allow a motion from any member who
believes a member has violated a rule to declare the violation of the rule
sufficient to find the Council person absent without excuse for the remainder
of the meeting. Any member determined to be absent without excuse for a rule
violation may cure the violation and request Council to reconsider its
decision.
   (4)   Presiding Officer.
      A.   The Mayor shall be the Presiding Officer. The Presiding Officer
shall call the meeting to order at the appointed time, announce the business
before Council in its proper order and state and put all questions properly
brought before Council. He or she shall, in common with any other member, call
any member who violates any of the rules and shall, when in the chair, decide
all questions of order, subject to an appeal to Council, on demand of the
member, on which appeal there shall be no debate, but the member making appeal
may briefly state his or her reasons for the same.
      B.   The Presiding Officer should be careful to avoid any appearance of
political partisanship on any question. His or her function shall be to see
that the business properly brought before Council is conducted in an orderly
manner and that the members of Council observe the rules of procedure adopted
by Council.
   (5)   Schedule of Business for Conducting Council. The following schedule of
business shall govern the conduct of Council meetings:
      A.   Roll call. Roll call of members to determine if a quorum is present;
absent Council members shall be excused by motion, for cause.
      B.   Pledge of Allegiance.
      C.   Approval of minutes. Approval of minutes of the previous meeting and
correction of errors of omission or commission therein, if any.
      D.   Public comment. Re: legislation on current meeting agenda.
      E.   Reading of communications. Should any such communication call for
Council action which cannot be immediately taken, it shall be referred to the
appropriate' committee by the Presiding Officer. Should there be any question
about the committee to which any matter should be referred, Council may, by
majority vote, have the matter referred to any committee.
      F.   Committee reports.
         1.   In writing. Reports of committees should be in writing. Written
minority reports may also be presented, if desired.
         2.   Standing committees. Standing committees shall be as follows;
which are permanent in their functions, but may have a change in membership
from one Council to the next. Appointments shall be made as provided in Rule
(8) hereof.
            Economic Development Finance
            Recreation Board
            Safety
            Service
            Committee of the Whole
         3.   Contents of reports. All petitions, ordinances and resolutions
presented to Council may be referred to the proper committee for study and
report.
         4.   Legislation referred to committee. When ordinances and
resolutions are to be prepared, Council shall, by majority vote, request their
preparation by the Solicitor. When they are prepared, they may be referred to
the committee concerned with the subject matter of the ordinance or resolution.
The committee shall then report out the ordinance or resolution at the next
Council meeting. Council may accept or reject any committee report, in whole or
part. The Solicitor has the responsibility of preparing legislation in the
manner prescribed by law. The committee to which legislation is referred shall
not concern themselves with the fulfillment of legal requirements. They shall
only determine whether the subject matter has been fully covered.
         5.   The voting on such legislation shall be entered by the Clerk, in
writing, in the minutes as "aye" and "nay" or "abstain" together with the names
of members of Council voting "aye", "nay", and those voting "abstain".
(Abstentions may only be for cause, which cause shall be stated.)
         6.   Seconding of motions. Seconding of motions is required.
         7.   First reading of ordinances; resolutions. When committees report
out ordinances, these shall be set aside and given a first reading at the end
of committee reports. Thus, all ordinances shall be given a first reading at
one time. Resolutions, unless permanent in nature, may be voted upon
immediately or acted upon at the same time as the ordinances.
         8.   Second reading of ordinances; emergency ordinances. When an
ordinance is presented, it shall be read by the Clerk and, if it is not an
emergency ordinance, it shall be set aside for second reading at the next
meeting. If it is an emergency ordinance, requiring immediate action, the
Presiding Officer shall, after it is read by the Clerk, entertain a motion to
suspend the rules and read the ordinance by its title only for the second and
third readings. If three-fourths of the members approve the motion, the Clerk
shall then read the ordinance by its title only for the second and third
readings. The ordinance is now ready for passage. After a member moves for
passage, a vote shall be taken. If two-thirds of all the members elected
approve the passage of the ordinance, it shall be signed by the Clerk and sent
to the Mayor for his or her signature.
         9.   Clerk to enter vote in the minutes. The Clerk shall enter in the
minutes the vote on all ordinances and resolutions, together with the names of
those voting "aye" and those voting "nay".
         10.   New business. The Presiding Officer shall call for new business.
Ordinances and resolutions which require immediate action may be considered in
this category. This may occur where certain action cannot wait for the referral
and consideration by committee. Any other ordinance or resolution which, for
any reason, need not be referred to committee can be presented at this time.
         11.   Reference to committee. Any new business brought before Council
may be referred to the proper committee, if such referral is deemed necessary
or proper. If such referral is not needed, and the matter can be disposed of
quickly, then such action shall be taken at once. When communications are read
earlier in the meeting, they may, if necessary, be referred to committee
immediately after being read by the Clerk. If the matter under consideration
requires investigation and study, or is of such a nature that long discussion
may be provoked, it shall promptly be referred to committee by the Presiding
Officer.
         12.   Reference to Committee of the Whole. The Committee of the Whole
is a meeting of the entire Council, as a committee, but, instead of the usual
Presiding Officer being in charge, the Chairman of the Committee of the Whole
shall preside. Referral to this committee may take place when a major situation
or problem arises on which it is felt that every member of Council should
express himself and/or debate or discussion in the regular meeting will consume
too much time and interfere with the regular order of business. Committee of
the Whole shall sit as a committee, discuss the question as a group and receive
the views and opinions of all the members. The committee shall be governed by
the rules of Council in its deliberations.
            The committee shall report its recommendations or findings to
Council, upon the vote of a majority of the committee. This report shall be in
writing and shall be signed by those concurring in the committee action. If the
committee believes that further study or investigation is indicated, it may
recommend to Council that the matter be referred to a certain committee. If the
question deals with finances, it may recommend that the matter be turned over
to the Finance Committee. Any report of the Committee of the Whole shall be
voted upon, just as in the case of any other committee report.
      G.   Pending legislation.
      H.   New legislation.
      I.   Mayor's report.
      J.   City Administrator's report.
      K.   City Clerk's report.
      L.   Discussion with the City Attorney.
      M.   Discussion with the City Engineer.
      N.   New business.
      O.   Old business.
      P.   Public comment/persons appearing before Council.
      Q.   Executive session. (By motion of Council, if necessary.)
      R.   Adjournment.
   (6)   Discussion. No member shall be allowed to speak more than once upon
any subject until every member choosing to speak has had an opportunity to be
heard, nor more than twice upon any subject, nor for a time longer than five
minutes, without leave of Council. This rule shall apply equally to any public
official who attends Council, including the Mayor, the Clerk, the Solicitor and
others.
   (7)   Agenda. The Clerk shall prepare an agenda or schedule of matters to be
brought before Council. This agenda may be given to the members of Council just
before the meeting or, if possible, mailed to them before the meeting. Any
person, group or delegation wishing to appear before Council shall direct a
letter to the Clerk in such time that he or she will receive it before the time
of the Council meeting. The letter should clearly state the purpose of the
appearance and the approximate number who will appear in the group.
   Chairmen of committees which are to report at the next meeting shall get to
the Clerk a written copy of the report to be made. The Clerk shall also be
notified of ordinances and resolutions to be presented and any member of
Council who wishes to bring a matter before the body, other than a committee
report, shall likewise notify the Clerk of the nature of the matter.
   The order of business adopted by Council shall determine the order in which
matters will appear on the agenda.
   (8)   Appointments to Committees. All appointments of committees, except
such as are permitted by law to certain officials, shall be made by the Mayor,
subject to the approval of a majority of Council.
   (9)   Emergency Legislation. All legislation passed as emergency legislation
must state the reason for the emergency, not in mere general terms that such
action is "necessary for the peace, health, welfare and safety of the City" but
with specificity.
   (10)   Receiving Motion When Question Is Before Council. When a question or
a proposition is before Council or under debate, or when a motion has been
made, no motions shall be received except the following:
      A.   To adjourn;
      B.   To table the motion, i.e. lay it aside until later;
      C.   To request that discussion end and that any motion being considered
be voted on (usually called "motion for the previous question");
      D.   To postpone any action on a motion until some stated future time;
      E.   To refer the proposal to a standing or special committee;
      F.   To amend the main motion;
      G.   To postpone any action for an indefinite time. These motions shall
have precedence in the order in which they are arranged. Motions listed as
subparagraphs A., B. and C. hereof shall be decided without debate.
   (11)   Handling Motions for Reference to Committee. When a motion is made
for a reference of any subject to a standing committee, and it is moved to
substitute therefor a select or special committee, the question of reference to
a standing committee shall be put first.
   (12)   Motions to Reconsider. A motion to reconsider a subject that may have
been acted upon favorably must be made before adjournment of that session of
Council. A motion to reconsider any other subject may be made not later than
the next regular meeting after such action was taken. A motion to reconsider
may be made only by any member who voted with the winning or prevailing side. A
motion to reconsider shall be in order at any time except when a motion on some
other subject is standing.
   A motion to reconsider, being laid on the table, may be taken up and acted
upon at any time when Council is engaged in the transaction of new or
miscellaneous business.
   No motion to reconsider shall be made more than once on any matter or
subject, and the same number of votes shall be required to reconsider the
action of Council as was required to pass or adopt the same.
   (13)   Motion to Take From the Table. A motion to take from the table shall
be in order when that order of business is being transacted in which such
matter to be taken up was laid upon the table, or under the head of new or
miscellaneous business, and such motion shall be decided without debate,
provided that the mover may be permitted to state briefly his or her reasons
for the motion.
   (14)   Motion to Postpone Indefinitely. If a motion to postpone indefinitely
is carried, the principal question shall be declared lost.
   (15)   Motion for the Previous Question. The previous question shall be in
the form "Shall the main question now be put?" It shall be admitted only when
demanded by two members and, until decided, shall preclude further debate,
amendments and motions. If the previous question is demanded on an amendment,
it shall apply only to the amendment. If the motion for the previous question
is carried, the question shall be put without further debate. However, if the
motion for the previous question, though carried, is not yet actually executed,
the motion to which it is directed may be laid on the table.
   (16)   Motion to Amend. A motion to amend is susceptible of only one
amendment thereof. An amendment once rejected may not be moved again in the
same form.
   (17)   Motion on Question of Privilege. Questions of privilege shall be,
first; Those affecting the rights of Council collectively, its safety, dignity
and the integrity of its proceedings; second: The rights, reputation and
conduct of the members of Council individually, in their capacity as such
members. A question of privilege shall have precedence over all questions
except a motion to adjourn.
   (18)   Motion that Matter be Taken from Committee. When any ordinance,
resolution, petition or other matter has been referred to a committee, and such
committee fails, within a reasonable time, to report, or to offer a valid
reason for its failure to report, any member of Council shall have the right to
make a motion that such ordinance, resolution, petition or matter be taken from
such committee so that the same may be laid before Council for action. Such
motion shall be decided without debate, provided that the member making the
motion may briefly state his or her reasons for the motion.
   (19)   Majority Defined; Three-Fourths Defined. Whenever the term "majority"
is used in these rules, unless otherwise expressly indicated, it shall mean a
majority of those
elected to Council; likewise, whenever a two-thirds or three-fourths vote is
indicated, it shall mean two-thirds or three-fourths of the members elected to
Council.
   (20)   Ordinance or Resolution Granting Franchise, Creating Right etc.,
Rules Governing. (See Section
3.11  of the City Charter.)
   (21)   Suspension of Rules Relating to Reading By-Laws, Resolutions and
Ordinances. (See Section
3.11  of the City Charter.)
   (22)   Amending Resolution or Ordinance. (See Section
3.11  of the City Charter.)
   (23)   City Attorney. The City Attorney shall, when requested by any member
of Council, give a verbal opinion on any question of law concerning City
affairs, in open Council, but he or she may, if he or she deems the matter of
importance, take a reasonable time to submit his or her opinion in writing. He
or she shall not be required to draw any ordinance or resolution except upon a
majority vote of the members.
   The City Attorney, when requested by the Chairman of a committee to which
any ordinance or resolution has been referred, shall assist in the examination
of such ordinance or resolution.
   (24)   Adoption and Amendment of Council Rules. These rules shall be adopted
each year at the first regular Council meeting. These rules may be amended or
altered or new rules may be adopted at any time, but in case of any amendment
or alteration or the adoption of new rules, the matter shall be referred to the
proper committee for report, and any such amendment, alteration or new rules
shall he read on three different days, unless this rule is suspended by a
three-fourths vote of the members. Any amendment, alteration or adoption of new
rules shall be upon a majority vote of the members.
   (25)   Confidentiality of Executive Sessions. Executive sessions of Council

234.02  SAFE VEHICLE OPERATION POLICY AND PROCEDURE.
   The Administrator is hereby authorized to promulgate and distribute copies
of the following Policy and Procedure in regard to the operation of City
vehicles.
   POLICY/PROCEDURE - VEHICLE OPERATION
Background - The operation of vehicles is an integral and essential activity in
the conduct of the City's business. Each employee's and division's productivity
is affected by the way the vehicles are operated. Vehicular accidents can be
the most costly losses considering personal injury, property damage, lost time
and liability suits.
POLICY
The safe operation of vehicles and other related activities is the
responsibility of each individual entrusted with equipment. Each department
shall establish work rules appropriate for its operations. Each department
shall maintain records that assure that equipment is properly maintained and
that all operators are eligible to drive. The City Administrator or his
designee shall maintain records of injuries and losses from accidental or
related occurrences. The City Administrator or his designee shall recommend to
the department directors personnel actions or operation methods to reduce
losses. Exceptions to this policy must be approved by the City Administrator or
his designee and the respective department director.
PROCEDURES
A)   Qualifications for Driving on City Business
   1.   Any full or part-time employee operating a vehicle on City business
must meet the following requirements.
      a)   Must be at least eighteen (18) years old.
      b)   Must have current, valid Ohio driver's license with proper
endorsements. A copy of the license must be on file in the employee's personnel
file.
      c)   Must notify his or her department director of any non- parking
traffic violation within ten (10) days of conviction. Failure to do so may be
cause for immediate dismissal.
      d)   In the event that Ohio driver's license rules, classifications or
endorsements change, must take those steps necessary to obtain the appropriate
endorsements.
      e)   Must be familiar with operation of equipment to be operated.
      f)   Within prior thirty-six (36) months, must have no more than six (6)
moving violation points or conviction of any of the following: DUI, PAC, hit
and run, vehicular homicide or other major violation.
      g)   Must be eligible for coverage under the City's vehicle insurance
carrier.
      h)   In case of a vehicular accident directly attributable to a physical
impairment, an employee may be required to submit to a physical examination. A
physician's report regarding determination of fitness to operate a vehicle on
City business shall be reviewed by the City Administrator or his designee for
purposes of continuing driving privileges.
         Failure to maintain these requirements shall mean loss of driving
privileges for activities of City business.  Lack of driving privileges may be
cause for reassignment, demotion or dismissal.  An employee's failure to
provide proof of a current valid Ohio driver's license, with proper
endorsements, to the department director may be grounds for disciplinary
action. Each department director is responsible for maintaining the above
information on file.
   2.   The City Administrator or his designee shall obtain the driving record
for all employees with driving privileges. These reports shall be reviewed at
the discretion of the City Administrator or his designee.
   3.   City employees must attend and successfully complete training sessions
as determined appropriate and necessary by their department director.
B)   Prospective and New Employees
   1.   Prospective employees must have a history of safe operation of vehicles
and meet the requirements of Section A. Driving history may be cause for
elimination from consideration for employment or promotion.
   2.   The City Administrator or his designee shall request an MVR for
prospective employees and shall advise the appointing authority of the
prospective employee's status.
   3.   During the employee's probationary period (or first six (6) months if
there is no probationary period), the employee's supervisor shall observe the
employee's driving habits on each type of vehicle the employee operates. The
employee's driving record may be grounds for disciplinary action, including
dismissal.
C)   Operation of City Vehicles
   1.   Drivers must inspect the vehicle prior to operation. Defects in any
components must be noted and reported to the employee's supervisor prior to
use. Otherwise, damage could be attributed to the driver using the vehicle when
the damage is discovered.
   2.   If the vehicle is believed to be unsafe, the employee shall report it
to the supervisor who shall determine how to proceed.
   3.   Seat belts where provided must be worn by all vehicle occupants.
Passengers may ride only where the vehicle is designed to carry passengers.
   4.   Only those with official business may be passengers in any City
vehicle.
   5.   When not attended for a long period of time or in a high traffic area,
nonemergency vehicles must be kept locked.
   6.   No personal equipment shall be installed in a City-owned vehicle.
   7.   Vehicles shall be maintained through a preventive maintenance program
administered by each department. Maintenance intervals shall be based on
mileage or machine hours where appropriate. Each department shall maintain
equipment usage and maintenance records.
D)   Accidents Occurring in City Vehicles or During Conduct of City Business
   1.   Drivers and passengers must report any accident in writing listing the
events before and after the accident.  This report shall be delivered to the
employee's supervisor and forwarded to the department head.  The forms to be
completed can be obtained from the employee's supervisor. The forms may differ
in format based upon the needs of each department's supervisor.
   2.   The employee's department/division is responsible for repair of the
vehicle and must contact the City Administrator or his designee before allowing
any repairs.
   3.   The driver must complete and review with his supervisor the Accident
Report provided by the City and forward it to the department director if the
department director and the supervisor are not the same person.
   4.   The department director shall review the report and forward it to the
City Administrator or his designee for further disposition as set forth above
and beyond that recommended or given by the department director.
E)   Operation of City Vehicles Away From Work
   1.   Vehicles shall be used only for City business except as noted below. 
Each department shall issue directives regarding assignment of vehicles which
may include commuting.  Vehicles driven home by employees must be parked in
off-street sites after dark.
   2.   Use of the vehicle that does not relate directly to the performance of
the driver's work assignment is prohibited unless approved by the department
director.  Non- authorized drivers or passengers are prohibited unless approved
by the department director.  Insurance may not be in effect during unauthorized
use. 
(Ord. 90-9.  Passed 5-10-90.)

rule. Revisions following the initial notification are not subject to the
notice requirement and may be agreed upon at the Commission meeting.
B.   The public notice must contain a statement of the Commission's intention
to alter or adopt a rule, and a statement as to the subject matter of the rule
to be affected. In addition, the notice must contain the date, time and place
set for the consideration of the rule change.
C.   A copy of the full text of any proposed rule or rule change shall be
submitted to the Mayor at least two (2) days prior to the date set for
consideration.
D.   Civil Service Commission rules shall be adopted by a majority vote and
entered into  the minutes. Interested parties may provide input in writing,
preferably in advance, or offer written or oral input at the meeting(s) called
to consider the rules or rule changes.  Civil Service Commission rules, once
adopted by a majority vote and entered into the minutes, will be submitted to
City Council for adoption as an ordinance.  Copies of the rules or rule
changes, together with the minutes of the Civil  Service Commission adopting
the change and a copy of the ordinance enacting the change, will be kept by the
designee of the Commission and made available  to any person upon request. Due
notice of the contents of such rules and of all changes shall be given to
appointing authorities affected by such rules, and such rules shall be printed
for public distribution.
1-08  Scope of the Rules
A.   These rules shall be applicable to all civil service matters, except to
the extent these rules have been superseded by collective bargaining agreements
between the City of Northwood and a public employee collective bargaining
representative, or by Charter or ordinance.
B.   No person shall be appointed, removed, transferred, laid off, suspended,
reinstated, promoted, or reduced as an officer or employee in the Civil Service
of the City of Northwood, Ohio in any manner or by any means other than those
prescribed in these rules, except as provided in (A) above.
1-09  Construction
A.   These rules should be construed so as to carry out their purposes as
determined from both the literal reading of the rules and their context.  The
rules should be construed and applied in a manner that is consistent with the
laws of the State of Ohio, except to the extent that the letter or context of
the City Charter or City ordinances indicate that the City intended to
supersede, preempt, or otherwise override state law through a valid exercise of
Home Rule.  The rules should not be construed so as to limit the City's power
to exercise Home Rule, except to the extent that the City has limited itself in
the City Charter.  Nor should the rules be construed in a way that limits the
Civil Service Commission's power to interpret and apply the rules within the
scope of their lawful authority.
B.   A Charter provision will prevail over any conflicting ordinance.  An
ordinance will prevail over any conflicting rule.  Any applicable collective
bargaining agreement that provides for binding arbitration of grievances and
that conflicts with the Charter, an ordinance, or these rules will prevail over
any of the foregoing, pursuant to Chapter 4117 of the Ohio Revised Code, unless
the subject matter is not a proper subject for collective bargaining.  In
particular, persons convicted of certain felonies under R.C. 124.34 lose
certain rights notwithstanding any collective bargaining agreement.

CLASSIFICATION
3-01  Classification
A.   The Civil Service Commission shall establish, and may modify or repeal, by
rule,  a job classification plan for all classified positions, officers and
employment situations in the employ of the City of Northwood, Ohio.
B.   Positions in the Civil Service of the City shall be classified in
accordance with the classification plan, which shall provide that any and all
positions whose duties, responsibilities, and necessary qualifications are
sufficiently alike to so warrant shall be allocated to the same class with a
title which shall be descriptive of the duties performed.
C.   Class Series
   The Civil Service Commission may designate a class series to be made up of
job  classes having related functions that form a career progression.
3-02  Class Specification
A class specification shall be prepared for each job classification setting
forth a class title, salary range, typical duties and responsibilities, and the
necessary qualifications. This class specification shall set forth the factors
and conditions which are essential characteristics of the class and also those
factors or conditions which differentiate it from other classes.
3-03  Reclassification
A.   Whenever a new position is established or the duties of a position are so
changed that the statement of duties and typical tasks of the class to which it
was originally allocated no longer applies, the appointing authority shall
report such fact to the Commission and transmit a full statement of the
circumstances and description of the duties. The Commission shall thereupon,
after investigation, determine the proper classification of such position. The
Commission shall from time to time make an investigation of all positions in
the  service to determine whether such positions are allocated to the proper
classifications. Any employee or his authorized representative or any
appointing authority desiring to submit facts for consideration of the
Commission shall be afforded reasonable opportunity to do so. When the
Commission finds improper classifications of positions exist the Commission may
reallocate any position to the appropriate class as is necessary to provide an
equitable, just and proper classification.
B.    Any employee may request a review of the classification of his position
for the  purposes of determining whether the position is properly classified.
The  Commission shall give proper consideration to such request.
3-04  Notification of Employees
Whenever the classification title of a position is changed other than by
promotion or  demotion, the Commission shall notify in writing, any employee
affected by the  change as well as the employee's appointing authority.
3-05  Specification Amendments
Where particular licenses or attributes, such as insurability, are essential
characteristics or functions of a position, the class series specification may
be amended to so reflect. Such amendments may be requested by the appointing
authority or may  be made independently by the Civil Service Commission, and
must be reflected on the  minutes of the Commission.
CHAPTER FOUR
APPLICATIONS
4-01  How Made
All applications, whether for employment or for examination, must be made
under  oath or affirmation and upon forms prescribed by the Civil Service
Commission. All application forms must be completed in their entirety and
printed legibly in ink (by  the person unless such person is disabled, in which
case “reasonable accommodation” will be made) and submitted to the Civil
Service Commission in a timely manner. The application forms of individuals who
successfully complete applications will be retained by the Civil Service
Commission for two (2) years.  Applications for such persons who are placed on
eligible lists shall be retained by the Civil Service Commission during the
effective period of the eligible list or for two (2) years, whichever is
greater.  The application forms of individuals who are appointed to or employed
in any classified civil service position shall be retained by the Civil Service
Commission during the tenure of said employee.  After the expiration of any of
the foregoing retention periods, the Commission will retain or dispose of the
records in accordance with the procedures established by the Records
Commission.
The Commission shall make reasonable accommodations available to otherwise
qualified persons with disabilities to afford them access to the application
and examination process.
4-02  Forms
At the first meeting of the Civil Service Commission following January 1 of
each  year, the Commission will review the prescribed form or forms, make any
changes  that are deemed necessary, and, by majority vote, approve the form or
forms to be used for the next ensuing year.
Application forms shall be available in the office of the Commission or at
other locations as announced by the Civil Service Commission. To the extent
that the same are reasonably necessary in the application process, the Civil
Service Commission may require of applicants such references as to the
character of the applicant provided by persons having knowledge of the same as
the Commission may require.
4-03  Residency
Every applicant for a position in the classified service must be a citizen of
the United States, or must legally declare and signify in writing his or her
intention to become, upon appointment, a citizen of the United States.
Furthermore, every such applicant must be a resident of the state of Ohio or
signify in writing his or her intention to become and remain, upon appointment,
a resident of Ohio within six (6) months, unless such requirements are
specifically waived by Charter, ordinance, or statute; except that no residency
requirement applies to temporary or exceptional appointments (see Chapter 8 for
a description of such appointments).
4-04  Disqualification of Applicants
The Commission may refuse to examine, or, after an examination, refuse to
certify as eligible, or after certification revoke that certification, of any
person: who is found to lack any of the established preliminary requirements
for the examination; who is physically so disabled as to be rendered unfit for
the performance of the duties of the position which he seeks, who is addicted
to the habitual use of intoxicating liquors or drugs to excess, who has been
convicted of a felony, theft offense, domestic violence including lesser

delinquency or misconduct, or who has made false statements of any material
fact, or practiced, or attempted to practice, any deception or fraud in his or
her application or in his or her examination, in establishing his or her
eligibility, or securing his or her appointment. In relation to such inquiries
the Civil Service Commission may require such certificates of persons having
knowledge of the applicant as the good of the civil service may require,
subject to the requirements of the Fair Credit Reporting Act, if and to the
extent those provisions are applicable.  The Commission may also take into
consideration that convictions (e.g., for misdemeanors) are more than seven (7)
years old.
4-05  Age and Peace Officer Certification Restrictions for Police
A.   Minimum Age for Application: 
Applicants for original appointment examination in the Police Department must
have attained the age of twenty-one (21) years on or before the last date
applications to take the test are accepted.
B.   Peace Officer Certification and Education Requirements: 
   1.   No application for entry level police civil service testing will be
accepted unless the candidate can offer proof that, at the time of application,
he or she does possess an Associate’s Degree or completion of 96 quarter hours
or 64 semester hours towards a Bachelor's Degree from an accredited college or
university; or education may be substituted with five (5) years of continuous

109.77.
   2.   In the event that there are fewer than ten (10) candidates qualified
for testing under paragraph (B)(1) hereof, the Civil Service Commission may
waive the certification requirement for any candidate who has signed and
tendered to the Civil Service Commission a “Contract for Reimbursement of
Hiring and Training Expenses,” a copy of which is attached to original
Ordinance 95-26, passed May 25, 1995, and incorporated as if set forth herein.
   3.   Unless an emergency is jointly declared by the Mayor or the Municipal
Administrator, and the Civil Service Commission, no peace officer shall be
hired by the City except as set forth in paragraph (B)(1) or (2) hereof.
      In the event that any part of this section is held invalid or
unenforceable, the remainder shall remain in full force and effect.
      In the event that paragraph (B)(2) hereof is held to be invalid or
unenforceable by any court, agency, or arbitrator, all employees hired under
paragraph (B)(2) hereof will be immediately determined to have been
“unqualified” and unlawfully appointed and will be immediately discharged based
upon noncompliance with paragraph (B)(1) hereof.  (See Chapter 10 of these
rules regarding procedures for removal.)
      This rule is intended to prevail over any other rules governing the same
subject matter covered herein.
4-06  Promotional Restrictions: Police
A.   Vacancies above the rank of patrolman in the Police Department shall be
filled by promotion from among persons serving with the Northwood Police
Department holding the next immediately lower rank after passing a competitive
promotional examination.
B.   Whenever a vacancy occurs in the promoted ranks of the Police Department,
no  person shall be eligible to take the promotional examination unless he or
she has served at least forty-eight (48) months in the lower rank with at least
thirty-six (36) of these months served in the Northwood Police Department.  No
competitive promotional examination shall be held unless there are at least two
(2) persons eligible to compete.  If the Civil Service Commission determines
that there are less than two (2) persons holding positions in the rank next
lower than the position to be filled, who are eligible and willing to compete,
the Commission shall allow the persons holding positions in the then next lower
rank who are eligible, to compete with the persons holding positions in the
rank lower than the position to be filled.
C.   In the event that only one (1) person applies for a promotional
appointment examination, a provisional appointment may be made, provided that
the appointee otherwise meets the minimum qualifications. Such appointment need
not be the sole applicant for the promotional appointment examination.
D.   A person serving as a provisional employee who passes an examination for
the position which he or she holds, shall be appointed as a permanent certified
employee prior to the preparation of an eligible list by the Civil Service
Commission.
E.   Any provisional employee who remains in provisional status in the same
classification for a period of two (2) years of continuous service, during

period.
4-07  Equal Employment Opportunity Applicant Flow Information

in  documenting Equal Employment Opportunity applicant flow statistics.
This Equal Employment Opportunity applicant flow information sheet may be
furnished to all applicants for employment or examination.
The completion of the Equal Employment Opportunity applicant flow information
sheet by applicants for testing or employment shall be wholly voluntary, and
no  applicant shall be adversely affected in any way for having refused to
complete such form.
Once completed, Equal Employment Opportunity applicant flow information sheets
shall be physically separated from the application and separately filed as a 
confidential EEO compliance record.
CHAPTER FIVE
EXAMINATIONS
5-01  Examinations; Provisional Appointments
A.   Examinations for appointments must be competitive, and no such examination
will be administered unless there are at least two (2) applicants. All
applicants for positions in the classified civil service shall be subject to
examination.  However, where the Civil Service Commission determines that the
best interests of the civil service will be served by filling a vacancy through
reduction, transfer, reinstatement, or promotion without competition, the
vacancy will be filled by one of those methods, at the discretion of the Civil
Service Commission, rather than by examination and certification of names from
a list of eligibles.  (The rationale being that the person to be reduced,
transferred, promoted, or reinstated has presumably already demonstrated his or
her qualifications for the position.)  The reduction, transfer, reinstatement,
or promotion will be subject to the rules governing those actions.
   There shall be two basic types of examinations administered by the Civil
Service Commission in accordance with these rules:
   1.   examinations for original appointments;
   2.   examinations for promotion.
   Examinations for original appointments shall be open to all individuals who
otherwise qualify for appointment to or employment in a position under these
rules.  The Commission shall decide whether a position will be filled by
promotional examination, rather than open-competitive examination.  Vacancies
in positions in the classified service shall be filled insofar as practicable
by promotions.  The Commission may consult with the appointing authority when
making the determination.  The Commission may also hold a combined promotional
and open-competitive examination, resulting in two eligibility lists, of which
the promotional list shall have priority (see Eligibility Lists).
   If the examination is promotional, the Commission shall decide which classes
of employees may take the examination, whether the employees must be certified
in their current positions, and whether they must have completed their
probationary periods in order to compete.  The Commission may also determine
that other persons in the classified service are eligible to compete in a
promotional examination, if they otherwise meet the minimum qualifications for
the promotional position.  These provisions are subject to more specific time
in rank requirements for Police Department promotions.
   Examinations may include an evaluation of such factors as education,
training, capacity, knowledge, manual dexterity, physical or psychological
fitness, driving record, criminal record, job-related background, and/or
insurability .  Examinations may consist of one test, or of more than one test
in combination.  Tests may be written, oral, physical, demonstration of ability
to perform essential functions, or an evaluation of training and experience,
and shall be designed to fairly test the relative capacity of the persons
examined to discharge the particular duties of the position or classification
for which appointment is sought.  Where minimum or maximum requirements are
established for any examination, the same shall be specified in the examination
announcement.
B.   Examinations for appointments must be competitive, except as otherwise
provided herein, and no such examination will be administered unless there are
at least two (2) applicants. In the event that only one (1) person applies for
an original appointment examination, a provisional appointment may be made,
provided that the appointee otherwise meets the minimum qualifications. Such
appointment need not be the sole applicant for the original appointment
examination.
C.   A person serving as a provisional employee who passes an examination for
the position which he holds, shall be appointed as a permanent certified
employee prior to the preparation of an eligible list by the Civil Service
Commission.
D.   Any provisional employee who remains in provisional status in the same
classification for a period of two (2) years of continuous service, during
which period no competitive examination is held, shall become a permanent
appointee in the classified service at the conclusion of such two (2) year
period.
5-02  Examination Notices And Sites
A.   Examinations for original or promotional appointments shall be held at
such times and in such places as the Civil Service Commission deems
appropriate,  and shall be administered in accordance with the applicable
sections of R.C. Chapter 124 and these regulations.
B.   Printed public notice of each examination for original appointment in the
classified  service shall be given through the local newspapers and shall be
posted in conspicuous places in the City office buildings at least one (1) week
prior to the last date for filing application, and shall include the time,
place, and general scope of the competitive examination. In addition, the
Commission may cause the notice to be given or posted in such other places as
it may deem advisable.
C.   Notice of promotional examinations shall be posted in conspicuous places
in each department in which employees would be interested and eligible to
compete for such promotion. Such notices shall be posted at least one (1) week
prior to the last date for filing application, and shall include the time,
place and general scope of the competitive examination.
D.   Notices of all examinations for original appointments in the classified
service may also be distributed to such persons or organizations as the
Commission may deem to be interested in the positions to be filled.
5-03  Medical, Psychological, And Drug Testing
A.   Whenever physical or psychological qualifications are of special
importance, the applicants may be required to pass a physical or psychological
examination and be certified as qualified in such respects, whether before
admission to the examination, or before being placed on the appropriate
eligible list, or before certification for appointment, as the Commission may
deem advisable. Medical examinations will only be conducted after a prospective
appointee has received a conditional offer of employment; except that the
Commission may require that an applicant may be medically examined prior to any
test (e.g., a physical agility test) to determine the applicant's ability to
participate safely in the test.  When asking for such a medical opinion, the
Commission will describe the agility or fitness test, and ask “Can this person
safely perform this test?”  Examinations must be job- related and based on
business necessity. Police applicants may be required to take and pass physical
examinations as provided in R.C. 124.41. See also subsection 5.03(D) below.
B.   Such examinations may include a screening for the use of controlled
substances, which may include, among other things, hair testing.
C.   Physical, psychological, managerial skill, or drug screening examinations,
whenever required by the Commission or by these rules, the City Charter or R.C.
Chapter 124, shall be made by a licensed or certified professional designated
by the Commission, who shall furnish a certificate as to the applicant's
fitness for duty. The professional fee for such examinations shall not be borne
by the applicant.
D.    Physical Standards for Police
   The Civil Service Commission is authorized by law (R.C. 124.20) to establish
requirements for appointment to the Police Department.
   In addition to any other examination of employees under these rules, no
person will be eligible to receive an original appointment to the Police
Department as a police officer under the civil service laws, unless he or she
has, not more than one hundred twenty (120) days prior to appointment, passed a
physical examination, given by a licensed physician, certifying that the
applicant is free of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases, and showing that he
or she meets the physical requirements necessary to perform the essential
functions of a police officer as established by the Civil Service Commission.
   The Commission will only have such an examination conducted after the
prospective appointee has received a conditional offer of employment.  The City
will pay the fee for the physical examination.  The appointing authority shall
file the report or findings of the licensed physician with the Police and
Firemen's Disability and Pension Fund within thirty (30) days of the date the
employee becomes a member of the fund (the latter usually being the date of
hire).
5-04  Admission of Applicants to Examination
A.   No applicant shall be admitted to any assembled examination more than
thirty (30) minutes after the advertised time of beginning such examination,
nor after any applicant competing in any such examination has completed his or
her work and left the examination room, whichever shall first occur, except by
special permission of the person in charge, who, in his discretion, may admit
the applicant conditionally, subject to the final approval or disapproval of
such admission by the Commission.
B.   Any applicant admitted to an assembled examination after its advertised
time of beginning must complete the examination at the advertised ending time,
and shall receive no extension time, except as set forth in
5-06, infra.
5-05  Identity of Entry Level Examinees Concealed
The identity of all persons taking competitive entry level assembled
examinations shall be concealed by the use of an identification number which
shall be used on all examination papers. This number shall be used from the
beginning of the examination until the papers have all been rated. Any papers
bearing the name of the applicant or any other identification mark shall be
rejected and the candidate so notified.
5-06  Extension of Time in Examination
   No applicant shall be given a longer time on any subject than prescribed by
the Commission for the completion of an examination.
   Separate time limits may be established as a reasonable accommodation to a
handicapped or disabled applicant.
   Requests for additional time, or accommodation, must be submitted with
supporting  documentation at the time of filing application for the
examination.
5-07  Visitors at Examinations
No visitors shall be admitted to the examination room during any examination
except by special permission of the person in charge.
5-08  Postponement or Cancellation of Examination
A scheduled examination may be cancelled or postponed by order of the Civil
Service  Commission, for any adequate reason. Reasonable efforts shall be made
to notify each  qualified applicant of the cancellation or postponement, and
will include written notice to the applicant's last known post office address.
5-09  Fraud Prohibited
Frauds in examinations are prohibited in accordance with R.C. 124.58.  No
person or officer shall:
A.   Willfully or corruptly by himself or herself in cooperation with one or
more persons defect, deceive, or obstruct any person in respect of their right
of examination, appointment, or employment arising under the Civil Service law
or any rules and regulations prescribed pursuant thereto: or
B.   Willfully or corruptly, falsely mark, grade, estimate or report upon the
examination or proper standing of any person examined, registered, or certified
pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Service Law, or aid in so doing; or,
C.   Willfully or corruptly make any false representations concerning the
results of such examinations of concerning any person examined.
D.   Willfully or corruptly furnish to any person any special or secret
information for the purpose of either improving or injuring the prospects or
chances of any person so examined, registered or certified, or to be appointed,
employed or promoted; or
E.   Willfully personate any person or permit or aid in any manner any other
person to personate him or her in connection with any examination, registration
or appointment or application, or request to be examined, registered or
appointed; or
F.   Furnish any false information about himself or herself or any other
person, in connection with any examination, registration, or appointment or
application or request to be examined, registered or appointed; or
G.   Make known, or assist in making known to any applicant for examination,
any questions to be asked on such examination; or
H.   (For any applicant taking an examination) assist any other applicant in
any manner whatsoever; or
I.   Personally solicit a favor from any member of the Commission, appointing
officer, or any person in his or her behalf solicit a favor; or
J.   In any examination use any means of information, other than that provided
in the examination itself, such as memoranda, pamphlets, or books of any kind
to assist him in answering the questions, and if so, shall have his or her
examination papers taken up and filed with a “0" marking, when the
circumstances justify such action.
5-10  Promotional Examinations
   Vacancies in positions in the classified service shall be filled insofar as
practical by promotions as provided above (see Section 5.01(A) regarding
specifics). All examinations for promotions shall be competitive and in
writing, and  shall relate to those matters which test the ability of the
person being examined to discharge the particular duties of the position
sought. Promotional examinations shall consist of those evaluations and/or
tests described in Section 5.01(A) above.
   The identity of all promotional examination applicants shall be concealed by
the use of an identification number, which shall be used on all examination
papers. This  identification number shall be used from the beginning of the
examination until all  the examination papers have been rated. Any papers
bearing the name of the  applicant, or any other identification mark, shall be
rejected and the applicant so notified.
5-11  Limitation on Original Appointments: Police
Positions above the rank of patrol officer in the Police Department may not be
filled by original appointment.
5-12  Separate Examinations for Police
Separate examinations shall be given for positions in the Police Department and
separate rules may apply as provided in these Rules.  Also, in the Police
Department, separate tests will be given for original and promotional
appointments.
CHAPTER SIX
GRADING, ADDITIONAL CREDIT, AND INSPECTION
6-01  Minimum Passing Score
A.   The Civil Service Commission shall endeavor to ascertain the minimum
passing  grade, as determined by the compiler of any professionally prepared
civil service test. When available in advance, this information will be
included on all test notices.
B.   Where such minimum passing grade is unavailable in advance from the
professional testing service, the minimum passing grade shall be one standard
deviation below the mean score of all applicants taking the test on that date.
If the test includes multiple portions, for example, the use of a written test
plus an oral test, the Commission will score all portions of the test before
determining that an applicant can receive extra credit that can only be granted
to those achieving the minimum passing score (for example, seniority credit on
a promotional exam).  Applicants must achieve the minimum passing score,
excluding any additional credits provided by these rules, as a prerequisite for
further consideration for employment or appointment, and for certification to
an eligible list.
C.   In the event that there are only two (2) applicants for a promotional
examination, both will be deemed to have passed the examination.
6-02  Original Appointment Veterans' Credit
   All applicants for original appointment who are veterans of military
service, as described in R.C. 124.23, may file with the Commission a
certificate of satisfactory military service or honorable discharge, whereupon
he or she shall receive additional credit of five (5) points of his or her
total grade given in the regular examination, provided that he or she has
received a passing grade without regard to this or any other credit.
   Such requests for veterans' credit must be submitted to the Commission along
with the application for examination and must, at that time, be accompanied by
proof of satisfactory military service as described above. Requests for
veterans' credit made after the final date for test application will not be
honored.
6-03  Promotional Seniority Credit
A.   In promotional examinations for positions in the Police Department,
additional credit for uninterrupted full-time service within the department
shall be added to the examination grade. No credit for this seniority shall be
added to an examination grade unless the applicant achieves at least the
minimum passing score on the examination, absent any extra credit. For purposes
of this Section, departmental service interrupted by either military duty or
job-related injury shall not constitute a break in seniority.
   Notwithstanding the previous paragraph, no person who has resigned a
classified position in a police department or a fire department will receive
seniority credit for service prior to such resignation, in accordance with R.C.
124.50.
   Furthermore, any person who has either been convicted of a felony within the
meaning of R.C. 124.34 or removed from his or her position in connection with
such a conviction or the underlying facts, is barred from receiving seniority
credit, to the extent the Commission may disallow credit under that section. 
This paragraph is not meant to imply any other limitations on the Commission's
authority regarding such person.
B.   Any credit available for seniority shall be equal to one (1) point for
every five (5) years of continuous service, up to a maximum of five (5) points.
6-04  Addition of Credits
A.   Applicants for original appointment shall be entitled to only such credit
as is set  forth in
6-02 (relating to veterans' credit).
B.   Applicants for promotional appointments to the Police Department shall be
entitled only to such credit as is set forth in
6-03.
C.   In scoring all original and promotional examinations, no additional credit
shall be given to any applicant, unless such applicant has achieved the minimum
passing grade as determined prior to the addition of any additional credit and
had filed with the Commission at the time of filing application for the
examination, such proof of credit as is required by the Commission under these
rules.
6-05  Inspection and Grading of Examination Papers
A.   Any competitor shall have the right at any time within the period of ten
(10) calendar days after receiving his notice of examination grade to review
his own papers and inform himself or herself as to the markings given him or
her on each subject or question and to submit in writing for the Commission's
consideration, any objection or protest he or she may wish to make concerning
the grades given him or her.
B.   No objection or protest concerning an examination, not submitted in
writing, shall be considered unless it relates to the conduct of examiners, the
securing of unlawful assistance by a competitor, or such other circumstances in
connection with an examination as would call for an investigation on the part
of the Commission, and which would require that the information submitted be
given in confidence.
C.   An applicant who exercises the right to inspect his examination papers
shall not be permitted to again take an examination for the same classification
within a six (6) month period following the inspection, unless an alternate
form of examination is given.
D.   Inspection shall not be permitted of standardized tests prepared by
experts outside the state service, where such inspection would tend to reduce
the validity of test results.
E.   No grades given in any examination shall be changed after the posting of
an eligible list, except after the consideration of reasons submitted in
writing by the competitor objecting and report thereon by the Commission's
properly authorized examiners; provided that the Commission may correct
clerical errors of examiners or employees at any time before the cancellation
of such lists.
CHAPTER SEVEN
ELIGIBLE LISTS
7-01  Preparation of Certified Eligible Lists
The Commission shall prepare and keep open to public inspection, from the
results of each examination, a certified eligible list of those persons whose
general average score in the examination is not less than the minimum passing
grade, and who are otherwise eligible for appointment. Such persons shall take
rank upon the certified eligible list as candidates in the order of their
relative excellence as determined by the examination and any credits, without
reference to priority of the time of examination. Whenever it becomes necessary
to hold a subsequent examination in order to obtain additional eligibles, the
Commission may consolidate existing lists for the same class by rearranging the
names of those eligible therein according to their score. All those persons
whose names appear on an existing list, which is to be merged with a new list,
shall have an opportunity to compete in the second examination and shall be
given the standing on the combined list to which the higher grade received on
either examination shall entitle him or her during the continuance of the first
list and thereafter he or she shall rank in accordance with the grade received
on the subsequent examination.
7-02  Term of Eligible List
The term of eligibility of each list shall be fixed by the Commission at not
less than one (1) nor more than two (2) years. When an eligible list is reduced
to ten (10) names or less, a new list may be prepared. Any list that has been
in effect for more than one (1) year may, at the discretion of the Commission,
be terminated at any time in the public interest.
7-03  Ties--Original Appointment Eligible Lists
In the event that two (2) or more applicants receive the same score in an
original appointment examination, priority in the time of filing the
application with the Commission shall determine the order in which their names
shall be placed on the eligible list; provided that applicants eligible for
veterans preference under R.C. 124.23 shall receive priority in rank on the
eligible list over non-veterans on the list with a rating equal to that of the
veterans. Ties among veterans shall be decided by priority of the filing of the
application.
7-04  Ties--Promotional Eligible Lists
In the event that two (2) or more applicants receive the same mark on a
promotional examination, seniority shall determine the order in which names
shall be placed on the eligible list.
At the discretion of the Commission, the name of any eligible may, at any time,
upon his or her written request, be transferred to the eligible list for a
lower class in the same classification series requiring qualifications of the
same general character. The adoption of such additional placement shall be
extended to all eligibles on the list. The person shall be ranked thereon
according to his or her original score.
7-05  Disqualification From Eligible List and Waiver
A.   The name of any person appearing on an eligible list who:
   1.   fails to report or arrange within six (6) days from date of
notification (Saturday, Sunday, City holiday excluded) for an interview with
the appropriate appointing authority;
   2.   fails to respond to a notice from the Commission;
   3.   fails to report for work after accepting appointment;
   4.   fails to pass a qualifying test prior to appointment;
   5.   lacks any of the established requirements for the classification:
   6.   has made false statements on his or her application;
   7.   separates from employment with the City;
   8.   has received a permanent appointment through certification from an 
eligibility list for another position of equal or more salary or rate;
   9.   has become incapacitated subsequent to examination;
   10.   has had errors discovered in the computation of the examination score
of the eligible;
   11.   has requested that his or her name be removed;
   12.   fails to file with the Commission written notice of change of address,
or, for whom notification is provided by postal authorities of their inability
to locate him or her at last known address;
   13.   becomes deceased;
   14.   for any of the reasons set forth in Chapter Four which would have
caused his or her application to have been rejected:
   shall not thereafter be certified to any appointing authority as eligible
for  appointment. The potentially disqualified person shall be notified
concerning the application of this section unless his or her whereabouts are
unknown. The disqualified candidate's name may again be certified from the
eligible list only where a thoroughly satisfactory explanation of the
circumstances is made to the Commission. In the event of the refusal of an
appointment by an eligible candidate, the appointing authority shall so notify
the Commission.
B.   In case an eligible person's name appears on more than one list,
appointment  to a position in one class shall be considered a waiver for
appointment from eligible lists for classes in which the salary is equal or
lower.
C.   If, at any time after the creation of an eligible list, the Commission has
reason to believe that any person whose name appears on any list is
disqualified from appointment because of false statements made on his or her
application, inability to perform the job duties, lack of a necessary license,
lack of insurability, or for other comparable reasons; such person shall be
notified and given an opportunity to be heard. If such person shall fail to
appear for hearing, or upon being heard, fail to satisfy the Commission, his or
her name shall be removed from such eligible list.
D.   A request for waiver of certification and appointment or reinstatement,
specifying reasons for such request, must be filed with the Commission within 
three (3) work days after the eligible individual has been notified of his or
her certification to the appointing authority. A certification is not charged
when the waiver is approved. Denial of such waiver shall cause removal from the
eligible list.
   Except that each eligible on a particular list, if a present City of
Northwood employee, may receive, upon receipt of his written request, one (1)
automatic waiver from certification and appointment from that eligibility list.
Such request must be filed with the Commission within three (3) work days after
the eligible employee has been notified of his certification to the appointing
authority.  In such instance where a sufficient number of eligibles are not
available for certification for a particular position due to the use of the 
automatic waiver, those eligible utilizing automatic waivers will again be
certified in the usual manner.
7-06  Duty of Eligibles
Each person on an eligible list shall file with the Commission written notice
of any change of address, and failure to do so may be considered sufficient
reason for not certifying his or her name to the appointing authorities for
future appointment.
7-07  Revocation of Eligible List
An eligible list may be revoked and another examination ordered during the
first year of its term (see Section 7.02, Term of Eligible List) only when, in
the judgment of the Commission, such action is deemed advisable by reason of
errors, fraud, or obviously inappropriate standards prescribed in connection
with any examination. All competitors in the first examination shall be
notified and shall be eligible to compete in the rescheduled examination
without filing a separate application or the payment of an additional fee. No
certified eligible list shall be altered or revoked, except upon written notice
to all persons whose standing may be affected and upon an entry in the minutes
of the Commission of the reasons for such alteration or revocation.
CHAPTER EIGHT
APPOINTMENTS
8-01  Appointments in General
Vacancies in positions in the service of the City are not to be filled or
required to be filled until such time as the position is certified as vacant
with a need for appointment thereto by the appointing authority.
Appointments to all positions in the classified service, other than those that
are filled by exempt promotion, transfer, or reduction, as provided in Sections
124.01 to 124.64 of the Ohio Revised Code, and the Rules and Regulations of the
Commission, shall be made only from those persons whose names are certified to
the appointing authority in accordance with these Rules.
8-02  Appointment Procedure; Number of Names Certified
A.   The appointing authority of a department in which a position in the
classified service is to be filled shall notify the Commission of the
classification title and the number of positions to be filled. Upon the receipt
of this, the Commission shall, except as otherwise provided in R.C. 124.27,
R.C. 124.30 (relating to provisional, temporary, and other exceptional
appointments; see Section 8.09); and R.C. 124.31 (relating to promotions); and
these rules, certify to the appointing authority the names and addresses of the
ten (10) candidates standing highest on the eligible list for the class or
grade to which the position belongs; provided that the Commission may certify
less than ten (10) names if ten (10) names are not available. When less than
six (6) names are certified to an appointing authority, appointment from that
list shall not be mandatory.
B.   The appointing authority, having notified the Commission of the position
to be filled, and having received such certified eligible list, may then
appoint. Except as provided in 8-03 with respect to promotion within the Police
Department, the  appointing authority shall fill such position by appointment
of one (1) of the ten (10)  persons certified to him or her. If more than one
position is to be filled, the  Commission may certify a group of names from the
eligible list. In the event that two (2) vacancies occur, the Commission shall
certify twelve (12) persons; in  the event of three (3) vacancies, fourteen
(14) persons; in the event of four (4)  vacancies, sixteen (16) persons.
C.   If an eligible list becomes exhausted and until a new list can be created;
or when  no eligible list for such position exists, names may be certified from
eligible lists  most appropriate for the group or class in which the position
to be filled is  classified.
D.   Certification of Names for Promotional Appointment
   When vacancies are to be filled by promotion, the Commission shall certify
to the appointing authority only the names of the three (3) persons having the
highest ratings on the eligible list.
E.   Certification of Names to Displace Provisional Appointee
   The Commission may also certify names from an eligible list to displace a
provisional appointee who has not been automatically certified through two (2)
years continuous service under R.C. 124.271, and who failed to take and pass
the examination.
8-03  Promotional Appointments in Police Department
In the case of a promotional appointment to be made in the Police Department,
the Commission shall certify to the appointing authority the names of the three
(3) persons standing highest on the list. Upon such certification, the
appointing authority shall appoint from the three (3) persons so certified
within thirty (30) days of certification.
8-04  Removal From Eligible List
A person certified from an eligible list three (3) times to the same appointing
authority for the same or similar positions may be omitted from future
certification to such appointing authority, provided that certification for a
temporary appointment shall not be counted as one of such certifications.
8-05  Veterans Preference on Original Appointments
A veteran of military service, who has been honorably discharged or separated
under honorable conditions therefrom, and who is a resident of Ohio, and whose
name is on the eligible list for a position, shall be entitled to preference in
an original appointment to such competitive position over any other person
eligible for such appointment and standing on the certified eligible list
thereof with a rating equal to that of each such person.
8-06  Probationary Periods
A.   All original appointments, including provisional appointments made
pursuant to R.C. 124.30, shall be for a probationary period of one (1) year (12
months). All promotional appointments including those in the Police Department
shall be probationary for a period of one hundred twenty (120) days.
B.   No promotion shall be final until the appointee has satisfactorily served
his probationary period.
C.   Service as a provisional employee in the same or similar class shall be
included in the probationary period.
8-07  Removal or Reduction During Probation
If the service of a probationary employee is unsatisfactory, he or she may be
removed or returned to his or her prior position without right of appeal at any
time during the probationary period. If the appointing authority's decision is
to remove the appointee, the appointing authority's communication to the Civil
Service Commission shall indicate the reason for such decision (e.g. “I found
the appointee's service to be unsatisfactory to warrant continued employment in
the position.”)
8-08  Provisional Service
Any employee in the classified service of the City of Northwood, Ohio, who is
appointed provisionally to fill a vacancy and who remains in provisional status
in the same classification for a period of two (2) years of continuous service,
during which period no competitive examination is held, shall become a
permanent appointee in the classified service at the conclusion of such two (2)
year period.  A person serving as a provisional employee who passes an
examination for the position which he or she holds, shall be appointed as a
permanent certified employee prior to the preparation of an eligible list by
the Civil Service Commission.
8-09  Temporary or Exceptional Appointments
Positions in the classified service may be filled without competition as
follows:
A.   Whenever there are urgent reasons for filling a vacancy in any position in
the classified service and the Commission is unable to certify to the
appointing authority, upon request by the latter, a list of persons eligible
for appointment to such position after a competitive examination, the
appointing authority may nominate a person to the Commission for non-
competitive examination; and, if such nominee is certified by the Commission as
qualified after such non-competitive examination, they may be appointed
provisionally to fill such vacancy until a selection and appointment can be
made after competitive examination: but, such provisional appointment shall
continue in force only until a regular appointment can be made from eligible
lists prepared by the  Commission, and such eligible list shall be prepared
within six (6) months, provided that an examination for the position must be
held within said six (6) month period from the date of such provisional
appointment;
B.   In case of an emergency, an appointment may be made without regard to
these  rules for a period not exceeding thirty (30) days, but in no case shall
successive appointments be made.
C.   In case of a vacancy in a position in the classified service where
peculiar and exceptional qualifications of a scientific, managerial,
professional or educational  character are required, and upon satisfactory
evidence that for specified reasons competition in such special case is
impracticable, and that the position can best be filled by a selection of some
designated person of high and recognized attainments in such qualities, the
Commission may suspend the provisions of R.C. 124.01 to 124.06 and these rules
requiring competition in such case, but no such suspension shall be general in
its application, and all such cases of suspension shall be reported in the
annual report of the Commission with the reasons for this suspension.
D.   Where the services to be rendered by an appointee are for a temporary
period, not to exceed one (1) month, and the need for such service is important
and urgent, the appointing authority may select for such temporary service any
person, including any person on the proper list of those eligible for permanent
appointment. Successive temporary appointments to the same position shall not 
be made under this division. The acceptance or refusal by an eligible of a
temporary appointment shall not affect his or her standing on the register for
permanent employment; nor shall the period of temporary service be counted as a
part of the probationary service in case of subsequent appointment to a
permanent position (see R.C. 124.27, 124.27.1 and 124.30). All such temporary
appointments shall be promptly reported to the Civil Service Commission.
8-10  Prior Service Provision
Any person who, upon the effective date of Section
9.02 of the Charter, had satisfactory service in the employment of the
Municipality for a period of one (1) year during a period of two (2) years
immediately prior to such date, may be appointed to serve in the same or a
similar position in the classified service without competitive examination and
shall be deemed to have served any required probationary period.
CHAPTER NINE
TRANSFERS
9-01  Transfers in General
Transfer of an employee in the Classified Service may be made by the Appointing
Authority as follows:
A.   Without Consent of Employee
   An employee may be temporarily transferred by the Appointing Authority from
his or her original position to a similar position within the same department
for a  period not to exceed thirty (30) days only during a six (6) month
period.
B.   With Consent of Employee
   By mutual consent between the employee and the Appointing Authority, an 
employee may be transferred from a position in one department to a similar
position in another department for a period of more than thirty (30) days and
less than ninety-one (91) days.
C.   With Consent of the Commission
   The Appointing Authority, upon receiving approval from the Commission, may 
permanently transfer an employee to a similar position in another department, 
where it is necessary for the efficient operation of the office.
D.   Notice of any transfer and the reasons therefor shall be given to the
employee concerned in writing at least fourteen (14) days prior to the
effective date of the change, unless it constitutes an emergency.
E.   Request for approval of all transfers shall be submitted to and approved
by the Municipal Civil Service Commission or its designee.
CHAPTER TEN
TENURE, REDUCTION, SUSPENSION, REMOVAL, AND DEMOTION
10-01  Tenure of Office
A.   The tenure of every officer or employee in the classified service of the
City of Northwood, Ohio shall be during good behavior and efficient service,
and no such officer or employee shall be reduced in pay or position, fined in
excess of five (5) days' pay, suspended, or removed, except as provided in R.C.
124.32, and these rules, for incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty,
drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the
public, neglect of duty, violation of such sections of R.C. Chapter 124 or the
rules of the Commission, or any other failure of good behavior, or any other
acts of misfeasance, malfeasance, or nonfeasance in office, or conviction of a
felony as provided in R.C. 124.34, or removal under Section 4.04(C).
   Notwithstanding the reference here to fines in excess of five (5) days' pay,
fines in excess of three (3) days' pay require the filing of an order as
specified in R.C. 124.34 and Rule 10.02, and may be appealed to the Civil
Service Commission.  See Rule 10.03:  Special Provisions Regarding Disciplinary
Suspensions and Fines.
B.   Special provisions in R.C. 124.40 establish tenure and the grounds for
suspension and/or removal of the Chief of Police, and shall apply unless
superseded by Charter or ordinance.
C.   A finding of the Ohio Ethics Commission, based upon a preponderance of the
evidence that the facts alleged in a complaint under Section 102.06 of the
Revised Code constitute a violation of Chapter 102, Section 2921.42, or Section
2921.43 of the Revised Code may constitute grounds for dismissal.
D.   Failure to file a statement or falsely filing a statement required by
Section 102.02 of the Revised Code may also constitute grounds for dismissal.
10-02  Procedure in General
A.   In any case of reduction, suspension of more than three (3) working days,
fine in excess of three (3) days' pay, or removal (excluding a removal under 8-
07), the appointing authority shall notify  such employee by furnishing such
employee with a copy of the order of  reduction, suspension, or removal, which
order shall state the reasons therefor.  Such order shall be filed with the
Commission. The procedures set forth in Chapter 11 shall apply.
B.   Within ten (10) days following the date on which the order is served, the
employee may file an appeal, in writing, with the Commission, unless the
employee was removed for a felony within the meaning of R.C. 124.34 (or was
removed or reduced during the probationary period). In the event such an appeal
is filed, the Commission shall forthwith notify the appointing authority and
shall hear,  or appoint a hearing officer or trial board to hear, such appeal
within thirty (30)  days from and after its filing with the Commission, and it
may affirm, disaffirm, or modify the judgement of the appointing authority.
C.   In cases of suspension, removal, or reduction in pay or position for
disciplinary reasons, either the appointing authority or the officer or
employee may appeal the decision of the Commission to the Court of Common Pleas
of Wood County in accordance with the procedure provided by R.C. 2506.01.
10-03  Special Provisions Regarding Certain Disciplinary Suspensions and Fines
An employee may be suspended for a period not to exceed three (3) working days
for disciplinary purposes, or fined for an amount not in excess of three (3)
days' pay, without a right of appeal to the Civil Service Commission.
Furthermore, although an employee may appeal and the Commission may affirm,
disaffirm, or modify a fine in excess of three (3) days' pay under R.C. 124.34,
the Appointing Authority need cite the grounds listed in R.C. 124.34 only for
fines in excess of five (5) days' pay.  In order to reconcile the seeming
inconsistency in R.C. 124.34, when presented with an appeal of a fine in excess
of three (3) days' pay, but not in excess of five (5) days' pay, the Commission
will first determine if the appointing authority has filed the order issuing
the fine with the Commission.  If not, the fine will be disaffirmed, as would
any disciplinary action that must be filed with the Commission and is not
filed.
CHAPTER ELEVEN
HEARING PROCEDURE
11-01  Time of Hearing; Notifications
Upon receipt from an employee or officer in the classified service of the City
of a timely appeal from an order of removal, reduction in pay or position, or
suspension for more than three (3) working days, or fines in excess of three
(3) days' pay, the Commission shall set a time and place to hear such appeal
and shall notify the appropriate appointing authority, as well as the employee
and his or her attorney, if known, thereof. Such notice must be in writing and
mailed to the last known post office address of each party.
11-02  Amendments to Order
Amendments to the orders of removal, reduction in pay or position, or
suspension for more than three (3) working days, or fines in excess of three
(3) days' pay, may be made by the appointing authority at any time, provided
the employee and his or her attorney, if any, are notified of the amended order
prior to ten (10) calendar days before the time set for the hearing as herein
provided.
11-03  Hearing Procedure
Hearings before the Commission may be public, except when the nature of the
charge may be offensive to public morality and decency.  In such cases, the
Commission may order the hearings closed to the general public, unless the
employee requests that the hearing be public.  By agreement of the parties, or
if the discussion of any issue or item would violate any person's right to
privacy, other than an employee requesting a public hearing, the Commission may
conduct an in camera review of that matter.
In the hearing of such appeals, the order of procedure shall be as follows:
   1.   The appointing authority taking action affecting the employee shall
present evidence in support of the charges and specifications.
   2.   The employee affected shall then produce such evidence as he or she may
wish to present to refute such charges.
   3.   The appointing authority may offer evidence in rebuttal.
   4.   The Commission may, in its discretion, then hear arguments presented in
the same order as set forth in 1. through 3.
11-04  Rules of Evidence; Representation by Counsel
The production of evidence on the hearing of appeals and the Commission's
decision thereof shall be governed in general by the rules of evidence applied
by courts in civil cases. The appellee or appellant may be represented by
counsel or other representative.
11-05  Burden of Proof
The appointing authority shall prove, by a preponderance of the evidence, the
factual allegations contained in the disciplinary order. Failure to prove each
of the allegations contained in the order does not require disaffirmance.
11-06  Hearsay
The Commission may permit the introduction of evidence otherwise excludable as
hearsay, provided there is established some foundation as to its reliability.
11-07  Discovery
The Commission may allow either party to conduct discovery upon notice to the
Commission.
11-08  Subpoenas
Either party may request that a subpoena be issued by the Commission. Such
requests must be submitted no later than twenty-four (24) hours prior to the
hearing and must be accompanied by a completed subpoena form. It is the
responsibility of the requesting party to serve the subpoena.
11-09  Witnesses
Each party may call witnesses to testify in his or her behalf. All witnesses
must testify under oath or affirmation. The Commission on its own initiative
may call witnesses other than those called by either party if in its judgment
the merits of the case so require. Subpoenas shall be issued for witnesses when
requested by either party or by the Commission. In no instance shall more than
five (5) witnesses be called by each party without consent of the Commission.
11-10  Motions
A.   All motions shall state, with particularity, both relief sought by the
moving party and the basis for granting such relief.
   1.   All motions together with supporting documentation, if any, shall be
served  on the opposing party.
   2.   Motions to dismiss an appeal shall be supported by affidavits, made on
personal knowledge, setting forth facts as would be admissible in evidence.
Affidavits shall show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to
the matter stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all papers referred to
in an affidavit shall be attached thereto. When a motion is made and  supported
as provided in this rule, an adverse party may not rest upon mere allegations
or denials. An adverse party's response, by affidavit or otherwise, shall set
forth specific facts showing there is a genuine issue in dispute.
B.   Procedure motions, not determinative of the final outcome of the appeal,
may be acted upon any time after receipt by the Commission without awaiting a
response from the opposing party. The party adversely affected by such action
of the Commission may move for appropriate relief.
11-11  Record of Hearings
The Commission may record hearings either by the use of a stenographer or
through the use of a magnetic tape or other recording technology.
11-12  Resignation Before Final Action
The acceptance by an appointing authority of the resignation of a person
discharged, before the final action by the Commission, will be considered a
withdrawal of the charges. Notice of such resignation shall be submitted
immediately to the Commission.  The separation of the employee thus resigning
shall be entered upon the records of the Commission and the proceedings
dismissed without judgment.
CHAPTER TWELVE
LAYOFFS
12-01  Layoff Procedures in General
Whenever any permanent office or position in the classified service, except in
the Police Department, is abolished or made unnecessary, or the person holding

TITLE TEN - Judicial
         
Chap. 290.   Mayor's Court.
CHAPTER 290
Mayor's Court
EDITOR'S NOTE: Ohio R. C. 1905.01 provides that the Mayor of Northwood has
jurisdiction to hear and determine any prosecution for the violation of a
Northwood ordinance, and has jurisdiction in all criminal causes involving
moving traffic violations occurring on State highways located within the
corporate limits of Northwood, subject to the limitations of Ohio R. C. 2937.08
and 2938.04. In keeping his docket and file, the Mayor shall be governed by the
laws pertaining to county courts.
Ohio R.C. 2937.08 provides that if the court in which a defendant is charged
with an offense is not a court of record (the Mayor's Court), and the charge is
such that a right to a jury trial exists, such matter shall not be tried before
him unless the accused, by writing subscribed by him, waives a jury and
consents to be tried by the magistrate. If the defendant, in such event, does
not waive his or her right to a jury trial, then the magistrate shall require
the accused to enter into a recognizance to appear before a court of record in
Wood County (the Perrysburg Municipal Court), and the magistrate shall
thereupon certify all papers filed, together with a transcript of proceedings
and accrued costs to date, and such recognizance, if given, to the court of
record. However, Rule 23 (A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal Procedure provides
that in petty offense cases, where there is a right to jury trial, the
defendant shall be tried by the court unless he demands a jury trial. But the
jurisdiction of a Mayor's Court, in such cases, is further limited by Rule 9 of
the Ohio Traffic Rules, which provides that if a jury demand is not made
pursuant to Criminal Rule 23, and the defendant waives his right to jury trial
in writing, a mayor may try the case only if (1) his compensation as a judge is
not directly dependent upon criminal case convictions, or (2) he is not the
chief executive and administrative officer of the municipality and as such
responsible for the financial condition of the municipality. Guilty and no
contest pleas may be taken by any mayor.
Ohio R. C. 1901.24 and 2938.04 provide that the right to trial by jury shall be
claimed by making demand in writing therefor and filing the same with the clerk
of the court of record not less than three days prior to the date set for trial
or on or before the day following receipt of notice of the date set for trial,
whichever is later. However, Rule 23(A) of the Ohio Rules of Criminal
Procedure, which presumptively supersedes Ohio R. C. 2938.04, provides that
right to trial by jury shall be claimed by making demand in writing therefor
and filing the same with the clerk of court not less than ten days prior to the
date set for trial, or on or before the third day following receipt of notice
of the date set for trial, whichever is later. Failure to claim a jury trial as
provided herein is a complete waiver of the right thereto. Ohio R.C. 2938.04
provides, further, that a jury trial may not be had in courts not of record,
but failure to waive a jury in writing where the right to a jury trial may be
asserted shall require the magistrate to certify such case to a court of record
as provided in Ohio R.C. 2937.08.
Ohio R.C. 2945.17 provides that an accused has a right to be tried by a jury at
any trial in any court for the violation of any Ohio statute or of any
Northwood ordinance, except in cases in which the penalty involved does not
exceed a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.00).
The Supreme Court of Ohio, on December 4, 1967, promulgated "Rules of Practice
and Procedure in Traffic Cases For All Courts Inferior to Common Pleas," the
adoption of which became mandatory prior to March 2, 1969. Amended Rules,
referred to as the Ohio Traffic Rules, became effective on January 1, 1975.
   Effective October 20, 1987, Mayors of Mayor's Courts were authorized to
suspend or revoke the operators or chauffeur's license or permit or onresident
operating privilege of any person who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19 or Section
434.01 of the Traffic Code (D ), in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4507.16(B).

of $100.
            2.   In lieu of payment of the additional fine of $100, the
offender instead may elect to attend a distracted driving safety course, the
duration and contents of which shall be established by the Ohio Director of
Public Safety. If the offender attends and successfully completes the course,
the offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of $100, so long as the offender submits to the court both the
offender’s payment in full and such written evidence.
         B.   1.   If the offender appears in person to contest the ticket,
citation, or summons in a trial and the offender pleads guilty to or is
convicted of the violation, the court, in addition to all other penalties
provided by law, may impose the applicable penalty for the violation and may
impose the additional fine of not more than $100.
            2.   If the court imposes upon the offender the applicable penalty
for the violation and an additional fine of not more than $100, the court shall
inform the offender that, in lieu of payment of the additional fine of not more
than $100, the offender instead may elect to attend the distracted driving
safety course described in division (b)(2)A. of this section. If the offender
elects the course option and attends and successfully completes the course, the
offender shall be issued written evidence that the offender successfully
completed the course. The offender shall be required to pay the total amount of
the fine established for the violation, but shall not be required to pay the
additional fine of not more than $100, so long as the offender submits to the
court the offender’s payment and such written evidence.

414.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All state routes are hereby designated as through highways, provided
that stop signs, yield signs, or traffic-control signals shall be erected at
all intersections with such through highways by the Department of
Transportation as to highways under its jurisdiction and by local authorities
as to highways under their jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this
section.  Where two or more state routes that are through highways intersect,
and no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall
be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section. 
Whenever the Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his or her jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this division, he or she shall give notice, in
writing, of that proposed action to the affected local authority at least 30
days before installing or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways, or portions thereof, are hereby designated
as through highways if they are within the Municipality, if they have a
continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of the street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have stop or yield signs or traffic-
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of the street or highway,
or portion thereof, shall be the municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway, or any point on the streets or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided, that in residence
districts, the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic-control devices. 
Where two or more through highways designated under this division intersect and
no traffic-control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be
erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Department or by local
authorities having jurisdiction, except as otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   The Department or local authorities having jurisdiction need not erect
stop signs at intersections they find to be so constructed as to permit traffic
to safely enter a through highway without coming to a stop.  Signs shall be
erected at such intersections indicating that the operator of a vehicle shall
yield the right-of-way to or merge with all traffic proceeding on the through
highway.
   (d)   Local authorities, with reference to highways under their
jurisdiction, may designate additional through highways, and shall erect stop
signs, yield signs, or traffic- control signals at all streets and highways
intersecting such through highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop
or yield intersection, and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to
the intersection.
(ORC 4511.65)
414.03  TRAFFIC CONTROL SIGNAL TERMS AND LIGHTS.
   Highway traffic signal indications for vehicles and pedestrians shall have
the following meanings:
   (a)   Steady Green Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a circular green signal indication
are permitted to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by a lane-use sign, turn
prohibition sign, lane marking, roadway design, separate turn signal
indication, or other traffic control device. Such vehicular traffic, including
vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the
right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn
movement to the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching
from the opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard
during the time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the
intersection.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a green arrow signal indication, displayed
alone or in combination with another signal indication, are permitted to
cautiously enter the intersection only to make the movement indicated by such
arrow, or such other movement as is permitted by other indications displayed at
the same time. Such vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left
or making a u-turn movement, shall yield the right-of-way to both of the
following:
         A.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
         B.   Other traffic lawfully using the intersection.
      (3)   A.   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication,
as provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14, pedestrians facing a circular green signal
indication are permitted to proceed across the roadway within any marked or
unmarked associated crosswalk. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection or so close as to create an immediate
hazard at the time that the green signal indication is first displayed.
         B.   Pedestrians facing a green arrow signal indication, unless
otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or other traffic control
device, shall not cross the roadway.
   (b)   Steady Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular yellow signal indication
are thereby warned that the related green movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated or that a steady red signal indication will
be exhibited immediately thereafter when vehicular traffic shall not enter the
intersection. The provisions governing vehicular operation under the movement
being terminated shall continue to apply while the steady circular yellow
signal indication is displayed.
      (2)   Vehicular traffic facing a steady yellow arrow signal indication is
thereby warned that the related green arrow movement or the related flashing
arrow movement is being terminated. The provisions governing vehicular
operation under the movement being terminated shall continue to apply while the
steady yellow arrow signal indication is displayed.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing a steady circular yellow or yellow arrow signal
indication, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, shall not start
to cross the roadway.
   (c)   Steady Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady circular red signal
indication, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted
by another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, traffic shall stop before entering the crosswalk on the
near side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before
entering the intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication
to proceed is displayed except as provided in divisions (c)(1), (c)(2), and (c)
(3) of this section.
         B.   Except when a traffic control device is in place prohibiting a
turn on red or a steady red arrow signal indication is displayed, vehicular
traffic facing a steady circular red signal indication is permitted, after
stopping, to enter the intersection to turn right, or to turn left from a one-
way street into a one-way street. The right to proceed with the turn shall be
subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a stop
sign.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow signal indication
shall not enter the intersection to make the movement indicated by the arrow
and, unless entering the intersection to make another movement permitted by
another signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop line; but if
there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near side of the
intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, then before entering the
intersection; and shall remain stopped until a signal indication or other
traffic control device permitting the movement indicated by such red arrow is
displayed.
         B.   When a traffic control device is in place permitting a turn on a
steady red arrow signal indication, vehicular traffic facing a steady red arrow
indication is permitted, after stopping, to enter the intersection to turn
right, or to turn left from a one-way street into a one-way street. The right
to proceed with the turn shall be limited to the direction indicated by the
arrow and shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a
stop at a stop sign.
      (3)   Unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication as
provided in Ohio R.C. 4511.14 or other traffic control device, pedestrians
facing a steady circular red or steady red arrow signal indication shall not
enter the roadway.
      (4)   Local authorities by ordinance, or the Director of Transportation
on state highways, may prohibit a right or a left turn against a steady red
signal at any intersection, which shall be effective when signs giving notice
thereof are posted at the intersection.
   (d)   Flashing Green Signal Indication.  A flashing green signal indication
has no meaning and shall not be used.
   (e)   Flashing Yellow Signal Indication.
      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
Ohio R.C. 4511.61 and 4511.62.

Passed 9-22-05; Ord. 2010-16.  Passed 5-13-10.)
418.02  AUTOMATED TRAFFIC ENFORCEMENT SYSTEM.
   (a)   General.
      (1)   The City of Northwood hereby adopts an automated traffic
enforcement system for the purpose of using photographic, video or digital
imaging equipment to record visual images of vehicles entering intersections in
violation of Section
414.01 and/or operating a vehicle in excess of the limits set forth in Section
434.03 and using said images as the basis for issuing “Notice of Liability” to
the vehicle owner or responsible party of such vehicles.
      (2)   The City Streets Department and the Police Department shall be
responsible for implementing the automated traffic enforcement system for both
traffic signal and speed enforcement. These departments are hereby empowered to
designate the intersections and streets to be monitored by automated traffic
enforcement systems; to install, operate and maintain automated traffic
enforcement systems at such designated locations; and to take any and all other
measures necessary for the implementation of the system. The Police Department
shall maintain a list available to the public, of locations so monitored.
      (3)   The intersections chosen for automated traffic enforcement under
this section must display a yellow traffic control signal for a time that
complies with the Ohio Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Traffic
Control Devices.
      (4)   The street locations chosen for automated traffic enforcement under
this section must display a speed limit sign in compliance with the Ohio
Department of Transportation's Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices
Section 2B.11 and Section 2B.15 and Ohio R.C. 4511.21.
   (b)   Notice Requirements.
      (1)   Prior to automated traffic enforcement system implementation, the
Police Department or its designee shall publish notice in a local newspaper of
general circulation. Said notice must announce when the automated traffic
enforcement will begin.
      (2)   The Police Department or its designee shall post a sign in a
conspicuous location that provides notice that an automated traffic enforcement
system is being used to monitor traffic.
      (3)   For the first 30 days that an automated traffic enforcement system
is in operation no “Notices of Liability” may be issued on the basis of the
images produced by the system. Warnings may be issued during that 30 day
period.
   (c)   Offense.
      (1)   An officer employed by the Police Department shall examine the
image recorded by the automated traffic enforcement system to determine whether
an infraction has occurred. If the image recorded by the automated traffic
enforcement system shows an infraction, contains a date and time of the alleged
violation, and shows the letter and numbers on the vehicle's license plate, as
well as the state in which the license was issued, the officer may use any
lawful means to identify the vehicle owner.
      (2)   The fact that a person is registered as the owner of a vehicle with
the vehicle registration office of the state that issued the license plate
displayed on the vehicle shall be prima facie evidence that said person was
operating the vehicle at the time of an infraction recorded by an automated
traffic enforcement system.
      (3)   Within 30 days of the infraction and upon identification of the
registered owner of the vehicle, a Northwood Police Command officer may issue
and send by first-class United States mail a “Notice of Liability” charging the
vehicle owner with an infraction. Said “Notice of Liability” must state the
date on which the “Notice of Liability” was issued, the date, time and location
of the infraction; the time in which a response must be made; and the manner in
which the “Notice of Liability” may be appealed. In addition, a copy of the
image(s) that served as a basis for the “Notice of Liability” must accompany
the “Notice of Liability”.
      (4)   A person who receives such a “Notice of Liability” shall be
required to respond to it by paying a civil penalty as directed on the “Notice
of Liability” within 30 days of its issue date, or by submitting proof of his
or her non-liability as set forth in subsection (c)(5) of this section within
30 days of its issue date, or by submitting, to the address listed on the
“Notice of Liability”, a request for a hearing as set forth in subsection (d)
within 30 days of its issue date.
      (5)   Notwithstanding subsection (c)(2) of this section, the vehicle
owner of the vehicle shall not be liable for a penalty under this section if:
         A.   At the time of the infraction, the vehicle was in the custody of
someone other than the vehicle owner and the vehicle owner submits, to the
address listed on the ticket, substantial and convincing evidence of the
identity of the responsible party at the time of the violation, including, at a
minimum, the responsible party's name and current address.
         B.   At the time of the infraction, the vehicle or the license plate
depicted in the image which served as the basis for the “Notice of Liability”
was stolen and the vehicle owner submits, to the address listed on the ticket,
a copy of the police report stating the vehicle or license plate had been
reported stolen at the time.
      (6)   Nothing in subsection (c)(5) of this section shall be construed as
limiting the liability of an operator of a vehicle for any violation of Section
414.01 or
434.03.
   (d)   Appeal.
      (1)   A person named in a “Notice of Liability” pursuant to this section
may appeal the “Notice of Liability” by making a written request for a hearing
to the address listed on the “Notice of Liability”.
      (2)   Within 45 days of the receipt of the request for a hearing, a
hearing officer appointed by the Police Department or its designee shall hold a
hearing. The hearing officer shall determine whether a preponderance of
evidence establishes that a violation occurred and that the person named in the
“Notice of Liability” is liable for the penalty set forth in subsection (e) of
this section.
      (3)   A certified copy of the “Notice of Liability” alleging the
violation, along with a copy of the image that served as a basis for the
“Notice of Liability”, shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained
therein and shall be admissible in a proceeding alleging a violation under this
chapter.
      (4)   In considering whether the person is liable, the hearing officer
may consider any of the following as an affirmative defense of a violation:
         A.   That the “Notice of Liability” was issued and sent by first-class
mail more than 30 days after the date of the infraction recorded by the
automated traffic enforcement system.
         B.   That the driver of the vehicle passed through the intersection or
had increased speed in order to yield the right-of-way to an emergency vehicle,
in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.45 or to a funeral procession, in accordance
with Ohio R.C. 4511.451.
         C.   That either the vehicle or the license plate depicted on the
image which served as the basis for the “Notice of Liability” was stolen before
the violation occurred and was not in possession of the owner at the time of
the violation, if the vehicle owner submits proof that a police report about
the stolen vehicle or license plate was filed prior to, or within 48 hours
after the violation.
         D.   That this section is unenforceable because the automated traffic
enforcement system was not operating properly, or the automated traffic
enforcement system was not in a proper position, or that the image that served
as the basis for the “Notice of Liability” is not legible enough to show the
letters and numbers or the state that issued the license plate on the vehicle.
         E.   That the driver of the vehicle entered the intersection as part
of a funeral procession or at the direction of a police officer.
         F.   Substantial and convincing evidence that the owner or person
named in the “Notice of Liability” was not operating the vehicle at the time of
the violation. To satisfy the evidentiary burden under this subsection, the
vehicle owner or person named in the “Notice of Liability” shall provide the
hearing officer with substantial and convincing evidence of the responsible
party, including, at a minimum, the responsible party’s name and current
address.
      (5)   The hearing officer shall notify the Police Chief or the Police
Chief’s designee, as well as the person named on the “Notice of Liability”, of
the decision within five days of the hearing. In addition, should the hearing
officer conclude that a preponderance of evidence demonstrates that someone
other than the person named in the “Notice of Liability” was operating the
vehicle at the time of the violation, the hearing officer shall forward to the
Northwood Police Department all evidence provided to him or her as to the
operator's identity.
      (6)   Within ten business days of receiving the evidence referred to in
subsection (d)(5) of this section, the Police Department or its designee may
issue a “Notice of Liability” to the responsible party.
   (e)   Penalties.
      (1)   Unless the vehicle owner or responsible party for a vehicle which
is in violation of Section
414.01 received a citation from a police officer at the time the violation
occurred, the operator shall be subject to a civil penalty equal to the penalty
for said offense if issued through the Northwood Mayor's Court (first offense),
if the vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic enforcement system.
      (2)   Unless the operator of a vehicle that is in violation of Section
434.03 received a citation from a police officer at the time the violation
occurred, the operator shall be subject to a civil penalty equal to the penalty
for said offense if issued through the Northwood Mayor's Court (First offense,
second level), if the vehicle is recorded by an automated traffic enforcement
system.
      (3)   A violation for which a civil penalty is imposed under this section
shall not be considered a moving violation for the purpose of assessing points
under Ohio R.C. 4507.021 and shall not be reported to the Bureau of Motor
Vehicles of any state.
      (4)   The failure to respond to a “Notice of Liability” in a timely
fashion as set forth in subsection (c)(4) of this section shall constitute a
waiver of the right to contest liability for the violation under subsection (c)
of this section.  Said failure shall result in an additional penalty of twenty
five dollars ($25.00).
      (5)   If the penalties set forth in this subsection remain unpaid for
more than 60 days after the date on which the ticket was issued, the penalties
shall be collected, together with any interest and penalties thereon, by civil
suit or other appropriate means of collection.

right-of-way to all vehicles traveling in the proper direction upon the
unobstructed portion of the highway within such distance as to constitute an
immediate hazard;
      (3)   When driving upon a roadway divided into three or more marked lanes
for traffic under the rules applicable thereon;

left side is clearly visible and is free of oncoming traffic for a sufficient
distance ahead to permit the overtaking and passing to be completely made
without interfering with the safe operation of any traffic approaching from the
opposite direction or any traffic overtaken.  In every event, the overtaking
vehicle must return to an authorized lane of travel as soon as practicable, and
in the event the passing movement involves the use of a lane authorized for the
traffic approaching from the opposite direction, before coming within 200 feet

            10.   The person has a concentration of phencyclidine in the
person’s urine of at least 25 nanograms of phencyclidine per milliliter of the
person’s urine or has a concentration of phencyclidine in the person’s whole
blood or blood serum or plasma of at least 10 nanograms of phencyclidine per
milliliter of the person’s whole blood or blood serum or plasma.
            11.   The State Board of Pharmacy has adopted a rule pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 4729.041 that specifies the amount of salvia divinorum and the amount
of salvinorin A that constitute concentrations of salvia divinorum and
salvinorin A in a person’s urine, in a person’s whole blood, or in a person’s
blood serum or plasma at or above which the person is impaired for purposes of
operating any vehicle within this State, the rule is in effect, and the person
has a concentration of salvia divinorum or salvinorin A of at least that amount
so specified by rule in the person’s urine, in the person’s whole blood, or in
the person’s blood serum or plasma.
      (2)   No person who, within 20 years of the conduct described in division
(a)(2)A. of this section, previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to
a violation of this division or a substantially equivalent State law or
municipal ordinance, a violation of division (a)(1) or (b) of this section or a
substantially equivalent State law or municipal ordinance, or any other
equivalent offense shall do both of the following:
         A.   Operate any vehicle within this Municipality while under the
influence of alcohol, a drug of abuse, or a combination of them;
         B.   Subsequent to being arrested for operating the vehicle as
described in division (a)(2)A. of this section, being asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C.
4511.191 or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and being advised
by the officer in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4511.192 or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance of the consequences of the person’s refusal or
submission to the test or tests, refuse to submit to the test or tests.
   (b)   Underage Alcohol Consumption.  No person under 21 years of age shall
operate any vehicle within this Municipality if, at the time of the operation, 
any of the following apply:
      (1)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02% but less than
0.08% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person's whole blood;
      (2)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.03% but less than
0.096% by weight per unit volume of alcohol in the person's blood serum or

      (3)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.02 grams but less than
0.08 grams by weight of alcohol per 210 liters of the person's breath;
      (4)   The person has a concentration of at least 0.028 grams but less
than 0.11 grams by weight of alcohol per 100 milliliters of the person's urine.
   (c)   Prosecution; Limitation on Convictions.  In any proceeding arising out
of one incident, a person may be charged with a violation of division (a)(1)A.
or (a)(2) and a violation of division (b)(1), (2), or (3) of this section, but
the person may not be convicted of more than one violation of these divisions.
   (d)   Evidence; Tests.
      (1)   A.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a)(1)A. of this section or for an equivalent offense
that is vehicle-related, the result of any test of any blood or urine withdrawn
and analyzed at any health care provider, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2317.02, may
be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other relevant and
competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance, or a combination
of them in the defendant's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation.  The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in Ohio R.C. 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of
abuse, or a combination of them as described in this division when a person
submits to a blood test at the request of a law enforcement officer under Ohio
R.C. 4511.191 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or a blood or
urine sample is obtained pursuant to a search warrant. Only a physician, a
registered nurse, an emergency medical technician- intermediate, an emergency
medical technician-paramedic, or a qualified technician, chemist, or
phlebotomist shall withdraw a blood sample for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled substance, or
combination content of the whole blood, blood serum, or blood plasma.  This
limitation does not apply to the taking of breath or urine specimens.  A person
authorized to withdraw blood under this division may refuse to withdraw blood
under this division, if in that person's opinion,  the physical welfare of the
person would be endangered by the withdrawing of blood.  The bodily substance
withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician-intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician- paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis.  If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse, or a qualified technician,
chemist, or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical
test or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer.  If the person was under arrest as
described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person’s own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense.  The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a
person shall not preclude the admission of evidence relating to the chemical
test or tests taken at the request of a law enforcement officer.
      (4)   A.   As used in division (d)(4)B. and C. of this section, “National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration” means the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration established as an administration of the United States
Department of Transportation under 96 Stat. 2415 (1983), 49 U.S.C. 105.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a
violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, of a municipal ordinance
relating to operating a vehicle while under the influence of alcohol, a drug of
abuse, or alcohol and a drug of abuse, or of a municipal ordinance relating to
operating a vehicle with a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine, if a law enforcement officer has
administered a field sobriety test to the operator of the vehicle involved in
the violation and if it is shown by clear and convincing evidence that the
officer administered the test in substantial compliance with the testing
standards for any reliable, credible, and generally accepted field sobriety
tests that were in effect at the time the tests were administered, including,
but not limited to, any testing standards then in effect that were set by the
National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, all of the following apply:
            1.   The officer may testify concerning the results of the field
sobriety test so administered.
            2.   The prosecution may introduce the results of the field
sobriety test so administered as evidence in any proceedings in the criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding.
            3.   If testimony is presented or evidence is introduced under
division (d)(4)B.1. or 2. of this section and if the testimony or evidence is
admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the testimony or
evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the trier of fact
considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,
(a)(1)C., (a)(1)D., (a)(1)E., (a)(1)F., (a)(1)G., (a)(1)H., (a)(1)I. or (a)
(1)J. or (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(3), or (b)(4) of this section or for an equivalent
offense that is substantially equivalent to any of those divisions, a
laboratory report from any laboratory personnel issued a permit by the
Department of Health authorizing an analysis as described in this division that
contains an analysis of the whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine,
or other bodily substance tested and that contains all of the information
specified in this division shall be admitted as prima facie evidence of the
information and statements that the report contains.  The laboratory report
shall contain all of the following:
         A.   The signature, under oath, of any person who performed the
analysis;
         B.   Any findings as to the identity and quantity of alcohol, a drug
of abuse, a controlled substance, a metabolite of a controlled substance, or a
combination of them that was found;
         C.   A copy of a notarized statement by the laboratory director of a
designee of the director that contains the name of each certified analyst or
test performer involved with the report, the analyst's or test performer's
employment relationship with the laboratory that issued the report, and a
notation that performing an analysis of the type involved is part of the
analyst's or test performer's regular duties;
         D.   An outline of the analyst's or test performer's education,
training, and experience in performing the type of analysis involved and a
certification that the laboratory satisfies appropriate quality control
standards in general and, in this particular analysis, under rules of the
Department of Health.
      (2)   Notwithstanding any other provision of law regarding the admission
of evidence, a report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
is not admissible against the defendant to whom it pertains in any proceeding,
other than a preliminary hearing or a grand jury proceeding, unless the
prosecutor has served a copy of the report on the defendant's attorney or, if
the defendant has no attorney, on the defendant.
      (3)   A report of the type described in division (e)(1) of this section
shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents, identity, or amount of any
substance if, within seven days after the defendant to whom the report pertains
or the defendant's attorney receives a copy of the report, the defendant or the
defendant's attorney demands the testimony of the person who signed the report.
The judge in the case may extend the seven-day time limit in the interest of
justice.
   (f)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, any physician,
registered nurse, or qualified technician, chemist, or phlebotomist who
withdraws blood from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, and any hospital, first-aid station, or clinic at which
blood is withdrawn from a person pursuant to this section or Ohio R.C. 4511.19,
4511.191 or 4511.192, is immune from criminal liability and civil liability
based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(ORC 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definition.  For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   “Alcohol monitoring device.” Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person’s system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person’s conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests.  Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this Municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   The chemical test or tests under division (g)(2) of this section
shall be administered at the request of a law enforcement officer having
reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating or in physical control
of a vehicle in violation of a division, section, or ordinance identified in
division (g)(2) of this section.  The law enforcement agency by which the
officer is employed shall designate which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness.  Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who  otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to Ohio R.C.
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if
convicted would be required to be sentenced under Ohio R.C. 4511.19(G)(1)(c),
(G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to
submit, and the person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the
person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose
of determining the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of
a controlled substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a
request pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or
tests is not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting
to, or refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the
person the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer
shall advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to
take a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are
necessary to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person
at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test
taken at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section
apply to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this
division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person’s whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person’s
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(ORC 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal OVI
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer's reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. 
The person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request
of the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two- hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance, or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
   “You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under State
law or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
   “If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated.  If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
State or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for State O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the State O.V.I.
   (Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
   If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense.”
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a chemical test or tests
under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this section, the arresting officer shall seize the
Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of the
person and immediately forward it to the court in which the arrested person is
to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is not in possession of the
person's license or permit or it is not in the person's vehicle, the officer
shall order the person to surrender it to the law enforcement agency that
employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest, and, upon the surrender,
the agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the court in
which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon receipt of the license or
permit, the court shall retain it pending the arrested person's initial
appearance and any action taken under Ohio R.C. 4511.196.
      (9)   A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under Ohio R.C. 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division(o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal OVI ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of Ohio R.C.
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A) or (B), Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, or a municipal OVI ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or
tests and the test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time of the alleged
offense.
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division(o) of this section, Ohio R.C. 4511.194
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law
enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test or tests under this section,
and who submits to the test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a
controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test
results indicate is present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest provided the
report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is sworn
to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48 hours
after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy of the
sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on the
charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under Ohio R.C.
4511.197 relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from
the arrest covered by the report.
(ORC 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately.  A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in Ohio R.C. 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person.  Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance.  If a person arrested for operating a vehicle

each approach direction;
            3.   The distance encompassed by the special marking of the
pavement for a principal school pupil crosswalk plus a distance of 300 feet on
each approach direction of the highway.
         D.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the

section, if a person is issued a probationary driver’s license prior to
attaining the age of 17 years and the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed a moving violation
during the six-month period commencing on the date on which the person is
issued the probationary driver’s license, the holder must be accompanied by the
holder’s parent or guardian whenever the holder is operating a motor vehicle
upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking during whichever of the following time
periods applies:
            1.   If, on the date the holder of the probationary driver’s
license pleads guilty to, is convicted of, or is adjudicated in juvenile court
of having committed the moving violation, the holder has not attained the age
of 16.5 years, during the six-month period commencing on that date;
            2.   If, on the date the holder pleads guilty to, is convicted of,
or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having committed the moving violation,
the holder has attained the age of 16.5 years but not 17 years, until the
person attains the age of 17 years.
         B.   If the holder of a probationary driver’s license commits a moving
violation during the six-month period after the person is issued the
probationary driver’s license and before the person attains the age of 17 years
and on the date the person pleads guilty to, is convicted of, or is adjudicated
in juvenile court of having committed the moving violation the person has
attained the age of 17 years, or if the person commits the moving violation
during the six-month period after the person is issued the probationary

      (2)   Any person who is subject to the operating restrictions established
under division (c)(1) of this section as a result of a first moving violation
may petition the court for occupational or educational driving privileges
without being accompanied by the holder’s parent or guardian during the period
of time specified in that division. The court may grant the person such driving
privileges if the court finds reasonable cause to believe that the restrictions
established in division (c)(1) will seriously affect the person’s ability to
continue in employment or educational training or will cause undue hardship on
the license holder or a family member of the license holder. In granting the
driving privileges, the court shall specify the purposes, times and places of
the privileges and shall issue the person appropriate forms setting forth the
privileges granted. Occupational or educational driving privileges under this
division shall not be granted to the same person more than once. If a person is
convicted of, pleads guilty to or is adjudicated in juvenile court of having
committed a second or subsequent moving violation, any driving privileges
previously granted under this division are terminated upon the subsequent
conviction, plea or adjudication.
      (3)   No person shall violate division (c)(1)A. of this section.
   (d)   No holder of a probationary license shall operate a motor vehicle upon

of age under proof of hardship satisfactory to the Registrar of Motor Vehicles.
   (f)   This section does not apply to motor vehicle rental dealers or motor
vehicle leasing dealers, as defined in Ohio R.C. 4549.65.
   (g)   Evidence of a conviction of, plea of guilty to, or adjudication as a
delinquent child for a violation of this section shall not be admissible as
evidence in any civil action that involves the offender or delinquent child who
is the subject of the conviction, plea, or adjudication and that arises from
the wrongful entrustment of a motor vehicle.
   (h)   For purposes of this section, a vehicle is owned by a person if, at
the time of a violation of this section, the vehicle is registered in the
person's name.
(ORC 4511.203)
436.06  DISPLAY OF LICENSE.
   (a)   The operator of a motor vehicle shall display the operator's driver's
license, or furnish satisfactory proof that the operator has a driver's
license, upon demand of any peace officer or of any person damaged or injured
in any collision in which the licensee may be involved.  When a demand is
properly made, and the operator has the operator's driver's license on or about
the operator's person, the operator shall not refuse to display the license.  A
person's failure to furnish satisfactory evidence that the person is licensed
under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 when the person does not have the person's license
on or about the person's person shall be prima facie evidence of the person's
not having obtained a driver's license.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, whoever
violates this section is guilty of an unclassified misdemeanor. When the
offense is an unclassified misdemeanor, the offender shall be sentenced

sentenced to a jail term; the offender shall not be sentenced to a community
residential sanction pursuant to Section
698.02(d) or Ohio R.C. 2929.26; notwithstanding Section
698.02(f)(1)B.1. and Ohio R.C. 2929.28(A)(2)(a), the offender may be fined up
to one thousand dollars ($1,000); and notwithstanding Section
698.02(e)(1)C. and Ohio R.C. 2929.27(A)(3), the offender may be ordered
pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up

service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.

evidence as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under
suspension at the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(1) of this
section or the person operated a motor vehicle in violation of a restriction at
the time of the alleged violation of division (a)(2) of this section. The
person charged with a violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section

R.C. 4510.02(A)(7).
         B.   1.   Except as provided in division (a)(4)B.2. or (a)(4)B.3. of
this section, the court, in addition to any other penalty that it imposes on
the offender and if the vehicle is registered in the offender’s name and if,
within three years of the offense, the offender previously has been convicted

applicable. The court shall not release a vehicle from immobilization ordered
under this section unless the court is presented with current proof of
financial responsibility with respect to that vehicle.
      (6)   Any order of criminal forfeiture under this section shall be issued
and enforced under Ohio R.C. 4503.234. Upon receipt of the copy of the order
from the court, neither the Registrar of Motor Vehicles nor a deputy registrar
shall accept any application for the registration or transfer of registration
of any motor vehicle owned or leased by the person named in the declaration of
forfeiture. The period of registration denial shall be five years after the
date of the order, unless, during that period, the court having jurisdiction of
the offense that led to the order terminates the forfeiture and notifies the
registrar of the termination. The registrar then shall take necessary measures
to permit the person to register a vehicle owned or leased by the person or to
transfer registration of the vehicle.
      (7)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to
provide that proof of financial responsibility, then, in addition to any other
penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Section

noncertified copy of the law enforcement automated data system report or a
noncertified copy of a record of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles that shows the

violation of division (b)(1) of this section may be admitted into evidence as
prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under suspension at the
time of the alleged violation of division (b)(1) of this section. The person
charged with a violation of division (b)(1) of this section may offer evidence
to rebut this prima facie evidence.
      (3)   Whoever violates division (b)(1) of this section is guilty of

under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.
         B.   If, within three years of the offense, the offender previously
was convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of division (b)(1)
of this section, or any combination of two or more violations of division (b)
(1) of this section, R.C. § 4510.11, 4510.111 or 4510.16, or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is a misdemeanor of the fourth
degree, and the offender shall provide the court with proof of financial

noncertified copy of a record of the registrar of motor vehicles that shows the
name, date of birth, and Social Security number of a person charged with a
violation of division (a)(1) or (a)(2) of this section may be admitted into

driver’s or commercial driver’s license at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a)(1) of this section or a valid license as a motorcycle operator
either in the form of an endorsement upon a driver’s or commercial driver’s

pursuant to Section
698.02(e)(3) or Ohio R.C. 2929.27(C) to serve a term of community service of up
to 500 hours. The failure of an offender to complete a term of community
service imposed by the court may be punished as indirect criminal contempt
under Ohio R.C. 2705.02(A) that may be filed in the underlying case.  If the
offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded guilty to any violation of
this section or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the offense is
a misdemeanor of the first degree.
      (2)   If the offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license or permit
or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section

a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance within the past three years, and
if the offender's license was expired for more than six months at the time of
the offense, the court may impose a class seven suspension of the offender's
driver license, commercial driver's license, temporary instruction permit,
probationary license, or nonresident operating privilege from the range

term shall be imposed, unless, subject to division (c) of this section, the
court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 30 consecutive days of house
arrest with electronic monitoring. A period of house arrest with electronic

plates of that vehicle. The order for immobilization and impoundment shall be
issued and enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.233.
      (2)   If, within six years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to one violation of this section or one
equivalent offense, driving under OVI suspension is a misdemeanor of the first
degree. The court shall sentence the offender to all of the following:
         A.   A mandatory jail term of 10 consecutive days. Notwithstanding the
jail terms provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence the
offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The 10-day mandatory
jail term shall be imposed unless, subject to division (c) of this section, the
court instead imposes a sentence of not less than 90 consecutive days of house
arrest with electronic monitoring. The period of house arrest with electronic
monitoring shall not exceed one year;

jail terms provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.21 to 2929.28, the court may sentence the
offender to a longer jail term of not more than one year. The court shall not
sentence the offender to a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring in
lieu of the mandatory portion of the jail term;
         B.   Notwithstanding the fines set forth in Ohio R.C. Chapter 2929, a
fine of not less than five hundred dollars ($500.00) and not more than two
thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00);
         C.   A license suspension under division (e) of this section;
         D.   If the vehicle the offender was operating at the time of the
offense is registered in the offender's name, criminal forfeiture to the state
of the offender's vehicle. The order of criminal forfeiture shall be issued and
enforced in accordance with Ohio R.C. 4503.234. If title to a motor vehicle
that is subject to an order for criminal forfeiture under this division is
assigned or transferred and Ohio R.C. 4503.234(B)(2) or (3) applies, the court
may fine the offender the value of the vehicle as determined by publications of
the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds from any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division Ohio R.C. 4503.234(C)
(2).
   (c)   (1)   No court shall impose an alternative sentence of house arrest
with electronic monitoring under division (b)(1) or (2) of this section unless,
within 60 days of the date of sentencing, the court issues a written finding on
the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail where the
offender is required to serve the jail term imposed, the offender will not be
able to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing.
      (2)   An offender sentenced under this section to a period of house
arrest with electronic monitoring shall be permitted work release during that

or ordinance, the trial judge of any court of record or the mayor of a mayor's
court shall impose on an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of this section a class seven suspension of the offender's driver's
or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privilege
from the range specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.02 (A)(7). 
      (1)   When permitted as specified in Ohio R.C. 4510.021, if the court
grants limited driving privileges during a suspension imposed under this
section, the privileges shall be granted on the additional condition that the
offender must display restricted license plates, issued under Ohio R.C.
4503.231, on the vehicle driven subject to the privileges, except as provided
in Ohio R.C. 4503.231(B).
      (2)   A suspension of a commercial driver's license under this section
shall be concurrent with any period of suspension or disqualification under
Ohio R.C. 3123.58 or 4506.16. No person who is disqualified for life from
holding a commercial driver's license under Ohio R.C. 4506.16 shall be issued a
driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period for which the
commercial driver's license was suspended under this section, and no person
whose commercial driver's license is suspended under this section shall be
issued a driver's license under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4507 during the period of the
suspension.
   (f)   The offender shall provide the court with proof of financial
responsibility as defined in Ohio R.C. 4509.01. If the offender fails to

penalties provided by law, the court may order restitution pursuant to Section
698.02(f) or Ohio R.C. 2929.28 in an amount not exceeding five thousand dollars
($5,000) for any economic loss arising from an accident or collision that was
the direct and proximate result of the offender’s operation of the vehicle
before, during, or after committing the offense that is a misdemeanor of the
first degree under this section for which the offender is sentenced.

as prima facie evidence that the license of the person was under either a
financial responsibility law suspension at the time of the alleged violation of
division (a) of this section or a nonpayment of judgment suspension at the time

offender to respond to a financial responsibility random verification request
under Ohio R.C. 4509.101(A)(3)(c) and that, at the time of the initial
financial responsibility random verification request, the alleged offender was
in compliance with Ohio R.C. 4509.101(A)(1) as shown by proof of financial

elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device in violation of
division (b)(2) of this section shall not be considered or used by the trier of
fact in a tort action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.
But, the trier of fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with
the Ohio Rules of Evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in
the tort action and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that
represents non-economic loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011, in a tort
action that could have been recovered but for the plaintiff’s failure to wear
all of the available elements of a properly adjusted occupant restraining
device. Evidence of that failure shall not be used as a basis for a criminal
prosecution of the person other than a prosecution for a violation of this
section; and shall not be admissible as evidence in a criminal action involving

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent
that the claim for relief satisfies all of the following:

   (a)   In General.  No trackless trolley, traction engine, steam roller or
other vehicle, load, object or structure, whether propelled by muscular or
motor power, not including vehicles run upon stationary rails or tracks, fire
engines, fire trucks or other vehicles or apparatus belonging to or used by any
municipal or volunteer fire department in the discharge of its functions, shall
be operated or moved over or upon the improved public streets, highways,
bridges or culverts in the City, upon wheels, rollers or otherwise, weighing in
excess of the weights prescribed in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.14, inclusive, or
of weights prescribed in this chapter, including the weight of the vehicle,
object, structure or contrivance and load, except upon special permission
granted as provided by Ohio R.C. 4513.34 or by Section
440.12 of this chapter. 
(ORC 5577.02; Ord. 89-55.  Passed 10-12-89.)
   (b)   State Regulations.
      (1)   A.   The Municipality, with respect to highways under their
jurisdiction, upon application in writing, shall issue a special regional heavy
hauling permit authorizing the applicant to operate or move a vehicle or
combination of vehicles as follows:
            1.   At a size or weight of vehicle or load exceeding the maximum
specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 to 5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with
Ohio R.C. 4513.01 to 4513.37.
            2.   Upon any highway under the jurisdiction of municipality except
those highways with a condition insufficient to bear the weight of the vehicle
or combination of vehicles as stated in the application.
            3.   For regional trips at distances of 150 miles or less from a
facility stated on the application as the applicant’s point of origin.
            4.   Issuance of a special regional heavy hauling permit is subject
to the payment of a fee established by the municipality in accordance with this
section.
         B.   In circumstances where a person is not eligible to receive a
permit under division (b)(1)A. of this section, the Municipality, with respect
to highways under its jurisdiction, upon application in writing and for good
cause shown, may issue a special permit in writing authorizing the applicant to
operate or move a vehicle or combination of vehicles of a size or weight of
vehicle or load exceeding the maximum specified in Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through
5577.09, or otherwise not in conformity with Ohio R.C. 4513.01 through 4513.37,
upon any highway under its jurisdiction.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 715.22 and 723.01, the holder of a permit
issued by the Director of Transportation under Ohio R.C. 4513.34 may move the
vehicle or combination of vehicles described in the permit on any highway that
is a part of the State highway system when the movement is partly within and
partly without the corporate limits of the Municipality.  No local authority
shall require any other permit or license or charge any license fee or other
charge against the holder of a permit for the movement of a vehicle or
combination of vehicles on any highway which is a part of the State highway
system.  The Ohio Director of Transportation shall not require the holder of a
permit issued by the Municipality to obtain a special permit for the movement
of vehicles or combination of vehicles on highways within the jurisdiction of
the Municipality.  Permits may be issued for any period of time not to exceed
one year, as the local authority in its discretion determines advisable or for
the duration of any public construction project.
      (3)   A.   The application for a permit issued under this section shall
be in the form that the Municipality prescribes. The Municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued.  The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the Municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles. 
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed
a nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under Ohio R.C. 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a
vehicle, are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules
establishing requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially
similar to the requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:
2-1.
      (4)   The Municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (b)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the Municipality may issue or withhold a permit
specified in division (b)(1)B. of this section.  If a permit is to be issued,
the Municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the vehicle
and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned upon the
sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the roadway or
a street or highway structure.  In addition, the Municipality, as a condition
of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to develop and
enter into a mutual agreement with the Municipality to compensate for or to
repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit.  No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in Ohio R.C.
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in Ohio
R.C. 4513.34(G).
      (8)   A.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under
this section that relate to gross load limits.
         B.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to axle load by more than 2,000 pounds per axle or group of
axles.
         C.   No person shall violate the terms of a permit issued under this
section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the Municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.
(ORC 4513.34)
   (c)   Whoever violates division (b) of this section is guilty of a minor
misdemeanor.
(ORC 4513.99)
   (d)   Local Streets Generally. 
      (1)   Except as otherwise provided by Council by ordinances establishing
more restrictive limits, no person shall operate a vehicle exceeding a size as
specified in this chapter or exceeding a gross weight of three tons, upon any
street in the Municipality other than State routes, except those local streets
designated as truck routes and marked as such by appropriate traffic signs, and
except when such operation is necessary to load or unload property, to go to or
from the usual place of storage of such vehicle or to perform any other
legitimate business or act other than passage through the Municipality. The
total weight of the vehicle and load imposed upon the road surface for such
designated truck routes shall not exceed 80,000 pounds. Operators of vehicles
so deviating from either a State route or a designated truck route within the
Municipality shall confine such deviation to that required in order to
accomplish the purpose of the departure.
      (2)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, local streets and
highways shall be posted with signs indicating “No Thru Trucks - Gross Weight 3
Tons,” or words of similar import, to apprise drivers of the limitations
imposed by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on
any such sign.
(Ord. 89-55. Passed 10-12-89.)

440.011  WEIGHT OF LOAD; WIDTH OF TIRE.
   (a)   No person shall transport over the improved public streets, alleys,
intercounty highways, State highways, bridges or culverts, in any vehicle
propelled by muscular, motor or other power, any burden, including weight of
vehicle and load, greater than the following:
      (1)   In vehicles having metal tires three inches or less in width, a
load of 500 pounds for each inch of total width of tire on all wheels; when the
tires on such vehicles exceed three inches in width, an additional load of 800
pounds shall be permitted for each inch by which the total width of the tires
on all wheels exceeds twelve inches.
      (2)   In vehicles having tires of rubber or other similar substances, for
each inch of the total width of tires on all wheels, as follows:
         A.   For tires three inches in width, a load of 450 pounds;
         B.   For tires three and one half inches in width, a load of 450
pounds;
         C.   For tires four inches in width, a load of 500 pounds;
         D.   For tires five inches in width, a load of 600 pounds; and
         E.   For tires six inches and over in width, a load of 650 pounds.
   (b)   The total width of tires on all wheels shall be, in the case of solid
tires of rubber or other similar substance, the actual width in inches of all
such tires between the flanges at the base of the tires, but in no event shall
that portion of the tire coming in contact with the road surface be less than
two-thirds the width so measured between the flanges.
   (c)   In the case of pneumatic tires of rubber or other similar substance,
the total width of tires on all wheels shall be the actual width of all such
tires, measured at the widest portion thereof when inflated and not bearing a
load.
   (d)   In no event shall the load, including the proportionate weight of the
vehicle that can be concentrated on any wheel, exceed 650 pounds to each inch
in width of the tread, as defined in this section for solid tires, or each inch
in the actual diameter of pneumatic tires measured when inflated and not
bearing a load.
(ORC 5577.03; Ord. 89-56. Passed 10-12-89.)
440.012  MAXIMUM AXLE LOAD, WHEEL LOAD, GROSS WEIGHTS AND TOWING CONNECTION
LENGTH FOR PNEUMATIC TIRES.
   (a)   The maximum wheel load of any one wheel of any vehicle, load, object
or structure operated or moved upon improved public highways, streets, bridges
or culverts shall not exceed 650 pounds per inch width of pneumatic tire,
measured as prescribed by Section
440.10 and Ohio R.C. 5577.03.
   (b)   The weight of vehicle and load imposed upon a road surface that is
part of the interstate system by vehicles with pneumatic tires shall not exceed
any of the following weight limitations:
      (1)   On any one axle, 20,000 pounds;
      (2)   On any tandem axle, 34,000 pounds;
      (3)   On any two or more consecutive axles, the maximum weight as
determined by application of the formula provided in division (c) of this
section.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of division (b)(3) of this section, the maximum
gross weight on any two or more consecutive axles shall be determined by
application of the following formula:
   W = 500((LN/N-1) + 12N + 36)
      (2)   In this formula, W equals the overall gross weight on any group of
two or more consecutive axles to the nearest 500 pounds, L equals the distance
in rounded whole feet between the extreme of any group of two or more
consecutive axles, and N equals the number of axles in the group under
consideration.  However, two consecutive sets of tandem axles may carry a gross
load of 34,000 pounds each, provided the overall distance between the first and
last axles of such consecutive sets of tandem axles is thirty-six feet or more.
   (d)   Except as provided in division (B)(9) of this section, the weight of
vehicle and load imposed upon a road surface that is not part of the interstate
system by vehicles with pneumatic tires shall not exceed any of the following
weight limitations:

440.10  WEIGHING VEHICLE; SCALES TO BE USED; REMOVAL OF EXCESS LOAD; ALTERATION
OF WEIGHT LIMITS BY LOCAL AUTHORITIES.
   (a)   Any police officer having reason to believe that the weight of a
vehicle and its load is unlawful may require the driver of the vehicle to stop
and submit to a weighing of it by means of a compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scale specially adapted to determine the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways; a sealed scale permanently installed in a fixed location, having a
load-receiving element specially adapted to determine the wheel loads of
highway vehicles; a sealed scale, permanently installed in a fixed location,
having a load-receiving element specially adapted to determine the combined
load of all wheels on a single axle or on successive axles of a highway
vehicle; or a sealed scale adapted to weighing highway vehicles, loaded or
unloaded. The driver of the vehicle shall, if necessary, be directed to proceed
to the nearest available sealed scales to accomplish the weighing, provided the
scales are within three miles of the point where the vehicle is stopped. Any
vehicle stopped in accordance with this section may be held by the police
officer for a reasonable time only to accomplish the weighing as prescribed by
this section. All scales used in determining the lawful weight of a vehicle and
its load shall be annually compared by a Municipal, County or State sealer with
the State standards or standards approved by the State, and the scales shall
not be sealed if they do not conform to the State standards or standards
approved by the State.
   (b)   At each end of a permanently installed scale there shall be a straight
approach in the same plane as the platform, of sufficient length and width to
ensure the level positioning of vehicles during weight determinations.
   (c)   During determination of weight by compact, self-contained, portable,
sealed scales, specially adapted to determine the wheel loads of vehicles on
highways, they shall always be used on terrain of sufficient length and width
to accommodate the entire vehicle being weighed. The terrain shall be level or,
if not level, it shall be of such elevation that the difference in elevation
between the wheels on any one axle does not exceed two inches and the
difference in elevation between axles being weighed does not exceed one-quarter
inch per foot of the distance between the axles.
   (d)   In all determinations of all weights, except gross weight, by compact,
self- contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determine the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all successive axles, twelve feet or less
apart, shall be weighed simultaneously by placing one scale under the outside
wheel of each axle. In determination of gross weight by the use of compact,
self-contained, portable, sealed scales, specially adapted to determine the
wheel loads of vehicles on highways, all axles shall be weighed simultaneously
by placing one scale under the outside wheel of each axle.
   (e)   Whenever the officer, upon weighing a vehicle and load, determines
that the weight is unlawful, he may require the driver to stop the vehicle in a
suitable place and remain standing until such portion of the load is removed as
is necessary to reduce the weight of the vehicle to the limit permitted under
Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.14.
   (f)   Whenever local authorities determine upon the basis of an engineering
and traffic investigation that the weight limits permitted under local
ordinance, or under Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.14, or the weight limits
permitted when compact, self- contained, portable, sealed scales, specially
adapted to determine the wheel loads of vehicles on highways, used on any part
of a State route under their jurisdiction, are greater than is reasonable under
the conditions found to exist at the location, the local authorities may, by
resolution, request the Ohio Director of Transportation to determine and
declare reasonable weight limits. Upon receipt of the request the Director may
determine and declare reasonable weight limits at the location, and if the
Director alters the weight limits set by Ohio R.C. 5577.01 through 5577.14;
then the altered weight limits shall become effective only when appropriate
signs giving notice thereof are erected at the location by local authorities.
   (g)   The Director may withdraw his approval of any altered weight limit
whenever, in his opinion, any altered weight limit becomes unreasonable, and
upon the withdrawal the altered weight limit shall become ineffective and the
signs relating thereto shall be immediately removed by the local authorities.
Alteration of weight limits on State routes by the local authorities is not
effective until alteration has been approved by the Director.

conferred upon the Director or boards of county commissioners by Ohio R.C.
5577.07.

   (a)   The County Sheriff or Chief of Police, within the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
respective territorial jurisdiction, or a state highway patrol trooper, upon
notification to the Sheriff or Chief of Police of such action and of the
location of the place of storage, may order into storage any motor vehicle,
including an abandoned junk motor vehicle as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, that:
      (1)   Has come into the possession of the Sheriff, Chief of Police, or
state highway patrol trooper as a result of the performance of the Sheriff’s,
Chief’s, or trooper’s duties; or
      (2)   Has been left on a public street or other property open to the
public for purposes of vehicular travel, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway, for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Sheriff
or Chief of Police of the reasons for leaving the motor vehicle in such place.
However, when such a motor vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic it may
be ordered into storage immediately unless either of the following applies:
         A.   The vehicle was involved in an accident and is subject to R.C. §
4513.66, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;

Chief of Police, or state highway patrol trooper shall order the removal of the
vehicle.
      (3)   Subject to division (c) of this section, the Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall designate the place of storage of any motor vehicle so ordered

or Chief of Police, or by a state highway patrol trooper within five business
days of the removal of the vehicle. Upon obtaining such identity, the Sheriff
or Chief of Police shall send or cause to be sent to the owner or lienholder at
the owner’s or lienholder’s last known address by certified mail with return
receipt requested, notice that informs the owner or lienholder that the motor
vehicle will be declared a nuisance and disposed of if not claimed within ten
days of the date of mailing of the notice.
      (2)   A.   The owner or lienholder of the motor vehicle may reclaim the
motor vehicle upon payment of any expenses or charges incurred in its removal

storage facility may charge an after-hours retrieval fee established by the
Public Utilities Commission in rules adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25 if the
owner retrieves the personal items after hours, unless the towing service or
storage facility fails to provide the notice required under Ohio R.C. 4513.69
(B)(3), if applicable. However, the owner shall not do either of the following:
            1.   Retrieve any personal item that has been determined by the
Sheriff, Chief of Police, or a state highway patrol trooper, as applicable, to
be necessary to a criminal investigation;

search of the records of the Bureau of Motor Vehicles has been conducted and
after notice has been sent to the owner or lienholder as described in this
section, and the search was conducted by the place of storage, and the notice
was sent to the motor vehicle owner by the place of storage, the owner or
lienholder shall pay to the place of storage a processing fee of twenty-five
dollars ($25.00), in addition to any expenses or charges incurred in the
removal and storage of the vehicle.
   (d)   If the owner or lienholder makes no claim to the motor vehicle within
ten days of the date of mailing of the notice, and if the vehicle is to be
disposed of at public auction as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police,
without charge to any party, shall file with the Clerk of Courts of the county
in which the place of storage is located an affidavit showing compliance with
the requirements of this section. Upon presentation of the affidavit, the
Clerk, without charge, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and
clear of all liens and encumbrances, to the Sheriff or Chief of Police. If the
vehicle is to be disposed of to a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other
facility as provided in R.C. § 4513.62 or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the Sheriff or Chief of Police shall execute in triplicate
an affidavit, as prescribed by the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, describing the
motor vehicle and the manner in which it was disposed of, and that all
requirements of this section have been complied with. The Sheriff or Chief of
Police shall retain the original of the affidavit for the Sheriff’s or Chief’s
records, and shall furnish two copies to the motor vehicle salvage dealer or
other facility. Upon presentation of a copy of the affidavit by the motor
vehicle salvage dealer, the Clerk of Courts, within 30 days of the
presentation, shall issue a salvage certificate of title, free and clear of all
liens and encumbrances.
   (e)   Whenever a motor vehicle salvage dealer or other facility receives an
affidavit for the disposal of a motor vehicle as provided in this section, the
dealer or facility shall not be required to obtain an Ohio certificate of title
to the motor vehicle in the dealer’s or facility’s own name if the vehicle is
dismantled or destroyed and both copies of the affidavit are delivered to the
Clerk of Courts.
   (f)   No towing service or storage facility shall fail to comply with this
section.
(R.C. § 4513.61)
   (g)   Abandonment of Junk Motor Vehicle Prohibited.
      (1)   A.   No person shall willfully leave an abandoned junk motor
vehicle, as defined in R.C. § 4513.63, on private property for more than 72

of the property, or on a public street or other property open to the public for
purposes of vehicular travel or parking, or upon or within the right-of-way of
any road or highway for 48 hours or longer without notification to the Police
Chief of the reason for leaving the motor vehicle in that place.
         B.   For purposes of this division (g)(1), the fact that a motor
vehicle has been so left without permission or notification is prima facie
evidence of abandonment.
         C.   Nothing contained in this section and R.C. §§ 4513.60, 4513.61
and 4513.63 shall invalidate or prevent the enactment of further provisions of
municipal ordinances regulating or prohibiting the abandonment of motor
vehicles on streets, highways, public property or private property within the
municipality.
      (2)   Whoever violates this division (g) is guilty of a minor misdemeanor
and shall also be assessed any costs incurred by the municipality in disposing
of the abandoned junk motor vehicle, less any money accruing to the
municipality from the disposal.

adopted under Ohio R.C. 4921.25, in order to obtain release of the motor
vehicle. However, if the vehicle is within a municipal corporation and the
municipal corporation has established a vehicle removal fee, the towing service
shall give the owner or operator oral or written notification that the owner or
operator may pay not more than one- half of that fee to obtain release of the
motor vehicle. That fee may be paid by use of a major credit card unless the

606.02  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or, when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature. A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for that element. When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for that element. When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for that
element.
(R.C. § 2901.22)
606.03  CLASSIFICATION OF OFFENSES.

boundaries and the air space above that land and water, with respect to which
this Municipality has either exclusive or concurrent legislative jurisdiction. 
Where the boundary between this Municipality and another jurisdiction is

shall be commenced within five years after discovery of the offense either by
an aggrieved person or the aggrieved person’s legal representative who is not a

   (c)   (1)   If the period of limitation provided in division (a)(1) or (a)

      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of Ohio
R.C. 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43
(A) or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense
involving misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any
municipal ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code
sections listed in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03
is determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and
if the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is
committed, prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be
commenced within five years after the determination is complete.
      (2)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal investigation
of the commission of a violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 is determined
to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time
of the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs.  In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until such course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation, or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first.  A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same.  A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation, or other process unless reasonable diligence
is exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution.  Proof that the accused departed this
Municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this State, even
though the indictment, information, or process that commenced the prosecution
is quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information, or process are
set aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   The period of limitation for a violation of this Part 6 or Title XXIX
of the Ohio Revised Code that involves a physical or mental wound, injury,
disability, or condition of a nature that reasonably indicates abuse or neglect
of a child under 18 years of age or of a child with a development disability or
physical impairment under 21 years of age shall not begin to run until either
of the following occurs:
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected, or believed to
have occurred.
   (k)   As used in this section, “peace officer” has the same meaning as in
Ohio R.C. 2935.01.
   (l)   The amendments to divisions (a) and (d) of this section apply to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015,
and apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July
16, 2015, if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section
as it existed on July 15, 2015.
(ORC 2901.13)
606.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY; VOLUNTARY INTOXICATION.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, a person is not
guilty of an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person’s liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   As used in this section:
      (1)   “Culpability.”  Purpose, knowledge, recklessness, or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.”  Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.”  Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are involuntary acts.
      (4)   “Possession.”  A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
606.08  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent,
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer,
agent, or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the
scope of the officer's, agent's, or employee's office or employment, except
that if the section defining the offense designates the officers, agents, or
employees for whose conduct the organization is accountable or the
circumstances under which it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated, or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners, or by a
high managerial officer, agent, or employee acting in behalf of the
organization and within the scope of such a board's or person's office or
employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent, or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust, or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program.
(ORC 2901.23)
606.09  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent, or employee of an organization, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 2901.23, may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization,
if he or she acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of
the offense, and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he or she engages
in conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such
conduct, or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he or she has
direct responsibility;
      (2)   He or she has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on
the organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
or she is subject to the same penalty as if he or she had acted in his or her
own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
606.10  FALSIFICATION.

commission of a theft offense.
      (10)   The statement is knowingly made to a probate court in connection

      (11)   The statement is made on an account, form, record, stamp, label or
other writing that is required by law.
      (12)   The statement is made in connection with the purchase of a

handgun license or is made in an affidavit submitted to a county sheriff to
obtain a concealed handgun license on a temporary emergency basis under Ohio
R.C. 2923.1213.

with the person’s purchase of cigarettes or tobacco products in a delivery

   (c)   No person, in an attempt to obtain a concealed handgun license under

the death of a person shall fail to report the death immediately to a physician
or advanced practice registered nurse whom the person knows to be treating the
deceased for a condition from which death at such time would not be unexpected,
or to a law enforcement officer, an ambulance service, an emergency squad, or
the coroner in a political subdivision in which the body is discovered, the
death is believed to have occurred, or knowledge concerning the death is
obtained. For purposes of this division, “advanced practice registered nurse”

report required by division (c) of this section was made, or to any law
enforcement officer who has reasonable cause to assert the authority to
investigate the circumstances surrounding the death, any facts within his or

who, outside a hospital, sanitarium, or other medical facility, attends or
treats a person who has sustained a burn injury inflicted by an explosion or
other incendiary device, or that shows evidence of having been inflicted in a
violent, malicious, or criminal manner, shall fail to report the burn injury

      (5)   Anyone participating in the making of reports under division (e) of
this section or anyone participating in a judicial proceeding resulting from

be incurred or imposed as a result of such actions. Notwithstanding Ohio R.C.
4731.22, the physician-patient relationship or advanced practice registered
nurse-patient relationship is not a ground for excluding evidence regarding a
person’s burn injury or the cause of the burn injury in any judicial proceeding
resulting from a report submitted under division (e) of this section.

patient or client has been the victim of domestic violence, as defined in Ohio
R.C. 3113.31, shall note that knowledge or belief and the basis for it in the
patient’s or client’s records.
      (2)   Notwithstanding Ohio R.C. 4731.22, the physician-patient privilege
or advanced practice registered nurse-patient privilege shall not be a ground
for excluding any information regarding the report containing the knowledge or
belief noted under division (f)(1) of this section, and the information may be
admitted as evidence in accordance with the Rules of Evidence.

attorney and client; physician and patient; advanced practice registered nurse
and patient; licensed psychologist or licensed school psychologist and client;
licensed professional clinical counselor, licensed professional counselor,
independent social worker, social worker, independent marriage and family
therapist, or marriage and family therapist and client; member of the clergy,

a communications assistant and those who are a party to a telecommunications
relay service call.
      (2)   The information would tend to incriminate a member of the actor’s
immediate family.
      (3)   Disclosure of the information would amount to revealing a news
source, privileged under Ohio R.C. 2739.04 or 2739.12.
      (4)   Disclosure of the information would amount to disclosure by a
member of the ordained clergy of an organized religious body of a confidential
communication made to him or her in his or her capacity as such by a person
seeking his or her aid or counsel.
      (5)   Disclosure would amount to revealing information acquired by the
actor in the course of his or her duties in connection with a bona fide program
of treatment or services for drug dependent persons or persons in danger of
drug dependence, which program is maintained or conducted by a hospital,

defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense, or an offense, the court shall charge the jury in accordance with Ohio
R.C. 2923.03(D).

thereupon issued by such public officials.  The owner of any private property
apprehending or impounding an animal contrary to the provisions hereof or using
means or measures which are not permitted by the foregoing provisions shall
forfeit the privilege herein granted of apprehending and impounding such
animal; otherwise the owner of private property acting hereunder shall be
immune from any civil charge or action by the owner of such animal as to any
action taken by such owner of private property under the provisions hereof. 
The term “owner of private property” shall be deemed to include members of the
immediate household of such owner or any other parties having possessory rights

(ORC 955.22)
   (l)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (l). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (f) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (l), or on
appeal as described in this division (l), to be a vicious dog, Ohio R.C 955.11
(D) and divisions (f) to (k) of this section apply with respect to the dog and
the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog,
and Section 618.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous
dog, and the court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions
apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that
manner. As part of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or
harborer to obtain the liability insurance required under division (g)(1) in an
amount described in division (n)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (l), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in Ohio R.C. 955.11.

section or a violation of division (e) of this section that involves a dog that
is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the

that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the first
offense and of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on each subsequent offense
involving the same dog. Upon a person being convicted of or pleading guilty to
a third violation of division (e) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (n)(2)A. of

liability insurance pursuant to division (g) of this section. The court, in the
alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (e) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in
accordance with division (f) of this section or at the county dog pound at the
owner’s expense.

            2.   A misdemeanor of the first degree if the dog causes serious
injury to a person. Additionally, the court may order the vicious dog to be
humanely destroyed by a licensed veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the
county humane society at the owner’s expense.
         B.   If the court does not order the vicious dog to be destroyed under
division (n)(5)A.2. of this section, the court shall issue an order that
specifies that Ohio R.C. 955.11(D) and divisions (f) to (k) of this section
apply with respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as
if the dog were a dangerous dog and that Section 618.18 applies with respect to
the dog as if it were a dangerous dog. As part of the order, the court shall
order the offender to obtain the liability insurance required under division
(g)(1) of this section in an amount, exclusive of interest and costs, that
equals or exceeds one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000). Until the court
makes a final determination and during the pendency of any appeal of a

of this section and at the discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be
confined or restrained in accordance with the provisions of division (f) of

of an institution of higher education that has its main campus in this State
and that is accredited by the Association of American Universities or the North

purpose of providing scientific service to law enforcement agencies, and signed
by the person performing the analysis, stating that the substance that is the
basis of the alleged offense has been weighed and analyzed and stating the
findings as to the content, weight, and identity of the substance and that it
contains any amount of a controlled substance and the number and description of
unit dosages, is prima facie evidence of the content, identity, and weight or
the existence and number of unit dosages of the substance. In any criminal
prosecution for a violation of Ohio R.C. 2925.041 or a violation of this
chapter, Ohio R.C. Chapter 2925 or Ohio R.C. Chapter 3719 that is based on the
possession of chemicals sufficient to produce a compound, mixture, preparation,
or substance included in Schedule I, II, III, IV, or V, a laboratory report
from the Bureau or from any laboratory that is operated or established as
described in this division that is signed by the person performing the
analysis, stating that the substances that are the basis of the alleged offense
have been weighed and analyzed and stating the findings as to the content,
weight, and identity of each of the substances, is prima facie evidence of the
content, identity, and weight of the substances.
      (2)   Attached to that report shall be a copy of a notarized statement by
the signer of the report giving the name of the signer and stating that the
signer is an employee of the laboratory issuing the report and that performing
the analysis is a part of the signer’s regular duties, and giving an outline of
the signer’s education, training, and experience for performing an analysis of
materials included under this section.  The signer shall attest that
scientifically accepted tests were performed with due caution, and that the

attorney, prior to any proceeding in which the report is to be used against the
accused other than at a preliminary hearing or grand jury proceeding where the
report may be used without having been previously served upon the accused.
   (c)   The report shall not be prima facie evidence of the contents,
identity, and weight or the existence and number of unit dosages of the
substance if the accused or the accused’s attorney demands the testimony of the
person signing the report, by serving the demand upon the prosecuting attorney,
within seven days from the accused or the accused’s attorney’s receipt of the
report.  The time may be extended by a trial judge in the interests of justice.

the accused person, or, if the accused is indigent, by a qualified laboratory
analyst appointed by the court.  Such portion shall be a representative sample
of the entire substance that is, or of each of the substances that are, the
basis of the alleged violation and shall be of sufficient size, in the opinion
of the court, to permit the accused’s analyst to make a thorough scientific
analysis concerning the identity of the substance or substances.  The
prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s analyst with the sample
portion at least 14 days prior to trial, unless the trial is to be held in a
court not of record or unless the accused person is charged with a minor
misdemeanor, in which case the prosecuting attorney shall provide the accused’s
analyst with the sample portion at least three days prior to trial.  If the
prosecuting attorney determines that such a sample portion cannot be preserved
and given to the accused’s analyst, the prosecuting attorney shall so inform
the accused person, or the accused’s attorney.  In such a circumstance, the
accused person is entitled, upon written request made to the prosecuting
attorney, to have the accused’s privately employed or court appointed analyst
present at an analysis of the substance that is, or the substances that are,
the basis of the alleged violation, and, upon further written request, to
receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result from the analysis

of the alleged violation.  Also, the accused person is entitled, upon further
written request, to receive copies of all recorded scientific data that result
from the measurement or weighing and that can be used by an analyst in arriving
at conclusions, findings, or opinions concerning the weight, volume, or number
of unit doses of the substance subject to the measurement or weighing.

representative and may have the assistance of an attorney. The parties may
present testimony and evidence, and the right to cross-examine witnesses shall
be preserved. All testimony and evidence shall be given under oath or by
affirmation. The Executive Secretary shall keep a full record of the hearing,

jurisdiction. In any such proceeding where the court determines that there has
been a violation of this chapter, the court shall award compensatory damages
and, where appropriate, punitive damages, along with attorney fees. The court
may also order such other relief as it deems necessary or appropriate.

or a mentally or physically disabled child under 21 years of age, shall create
a substantial risk to the health or safety of the child by violating a duty of
care, protection, or support.  It is not a violation of a duty of care,
protection, or support under this division when the parent, guardian,
custodian, or person having custody or control of a child treats the physical
or mental illness or disability of the child by spiritual means through prayer
alone, in accordance with the tenets of a recognized religious body.

      (3)   Administer corporal punishment or other physical disciplinary
measure, or physically restrain the child in a cruel manner or for a prolonged

circumstances and creates a substantial risk of serious physical harm to the
child.
      (4)   Repeatedly administer unwarranted disciplinary measures to a child
when there is a substantial risk that such conduct, if continued, will
seriously impair or retard the child’s mental health or development.

allow the child to act, model, or in any other way participate in, or be

know is obscene, is sexually oriented matter, or is nudity-oriented matter.
      (6)   Allow the child to be on the same parcel of real property and
within 100 feet of, or, in the case of more than one housing unit on the same

law, a person may be convicted at the same trial or proceeding of a violation
of this division and a violation of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(A), or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, that constitutes the basis of the charge of the
violation of this division.  For purposes of Ohio R.C. 4511.191 to 4511.197 and
all related provisions of law, a person arrested for a violation of this
division shall be considered to be under arrest for operating a vehicle while
under the influence of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a

teacher, person pursing bona fide studies for research, librarian, member of
the clergy, prosecutor, judge, or other person having a proper interest in the
material or performance.
      (2)   Mistake of age is not a defense to a charge under division (b)(5)
of this section.
      (3)   In a prosecution under division (b)(5) of this section, the trier
of fact may infer that an actor, model, or participant in the material or
performance involved is a juvenile if the material or performance, through its

   (d)   “Street” means a way or place, of whatever nature, open to the use of
the public as a matter of right for purposes of vehicular travel or, in the
case of a sidewalk thereof, for pedestrian travel. “Street” includes the legal

nocturnal hours for which Section
632.02 is intended to provide the maximum limits of regulation shall not be
considered in violation of this chapter:
      (1)   When accompanied by a parent of such minor;
      (2)   When accompanied by an adult authorized by a parent of such minor
to take the parent's place in accompanying the minor for a designated period of
time and purpose within a specified area;
      (3)   When exercising First Amendment rights protected by the United
States Constitution, such as the free exercise of religion, freedom of speech
and the right of assembly. Such minor shall evidence the bona fides of such
exercise by first delivering a written notice signed by such minor and
countersigned, if practical, by a parent of such minor with their home address
and telephone number addressed to the Mayor, specifying when, where and in what
matter the minor will be on the streets at night, during the hours when this
chapter is otherwise applicable to the minor, in the exercise of a First
Amendment right specified in such communication.
      (4)   In case of reasonable necessity, but only after such minors parent
has communicated to the Police Station personnel the facts establishing such
reasonable necessity relating to specified streets at a designated time for a
described purpose including points of origin and destination. A copy of such
communication, or of the police record thereof, duly certified by the Chief of
Police to be correct, with an appropriate notation of the time it was received
and of the names and address of such parent and minor, shall be admissible
evidence.
      (5)   When the minor is on the sidewalk of the place where such minor
resides, or on the sidewalk of either next-door neighbor not communicating an
objection to the Police Officer;
      (6)   When returning home by a direct route from, and within thirty
minutes of the termination of, a school activity or an activity of a religious
or other voluntary association of which prior notice, indicating the place and
probable time of termination, has been given in writing to, and duly filed for
immediate reference by, the Chief of Police or the officer assigned by him on
duty at the Police Station;
      (7)   When the minor carries a certified card of employment renewable
each calendar month when the current facts so warrant, dated or reissued not
more than forty-five days previously, signed by the Chief of Police and briefly
identifying the minor, the addresses of his home and place of employment and
his hours of employment;
      (8)   When the minor is, with parental consent, in a motor vehicle. This
contemplates normal travel and also exempts interstate travel beginning or
ending in the City.
      (9)   When the minor is seventeen years of age, if and when the Mayor has
so determined, by formal rule first reported to Council, spread upon its
minutes and so reported in the press, finding the facts as to the extent of
juvenile delinquency in such age group permitting such rule, currently, in the
best interests of such minors and of the City, in which case the Mayor, by such
formal rule, covering a period of time designated therein or until recission
thereof not exceeding one year from the date thereof, may take appropriate
action excepting designated minors, minors in a defined group or area or all
minors, as the current facts may warrant, seventeen years of age at that date
or attaining seventeen years of age during the period that such formal rule is
and remains in effect.
   (b)   Each of the foregoing exceptions and their several limitations, such
as provisions for notification, are severable, and additional exceptions, also
severable, broadening with the progress toward maturity of minors enrolled
respectively in elementary, junior high and high schools, will be considered by
Council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student
government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, ward,
precinct and neighborhood spokesmen, parents, officers and persons in authority
concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency.

632.04  PARENTAL RESPONSIBILITY.
   No parent having legal custody of a minor shall knowingly permit or, by
inefficient control, allow such minor to be or remain upon any street under
circumstances not constituting an exception to, or otherwise beyond the scope
of, this chapter. “Knowingly” includes knowledge which a parent should
reasonably be expected to have concerning the whereabouts of a minor in that
parent's legal custody. It is intended to continue to keep neglectful or
careless parents up to a reasonable community standard of parental
responsibility through an objective test. It shall, a fortiori, be no defense
that a parent was completely indifferent to the activities or conduct or
whereabouts of such minor.
(Ord. 77-60. Passed 9-22-77; Ord. 78-25. Passed 3-23-78.)
632.05  POLICE PROCEDURES.
   A policeman, upon finding or having attention called to any minor on the
streets in prima-facie violation of this chapter, normally shall take the minor
to the Police Station, where a parent shall immediately be notified to come for
such minor, whereupon they shall be interrogated. This is intended to permit
ascertainment, under constitutional safeguards, of relevant facts, and to
centralize responsibility in the officer there and then on duty for accurate,
effective, fair, impartial and uniform enforcement and recording, thus making
available experienced supervisory personnel, the best of facilities and access
to information and records. In the absence of convincing evidence, such as a
birth certificate, a policeman on the street shall in the first instance use
his best judgment in determining age.
   (a)   Police procedures shall constantly be refined in the light of
experience and may provide, inter alia, that the policeman may deliver to a
parent thereof a minor under appropriate circumstances, for example, a minor of
tender age near home whose identity and address may readily be ascertained or
are known.
   (b)   In any event, such policeman shall, within twenty-four hours, file a
written report with the Chief of Police, or shall participate, to the extent of
the information for which he is responsible, in the preparation by himself and
with the officer involved in such case, in the filing of such report within
twenty-four hours.
   (c)   When a parent, immediately called, has come to take charge of the
minor, and the appropriate information has been recorded, the minor shall be
released to the custody of such parent. If the parent cannot be located, or
fails to take charge of the minor, then the minor shall be released to the
juvenile authorities, except to the extent that in accordance with police
regulations, approved in advance by juvenile authorities, the minor may
temporarily be entrusted to a relative, neighbor or other person who will, on
behalf of a parent, assume the responsibility of caring for the minor pending
the availability or arrival of a parent.
   (d)   In the case of a first violation by a minor, the Chief of Police
shall, by certified mail, send to a parent written notice of the violation with
a warning that any subsequent violation will result in full enforcement of this
chapter, including enforcement of parental responsibility and of applicable
penalties.
(Ord. 77-60. Passed 9-22-77; Ord. 78-25. Passed 3-23-78.)
632.06  VIOLATIONS.
   (a)   If, after the warning notice of a first violation by a minor, given
pursuant to Section
632.05, a parent violates Section
632.04 in connection with a second violation by such minor, this shall be
treated as a first offense by the parent. For such first parental offense, a
parent shall be guilty of a minor misdemeanor and for each subsequent offense a
parent shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree. Punishment shall
be as provided in Section
698.02.
   (b)   Any minor who violates any provision of this chapter more than three
times shall be dealt with in accordance with Juvenile Court law and procedure.
   (c)   A like procedure, before the juvenile authorities, shall be followed
in any case where the provisions of this chapter cannot be made effective by
the imposition of other penalties under this section.

standards in the adult community as a whole with respect to what is suitable

performance is “obscene” if any of the following apply:
      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest.

bestiality or extreme or bizarre violence, cruelty, or brutality.
      (4)   Its dominant tendency is to appeal to scatological interest by

house, or his lessee or agent or the person in possession, charge or control
thereof, directing him to abate such nuisance and remove the unclean or
unsanitary conditions within such reasonable time as may be fixed by such Board
and specified in such notice, it shall then be the duty of such owner, agent or

698.01  DEFINITIONS.
   As used in this chapter:
   (a)   “Dangerous offender” means a person who has committed an offense,
whose history, character and condition reveal a substantial risk that he or she
will be a danger to others, and whose conduct has been characterized by a
pattern of repetitive, compulsive or aggressive behavior with heedless
indifference to the consequences.
   (b)   “Repeat offender” means a person who has a history of persistent
criminal activity and whose character and condition reveal a substantial risk
that he or she will commit another offense. It is prima facie evidence that a
person is a repeat offender if any of the following applies:
      (1)   Having been convicted of one or more offenses of violence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent offense of
violence;
      (2)   Having been convicted of one or more sexually oriented offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2950.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent sexually
oriented offense;
      (3)   Having been convicted of one or more theft offenses, as defined in
Ohio R.C. 2913.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for one or
more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent theft offense;
      (4)   Having been convicted of one or more felony drug abuse offenses, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.01, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence
for one or more of those offenses, the person commits a subsequent felony drug
abuse offense;
      (5)   Having been convicted of two or more felonies, and having been
imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such offense, the person commits a
subsequent offense;
      (6)   Having been convicted of three or more offenses of any type or
degree other than traffic offenses, alcoholic intoxication offenses, or minor
misdemeanors, and having been imprisoned pursuant to sentence for any such
offense, the person commits a subsequent offense.
(ORC 2935.36(E))
698.02  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (b)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (b)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (b)(1) to (b)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Section
666.99 or
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)(5) or (b)
(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized pursuant
to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a
misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section. The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months.
   The additional jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of
the Ohio Revised Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term
consecutively to and prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense
and consecutively to any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the
offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241 or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) of
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1423 that charges that
the victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at
the time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory
jail term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Section
666.99 and
698.03 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a jail term is
required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five- year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2925.11(B)(2)(b),
or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated
the conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,
whichever is shorter, if the political subdivision that would have
responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in Ohio R.C.
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with Ohio R.C. 307.932. In all
other cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential
sanction under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or a minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C, and other contagious
diseases. The person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction may cause a convicted offender in the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place who refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis,
HIV infection, hepatitis, including, but not limited to, hepatitis A, B, and C,
or another contagious disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of day reporting;
         B.   A term of house arrest with electronic monitoring or continuous

is a violation of Ohio R.C. 2919.25 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve  mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours. 
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender's crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim's economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the Clerk of the Court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. The court may base the
amount of restitution it orders on an amount recommended by the victim, the
offender, a presentence investigation report, estimates or receipts indicating
the cost of repairing or replacing property, and other information, provided
that the amount the court orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of
economic loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the
commission of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the
court shall hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim,
or survivor disputes the amount of restitution.  If the court holds an
evidentiary hearing, at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to
prove by a preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from
the offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under Ohio R.C. 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than five per cent of the amount of the
restitution otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and
processing restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.
         B.   Fines. A fine of the type described in divisions (f)(1)B.1. and
2. of this section payable to the appropriate entity as required by law:
            1.   A fine in the following amount:
               a.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00);
               b.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than seven
hundred fifty dollars ($750.00);
               c.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00);
               d.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two
hundred fifty dollars ($250.00);
               e.   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one hundred fifty
dollars ($150.00).
            2.   A State fine or cost as defined in Ohio R.C. 2949.111.
         C.   Reimbursement.
            1.   Reimbursement by the offender of any or all of the costs of
sanctions incurred by the government, including, but not limited to, the
following:
               a.   All or part of the costs of implementing any community
control sanction, including a supervision fee under Ohio R.C. 2951.021;
               b.   All or part of the costs of confinement in a jail or other
residential facility, including, but not limited to, a per diem fee for room
and board, the costs of medical and dental treatment, and the costs of
repairing property damaged by the offender while confined;
               c.   All or part of the cost of purchasing and using an
immobilizing or disabling device, including a certified ignition interlock
device, or a remote alcohol monitoring device that a court orders an offender
to use under Ohio R.C. 4510.13.
            2.   The amount of reimbursement under division (f)(1)C.1. of this
section shall not exceed the total amount of reimbursement the offender is able
to pay and shall not exceed the actual cost of the sanctions. The court may
collect any amount of reimbursement the offender is required to pay under that
division. If the court does not order reimbursement under that division,
confinement costs may be assessed pursuant to a repayment policy adopted under
Ohio R.C. 2929.37. In addition, the offender may be required to pay the fees
specified in Ohio R.C. 2929.38 in accordance with that section.
      (2)   A.   If the court determines a hearing is necessary, the court may
hold a hearing to determine whether the offender is able to pay the financial
sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f) or court costs or is likely in
the future to be able to pay the sanction or costs.
         B.   If the court determines that the offender is indigent and unable
to pay the financial sanction or court costs, the court shall consider imposing
and may impose a term of community service under division (e)(1) of this
section in lieu of imposing a financial sanction or court costs. If the court
does not determine that the offender is indigent, the court may impose a term
of community service under division (e)(1) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this division (f) and in
addition to imposing court costs. The court may order community service for a
minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction
or court costs.
      (3)   A.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the
offender pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs
incurred by a county pursuant to any sanction imposed under division (d), (e),
or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine offenders
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to the County
Treasurer. The County Treasurer shall deposit the reimbursements in the
County's General Fund. The County shall use the amounts deposited in the fund
to pay the costs incurred by the County pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         B.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed upon the offender
pursuant to division (f)(1)C. of this section to pay the costs incurred by a
municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under division  (d),
(e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to confine
offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this section to
the Treasurer of the municipal corporation. The Treasurer shall deposit the
reimbursements in the municipal corporation's General Fund. The municipal
corporation shall use the amounts deposited in the fund to pay the costs
incurred by the municipal corporation pursuant to any sanction imposed under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section or in operating a facility used to
confine offenders pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d) of this
section.
         C.   The offender shall pay reimbursements imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)C. of this section for the costs incurred by a private provider
pursuant to a sanction imposed under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section
to the provider.
      (4)   In addition to any other fine that is or may be imposed under this
division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by Ohio R.C. 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction. 
A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.b.
of this section upon an offender confined in a jail or other residential
facility is a judgment in favor of the entity operating the jail or other
residential facility. A financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to
division (f)(1)A. of this section is an order in favor of the victim of the
offender’s criminal act that can be collected through a certificate of judgment
as described in division (f)(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as
described in division (f)(5)B.2. of this section or through an order as
described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this section and the offender shall be
considered for purposes of the collection as a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.
(ORC 2929.28)
698.03  IMPOSING SENTENCE FOR MISDEMEANOR.
   (a)   (1)   Unless a mandatory jail term is required to be imposed by Ohio
R.C. 1547.99(G), 4510.14(B), or 4511.19(G), or any other provision of the
Revised Code, or any municipal ordinance, a court that imposes a sentence under
this chapter upon an offender for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor has
discretion to determine the most effective way to achieve the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02.
      (2)   Unless a specific sanction is required to be imposed or is
precluded from being imposed by the section setting forth an offense or the
penalty for an offense or by any provision of Sections
666.99 or
698.02 of this Code or Ohio R.C. 2929.23 to 2929.28, a court that imposes a
sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor may impose on the offender any
sanction or combination of sanctions under Section
698.02(b) to (f). The court shall not impose a sentence that imposes an
unnecessary burden on local government resources.
   (b)   (1)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, the
court shall consider all of the following factors:
         A.   The nature and circumstances of the offense or offenses;
         B.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender has a history of persistent criminal
activity and that the offender's character and condition reveal a substantial
risk that the offender will commit another offense;
         C.   Whether the circumstances regarding the offender and the offense
or offenses indicate that the offender's history, character, and condition
reveal a substantial risk that the offender will be a danger to others and that
the offender's conduct has been characterized by a pattern of repetitive,
compulsive, or aggressive behavior with heedless indifference to the
consequences;
         D.   Whether the victim's youth, age, disability, or other factor made
the victim particularly vulnerable to the offense or made the impact of the
offense more serious;
         E.   Whether the offender is likely to commit future crimes in
general, in addition to the circumstances described in divisions (b)(1)B. and
C. of this section;
         F.   Whether the offender has an emotional, mental, or physical
condition that is traceable to the offender’s service in the armed forces of
the United States and that was a contributing factor in the offender’s
commission of the offense or offenses;
         G.   The offender’s military service record.
      (2)   In determining the appropriate sentence for a misdemeanor, in
addition to complying with division (b)(1) of this section, the court may
consider any other factors that are relevant to achieving the purposes and
principles of sentencing set forth in Section
698.02(a).
   (c)   Before imposing a jail term as a sentence for a misdemeanor, a court
shall consider the appropriateness of imposing a community control sanction or
a combination of community control sanctions under Section
698.02(c), (d), (e), and (f). A court may impose the longest jail term
authorized under Section
698.02(b) only upon offenders who commit the worst forms of the offense or upon
offenders whose conduct and response to prior sanctions for prior offenses
demonstrate that the imposition of the longest jail term is necessary to deter
the offender from committing a future crime.
   (d)   (1)   A sentencing court shall consider any relevant oral or written
statement made by the victim, the defendant, the defense attorney, or the
prosecuting authority regarding sentencing for a misdemeanor. This division
does not create any rights to notice other than those rights authorized by Ohio
R.C. Chapter 2930.
      (2)   At the time of sentencing for a misdemeanor or as soon as possible
after sentencing, the court shall notify the victim of the offense of the
victim's right to file an application for an award of reparations pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2743.51 to 2743.72.
(ORC 2929.22)
698.04  ORGANIZATIONAL PENALTIES.
   (a)   Regardless of the other penalties provided in Section
698.02, an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09 shall be fined by the court as follows:
      (1)   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than five thousand
dollars ($5,000.00);
      (2)   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than four thousand
dollars ($4,000.00);
      (3)   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than three thousand
dollars ($3,000.00);
      (4)   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than two thousand
dollars ($2,000.00);
      (5)   For a minor misdemeanor, not more than one thousand dollars
($1,000.00);
      (6)   For a misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than two
thousand dollars ($2,000.00);
      (7)   For a minor misdemeanor not specifically classified, not more than
one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).
   (b)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the section defining the offense or penalty plainly indicates a
purpose to impose the penalty provided for violation upon organizations, then
such penalty shall be imposed in lieu of the penalty provided in this section.
   (c)   When an organization is convicted of an offense not specifically
classified, and the penalty provided includes a higher fine than that provided
in this section, then the penalty imposed shall be pursuant to the penalty
provided for violation of the section defining the offense.
   (d)   This section does not prevent the imposition of available civil
sanctions against an organization convicted of an offense pursuant to Section
606.09, either in addition to or in lieu of a fine imposed pursuant to this
section.
(ORC 2929.31)
698.05  MULTIPLE SENTENCES.
   (a)   Except as provided in division (b) of this section, Ohio R.C. 2929.14
(C), or Ohio R.C. 2971.03(D) or (E), a prison term, jail term, or  sentence of
imprisonment shall be served concurrently with any other prison term, jail
term, or sentence of imprisonment imposed by a court of this Municipality, the
State, another State, or the United States.  Except as provided in division (b)
(2) of this section, a jail term or sentence of imprisonment for misdemeanor
shall be served concurrently with a prison term or sentence of imprisonment for
felony served in a State or Federal correctional institution.
   (b)   (1)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment for a misdemeanor shall
be served consecutively to any other prison term, jail term, or sentence of
imprisonment when the trial court specifies that it is to be served
consecutively or when it is imposed for a misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C.
2907.322, 2921.34 or 2923.131.  When consecutive sentences are imposed for
misdemeanors under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of the
consecutive terms imposed, except that the aggregate term to be served shall
not exceed 18 months.
      (2)   A jail term or sentence of imprisonment imposed for a misdemeanor
violation of Ohio R.C. 4510.14, 4510.16, 4510.21, or 4511.19, or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, shall be served consecutively to
a prison term that is imposed for a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.06,
2903.07, 2903.08 or 4511.19 or a felony violation of Ohio R.C. 2903.04
involving the operation of a motor vehicle by the offender and that is served
in a State correctional institution when the trial court specifies that it is
to be served consecutively. When consecutive jail terms or sentences of
imprisonment and prison terms are imposed for one or more misdemeanors and one
or more felonies under this division, the term to be served is the aggregate of
the consecutive terms imposed, and the offender shall serve all terms imposed
for a felony before serving any term imposed for a misdemeanor.
(ORC 2929.41)
698.06  MODIFICATION OF SENTENCE. (REPEALED)
   (EDITOR'S NOTE:  Section
698.06 was repealed as part of the 2004 updating and revision of this Municipal
Code because substantially equivalent State law (Ohio R.C. 2929.51) was
repealed by the Ohio General Assembly.)
698.07  SUSPENSION OF DRIVER’S LICENSE.
   Except as otherwise provided in Ohio R.C. 4510.07 or in any other provision
of the Revised Code, whenever an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
violation of any provision of this Code of Ordinances that is substantially
equivalent to a provision of the Revised Code, and a court is permitted or
required to suspend a person's driver's or commercial driver's license or
permit for a violation of that provision, a court, in addition to any other
penalties authorized by law, may suspend the offender's driver's or commercial
driver's license or permit or nonresident operating privileges for the period
of time the court determines appropriate, but the period of suspension imposed
for the violation of the provision of this Code of Ordinances shall not exceed
the period of suspension that is permitted or required to be imposed for the
violation of the provision of the Revised Code to which the provision of this
Code of Ordinances is substantially equivalent.

810.08  REVOCATION OR SUSPENSION.
   Any license may be revoked by the Mayor or other chief administrative
officer at any time for conditions or considerations which, had they existed at

misrepresentation of a material fact in the application discovered after
issuance of the license; for violation of any provision of this chapter or
other law or ordinance relating to the operation of the business or enterprise
for which the license has been issued; or upon conviction of a licensee for a
violation of any Federal, State or municipal law or ordinance involving moral

838.01  PURPOSES.
   This chapter is enacted to protect the health, safety and welfare of the
residents of the City by generating funds not for general revenue purposes but
for the sole purpose of producing sufficient funds to monitor ground water and
surface water contamination; to provide funds to monitor air pollution
standards; to provide funds for road maintenance for hazardous waste
transportation to such sites; to provide funds for the extraordinary expenses
of police and fire protection to monitor the disposal of hazardous wastes; to
provide funds necessary for insurance premiums for liability insurance for the
City for potential future claims against the City resulting from the operation
of hazardous waste landfills; to provide funds for engineering, legal and other
professional services necessary to monitor the operation and results of the
hazardous waste landfills to ensure that all State and Federal regulations are
being complied with; and to provide funds for other expenses directly related
to monitoring the operation of hazardous waste landfill sites.
   A further purpose of this chapter is to meet the variety and complexity of
problems relating to water, air and land pollution in the City affected by any
hazardous waste landfill facility and to achieve a reasonable degree of purity
of water, air and land resources within the City consistent with the maximum
enjoyment and use thereof in furtherance of the health, safety and welfare of
the residents, as the same might be affected by local conditions because of the
contiguous land located in the City adjacent to a hazardous waste landfill
facility and other areas that are within the surrounding proximity of such
hazardous waste landfill facility that might be affected by the operation of
the hazardous waste landfill facility.
(Ord. 83-4. Passed 2-10-83. )

   (a)   "City" means the City of Northwood, Ohio.
   (b)   "Disposal" means the discharge, deposit, injection, dumping, spilling,

such hazardous waste or any constituent thereof may enter the environment or be
emitted into the air or discharged into any waters, including ground waters.
   (c)   "Facility" means any site, location, tract of land, installation or

Code and, in addition, means any waste or combination of wastes in sold,
liquid, semisolid or contained gaseous form which, in the determination of the
Ohio Director of Environmental Protection, because of its quantity,
concentration or physical, chemical or infectious characteristics, may: (1)
Cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in
serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness; or (2) Pose a
substantial present or potential hazard to human health or safety or to the
environment when improperly stored, treated, transported or disposed of, or
otherwise managed. Hazardous waste includes any substance identified by
regulation as hazardous waste under the "Resource Conservation and Recovery Act
of 1976," 90 Stat. 2806 to 2812, 42 U. S. C. 6921 to 6931.

the City in accordance with any State permit. The fee shall be as set forth in

upon the monthly totals of hazardous waste disposed of at the facility located
within the City limits according to the manifests filed by the operator of the
hazardous waste landfill with the regulatory agencies and according to such
other methods of determining tonnage as may be agreed upon by the City and the
facility operator.
   The permit fee shall be paid by the twenty-fifth day of each month following
the calendar month for which the report is filed.
   If any proper Court of record ever challenges the amount of the permit fee
imposed by this section, such fee shall not be reduced below the amount set
forth in

Court order, in compliance with the decision of the Supreme Court in the State
involving the Fondessy Enterprise Landfill, which Court found such amount for
hazardous waste deposit a reasonable fee.

838.04  NORTHWOOD HAZARDOUS WASTE LANDFILL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION FUND.
   There is hereby created a fund to be known as the Northwood Hazardous Waste
Landfill Environmental Protection Fund, which shall be the depository of all of

are being fully complied with; to provide funds for scientific analysis of
surface water and/or ground water contamination during the operation of the
hazardous waste landfill; to provide funds for monitoring air pollution
resulting from the operation of the hazardous waste landfill site; and to
provide funds for other expenses directly related to the operation of the
hazardous waste landfill. If State law is amended and a fee or tax is levied on
hazardous waste or solid waste facilities or local governments are authorized
to levy such a fee or tax, and the proceeds of such fee or tax should go to the
City for purposes similar to the purposes enumerated in this section, the
permit fee established by this chapter shall be credited toward the payment of
such fee or tax.

   Council, on or before April 15, 1985, and on or before April 15 of each odd

wastes should be increased, decreased or remain the same, so that sufficient
funds are generated to provide for the protection of the local environment in
order to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the residents of the
City. Such funds shall not exceed the amount necessary to carry out the
specific restricted purposes set forth in Section
838.04, but shall be sufficient to cover all costs incurred in the

this chapter, if the books and records of a taxpayer conducting a business or
profession, both within and outside the boundaries of the City, disclose with
reasonable accuracy what portion of its net profit is attributable to that part
of the business or profession conducted within the boundaries of the City, then
only such portion shall be considered as having a taxable situs in the City for

the tax in the same proportion as the average ratio of:

period to persons employed in the business or profession, wherever their

services performed during the taxable period in the City to gross receipts of
the business or profession during the same period from sales and services,
wherever made or performed.
      (2)   In the event that the foregoing allocation formula does not produce
an equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be
substituted so as to produce such result.
      (3)   As used in this subsection, “sales made in the City” means:
         A.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within
the City, regardless of where title passes, if shipped or delivered from a
stock of goods within the City.
         B.   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within

transported from a point outside the City, if the taxpayer is regularly
engaged, through its own employment, in the solicitation or promotion of sales
within the City and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
         C.   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a
place within the City to purchasers outside the City, regardless of where title

stockholders or with other corporations related by stock ownership,
interlocking directorates or some other method, or in case any person operates
a division, branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity within the City
constituting a portion only of its total business, the Commissioner shall
require such additional information as he or she may deem necessary to
ascertain whether net profits are properly allocated to the City by reason of
transactions with stockholders or with other corporations related by stock
ownership, interlocking directorates, or transactions with such division,
branch, factory, office, laboratory or activity, or by some other method, he or

(Ord. 94-58.  Passed 11-22-94; Ord. 2004-5.  Passed 2-12-04.)
880.05  REGISTRATION, RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   All taxpayers, as described in Section
880.02 of the tax code, shall be required to complete and submit a registration
form from the Department of Taxation.
   (b)   Each taxpayer who or which has income subject to the tax imposed by
this chapter shall, whether or not a tax is due, file a completed tax return on
or before April 15 of each year.  If the tax return is for a fiscal year, it
shall be filed on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month from the end
of such fiscal year.  A tax return is considered to be timely filed if it is
received or postmarked by the USPS on or before the due date.
   (c)   The return shall be filed with the Commissioner of Taxation on a form
furnished by or obtainable upon request from such Commissioner setting forth,
for the period indicated thereon:
      (1)   The aggregate amount of salaries, wages (including tips and
gratuities), commissions and other compensation earned as defined at Section
880.02(v);
      (2)   The gross income from a business, profession or other activity less
allowable expenses incurred in the acquisition of such gross income;
      (3)   The amount of tax imposed by this chapter on income reported;
      (4)   Any payments or credits to which the taxpayer may be entitled under
the provisions of Sections
880.06,
880.07, or
880.15; and
      (5)   Such other pertinent statements, information returns or other data
and information as the Commissioner may require.
   (d)   Commencing with tax returns for the year commencing on January 1,
1983, the net loss from a business entity and/or rental loss may not be used to
offset salaries, wages, commissions or the net income from any other entity or
activity.  Each such loss may be carried forward to offset future income from
the same entity for the same owner in accordance with Section
880.03(c).  Each business profit that exceeds loss carry-forwards from the same
entity must be included in taxable income.
   (e)   The income referred to in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) hereof shall
include only income earned during the year, or portion thereof, covered by the
return and subject to the tax imposed by this chapter.
   (f)   Extension of time for filing returns. Taxpayers granted extensions of
time for filing their Federal Income Tax Returns have an extension for filing
their City tax returns, provided that a copy of the federal extension is filed
with the Commissioner on or before the original due date of the City return.
   The extended date for filing the City return will be the last day of the
month following the month to which the federal return was extended. Statutory
interest of one percent (1%) per month (Section
880.10) or fraction thereof will be charged from the original due date of the
return until the date of payment. The extension is for extending the due date
of the tax return and does not extend the time for paying any tax due.
   If a taxpayer wishes to extend the time for filing the City tax return to a
date other than that provided by the automatic federal extension, the taxpayer
must file such request in writing to the Commissioner prior to the due date of
the automatic extension. The extension may be granted by the Commissioner upon
terms and conditions set forth by him or her. A taxpayer's extension requested
may be denied if the taxpayer is delinquent in the filing of any tax returns or
payments of any taxes, penalties, or interest due.
   The failure of a taxpayer to comply with paragraph (f)(1) or (2) hereof in
obtaining an extension will result in a penalty and interest being assessed
from the original due date of the return.
   (g)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay
to the Commissioner the balance of tax due, if any, after deducting:
      (1)   The amount of Municipal income tax deducted or withheld at the
source pursuant to Section
880.06;
      (2)   Such portion of the tax as has been paid as an estimate by the
taxpayer pursuant to Section
880.07; and
      (3)   Any credit allowable under the provisions of Section
880.15.
      If the tax remaining due after the application of paragraphs (g)(1), (2)
and (3) hereof is less than five dollars ($5.00), no remittance need be made.
   (h)   Should the return or the records of the Commissioner indicate an
overpayment of the tax to which the City is entitled under the provisions of
this chapter, such overpayment shall first be applied against any existing
liability of the taxpayer and the balance, if any, at the election of the
taxpayer communicated to the Commissioner, shall be refunded or carried forward
to be used against any subsequent liability, provided that overpayment of less
than five dollars ($5.00) shall not be refunded.
   (i)   Where necessary, an amended return must be filed in order to report
additional income and pay any additional tax due, or claim a refund of tax
overpaid, subject to the requirements and/or limitations contained in Sections
880.11 and
880.15.  Such amended returns shall be on a form obtainable on request from the
Commissioner.  A taxpayer may not change the method of accounting or
apportionment of net profits after the due date for filing the original return.
   (j)   Within three months from the final determination of any Federal tax
liability affecting the taxpayer's City tax liability, such taxpayer shall make
and file an amended City return showing income subject to the City tax based
upon such final determination of Federal tax liability, and pay any additional
tax shown due thereon or make claim for refund of any overpayment.
   (k)   All individuals, businesses, employers, brokers or others doing
business who engage persons, either on a commission basis or as independent
contractors, and who are not subject to withholding, shall provide to the
Commissioner of Taxation the total amount of earnings, payments, commissions
and bonuses to such persons who are residents of the City, or who do business
in the City, providing the same information as is required on Federal Form
1099, which form can be used in lieu of a listing.  Failure to provide the
required information will result in the disallowance of the deduction claimed
for such payments.  The amount of such payments should be included in the
allocation formula if said formula is used.
   (l)   All taxpayers shall indicate the total amount of payments made to any
subcontractor or contract employee who did business in or is a resident of the
City on the appropriate line of the City income tax return, and shall attach a
list which shall indicate names, addresses, social security numbers and amounts
paid.  Failure to provide the required information will result in the
disallowance of the deduction claimed.
   (m)   A partnership having an office or place of business in the City, or
doing business in the City, shall file their annual tax return as a partnership
entity and pay the tax due thereon.  No deduction shall be allowed for payments
to partners as reported on the Federal tax returns.
   (n)   The officer or employee of such employer having control or supervision
or charged with the responsibility of filing the return and making the payment,
shall be personally liable for failure to file the return or pay the tax,
penalties, or interest due as required herein. The dissolution, bankruptcy or
reorganization of any such employer does not discharge an officer or employee's
liability for a prior failure of such business to file a return or pay taxes,
penalties, or interest due.

880.06  COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING BY EMPLOYER.
   (a)   Each employer within or doing business within the City, employing one
or more persons on a salary, wage, commission or other compensation basis,
shall, at the time of payment thereof, deduct the tax imposed by Section
880.03 from the gross salaries, wages, commissions, including tips or
gratuities, or other compensation earned or paid within the City.
   (b)   Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (a) hereof, where an
employer employs a City resident in another taxing municipality, requiring such
employer to deduct its tax from all employees engaged therein, or in a location
imposing no municipal tax, such employer shall withhold for and remit to the
City the difference, if any, between the tax imposed by such other taxing
municipality and the tax imposed by this chapter, or such employer shall
withhold the City tax on 100 percent of the income subject to the City tax if
the employee works in a location imposing no municipal tax.
   (c)   Any employer who or which deducts the City tax in the amount of five
hundred dollars ($500.00) or more per month during any month of a calendar
quarter, shall remit to the Commissioner of Taxation, on or before the
fifteenth day of the second and third months of each calendar quarter, the
taxes so deducted monthly.
   (d)   Each employer shall, on or before the last day of the month following
each calendar quarter, make a return and remit to the City the tax hereby
required to be withheld.  Such return shall be on a form prescribed by or
acceptable to the Commissioner of Taxation and shall be subject to the rules
and regulations prescribed therefor by the Commissioner.  Such employer shall
be liable for the payment of the tax required to be deducted and withheld,
whether or not such taxes have in fact been withheld.
   (e)   On or before January 31, following any calendar year, each employer
shall file with the Commissioner an information return for each employee from
whom any municipal income tax has been or should have been withheld, showing
the name, address and social security number of the employee, the total amount
of compensation paid during the year, the amount of any municipal income tax
withheld from such employee, the municipality  for which it is withheld and the
amount withheld therefor.  The information return shall include the same
information required to be reported to the IRS by the employer.
   (f)   Each employer, in collecting such tax, shall be deemed to hold the
same until payment is made by such employer to the City, as a Trustee for the
benefit of the City, and any such tax collected by such employer from employees
shall, until the same is paid to the City, be deemed a trust fund in the hands
of such employer.
   (g)   The officer or employee having control or supervision of the report,
or charged with the responsibility of filing the report and making the payment,
is personally liable for failure to file the report or pay the tax, penalties
and interest due, as required by this section.  The dissolution of a
corporation does not discharge an officer's or employee's liability for a prior
failure of the corporation to file returns or to pay the tax due.
   (h)   Every employer shall retain all records necessary to compute
withholding taxes due the City for a period of five years from the date of the
reconciliation form, W-2 forms and 1099 forms are filed.
   (i)   The return is considered received when all returns and forms required
to be filed by an employer are received on the date postmarked by the United
States Postal Services or on the date delivered without mailing by the taxpayer
to the City Tax Office.
   (j)   The failure of any employer to receive or procure a return, or other
required form shall not exclude the employer from preparing any information
return, withholding tax returns or from filing such forms or from paying the
tax due.
   (k)   Payments received for withholding taxes due shall be applied first to
taxes due, then to penalty due, and then to interest due.

operating loss carried forward to not more than five consecutive taxable years
following the taxable year in which the loss was incurred, but in no case for

      (1)   "Domicile" means the true, fixed and permanent home of the taxpayer
to which whenever absent, the taxpayer intends to return.
      (2)   An individual is presumed to be domiciled in the Municipality for

the Tax Administrator reasonably concludes that the individual is domiciled in
the Municipality for all or part of the taxable year.

881.05  COLLECTION AT SOURCE
881.051  COLLECTION AT SOURCE; WITHHOLDING FROM QUALIFYING WAGES.
   (a)   (1)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or
doing business in the Municipality shall withhold from each employee an amount
equal to the qualifying wages of the employee earned by the employee in the
Municipality multiplied by the applicable rate of the Municipality's income
tax, except for qualifying wages for which withholding is not required under
Section
881.052 or division (d) or (f) of this section. An employer, agent of an
employer, or other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying
wages on the date that the employer, agent, or other payer directly,
indirectly, or constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the
qualifying wages to the benefit of, the employee.
      (2)   In addition to withholding the amounts required under division (a)
(1) of this section, an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may also
deduct and withhold, on the request of an employee, taxes for the municipal
corporation in which the employee is a resident.
   (b)   (1)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to
the Tax Administrator of the Municipality the greater of the income taxes
deducted and withheld or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld
by the employer, agent, or other payer, along with any report required by the
Tax Administrator to accompany such payment, according to the following
schedule:
         A.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)B. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the fifteenth day of the month following the end of each
calendar quarter.
         B.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the municipal corporation in the preceding calendar year exceeded two
thousand three hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of
taxes deducted and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf
of the Municipality in any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two
hundred dollars ($200.00). Payment under division (b)(1)B. of this section
shall be made so that the payment is received by the Tax Administrator not
later than fifteen days after the last day of each month.
   (c)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and file
a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or other
payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Municipality as the return required of an
employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this chapter is the
qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, unless the Municipality requires all resident individual taxpayers
to file a tax return under Section
881.091.
   (d)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required to
withhold Municipal income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
   (e)   (1)   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
      (2)   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to
remit to the Municipality the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability
for that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other
payer in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
   (f)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to any
municipal corporation income tax or Municipal income tax withholding
requirement to the extent the deferred compensation does not constitute
qualifying wages at the time the deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
   (g)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the Municipality until such time as the
withheld amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
   (h)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer shall
file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator listing the
names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all employees from whose
qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been withheld for the
Municipality during the preceding calendar year, the amount of tax withheld, if
any, from each such employee's qualifying wage, the total amount of qualifying
wages paid to such employee during the preceding calendar year, the name of
every other municipal corporation for which tax was withheld or should have
been withheld from such employee during the preceding calendar year, any other
information required for Federal income tax reporting purposes on Internal
Revenue Service form W-2 or its equivalent form with respect to such employee,
and other information as may be required by the Tax Administrator.
   (i)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
   (j)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold Municipal income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under the
employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
   (k)   A Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an employer at
the request of an employee when such tax is not otherwise required to be
withheld by this chapter to be tax required to be withheld and remitted for the
purposes of this section.

municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other

corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's "principal place of work" with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
            For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be deemed in accordance with division

entertainer, or public figure within the Municipality.
      (2)   For the purposes of division (b)(1) of this section, an employee
shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in a municipal
corporation only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on
behalf of the employer in that municipal corporation than in any other
municipal corporation on that day. For the purposes of determining the amount
of time an employee spent in a particular location, the time spent performing
one or more of the following activities shall be considered to have been spent
at the employee's principal place of work:
         A.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
         B.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
         C.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to pick

         E.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
   (c)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in a
municipal corporation that imposes an income tax in accordance with this
chapter, the exception from withholding requirements described in division (b)

during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing
personal services in a municipal corporation exceeds the twenty-day threshold
described in division (b)(1) of this section, the employer shall withhold and
remit tax to that municipal corporation for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in that municipal corporation.
      (2)   An employer required to begin withholding tax for a municipal
corporation under division (d)(1) of this section may elect to withhold tax for
that municipal corporation for the first twenty days on which the employer paid
qualifying wages to the employee for personal services performed in that
municipal corporation.
      (3)   If an employer makes the election described in division (d)(2) of
this section, the taxes withheld and paid by such an employer during those
first twenty days to the municipal corporation in which the employee's
principal place of work is located are refundable to the employee.
   (e)   Without regard to the number of days in a calendar year on which an
employee performs personal services in any municipal corporation, an employer
shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the employee's qualifying wages
for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the municipal corporation in
which the employer's fixed location is located if the employer qualifies as a
small employer as defined in Section
881.03. To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for a
taxable year, a Tax Administrator may require the employer to provide the Tax
Administrator with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding
taxable year.
   (f)   Divisions (b)(1) and (d) of this section shall not apply to the extent
that a Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement regarding the
manner in which the employer shall comply with the requirements of Section
881.051.

      (3)   A Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an alternative
apportionment method as described in division (b)(1) of this section only by
issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period prescribed by Section
881.19(a).
      (4)   Nothing in division (b) of this section nullifies or otherwise

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer;
      (3)   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section
solely in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax
liability. If a Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may
dispute the determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence,
that the Tax Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

taxable year.
      (2)   An individual who is a resident of a municipal corporation that
imposes a Municipal income tax shall report the individual's net profit from
all real estate activity on the individual's annual tax return for that
municipal corporation. The individual may claim a credit for taxes the
individual paid on such net profit to another municipal corporation to the
extent that such credit is allowed under Section
881.081.
   (g)   If, in computing a taxpayer's adjusted Federal taxable income, the
taxpayer deducted any amount with respect to a stock option granted to an
employee, and if the employee is not required to include in the employee's
income any such amount or a portion thereof because it is exempted from
taxation under Section
881.03(c)(11)L. and (c)(34)A.4., by a municipal corporation to which the
taxpayer has apportioned a portion of its net profit the taxpayer shall add the
amount that is exempt from taxation to the taxpayer's net profit that was
apportioned to that municipal corporation. In no case shall a taxpayer be
required to add to its net profit that was apportioned to that municipal
corporation any amount other than the amount upon which the employee would be
required to pay tax were the amount related to the stock option not exempted
from taxation.
         This division applies solely for the purpose of making an adjustment
to the amount of a taxpayer's net profit that was apportioned to a municipal
corporation under this section.

Municipal income tax.
   (c)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall

subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

purpose of making the computations required in Section
881.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit situs to a

the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in

all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
881.062, exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the pass-through
entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit situs to a
municipal corporation;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to Municipal income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
federal taxable income of the affiliated group.

purposes of this section, a payment of estimated taxes on or before any payment
date shall be considered a payment of any previous underpayment only to the
extent the payment of estimated taxes exceeds the amount of the payment
presently required to be paid to avoid any penalty.
   (e)   An underpayment of any portion of tax liability determined under
division (d) of this section shall be due to reasonable cause and the penalty
imposed by this section shall not be added to the taxes for the taxable year if
any of the following apply:

municipality as the Commissioner may require.
   (d)   The Commissioner, or any duly authorized agent or employee, may
exchange information with the Administrator or his or her authorized agent or
employees of other taxing jurisdictions for the purpose of verifying any claim
for credit by City residents, or for the purpose of verifying any claims for
credit of taxes paid to the City by residents of such other taxing
jurisdictions, and may enter into agreements for such purpose.

881.082  REFUNDABLE CREDIT FOR QUALIFYING LOSS.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation plan
described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
      (2)   A.   Except as provided in division (a)(2)B. of this section,
"qualifying loss" means the excess, if any, of the total amount of compensation
the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan over the total amount of income the taxpayer has recognized
for Federal income tax purposes for all taxable years on a cumulative basis as
compensation with respect to the taxpayer's receipt of money and property
attributable to distributions in connection with the nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.
         B.   If, for one or more taxable years, the taxpayer has not paid to
one or more municipal corporations income tax imposed on the entire amount of
compensation the payment of which is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan, then the "qualifying loss" is the product of the
amount resulting from the calculation described in division (a)(2)A. of this
section computed without regard to division (a)(2)B. of this section and a
fraction the numerator of which is the portion of such compensation on which
the taxpayer has paid income tax to one or more municipal corporations and the
denominator of which is the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   With respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the
taxpayer sustains a qualifying loss only in the taxable year in which the
taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the taxable
year for which the taxpayer paid income tax to a municipal corporation with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan. If different
tax rates applied for different taxable years, then the "qualifying tax rate"
is a weighted average of those different tax rates. The weighted average shall
be based upon the tax paid to the municipal corporation each year with respect
to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (d) of this section, a refundable
credit shall be allowed against the income tax imposed by a municipal
corporation for each qualifying loss sustained by a taxpayer during the taxable
year. The amount of the credit shall be equal to the product of the qualifying
loss and the qualifying tax rate.
      (2)   A taxpayer shall claim the credit allowed under this section from
each municipal corporation to which the taxpayer paid Municipal income tax with
respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan in one or more taxable
years.
      (3)   If a taxpayer has paid tax to more than one municipal corporation
with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan, the amount of the
credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal corporation shall be
calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's proportionate share of
the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the taxpayer to all
municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to a
municipal corporation for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
   (c)   (1)   For purposes of this section, municipal corporation income tax
that has been withheld with respect to a nonqualified deferred compensation
plan shall be considered to have been paid by the taxpayer with respect to the
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
      (2)   Any Municipal income tax that has been refunded or otherwise
credited for the benefit of the taxpayer with respect to a nonqualified
deferred compensation plan shall not be considered to have been paid to the
municipal corporation by the taxpayer.
   (d)   The credit allowed under this section is allowed only to the extent
the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:
      (1)   The insolvency or bankruptcy of the employer who had established
the nonqualified deferred compensation plan; or
      (2)   The employee's failure or inability to satisfy all of the
employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.083  CREDIT FOR PERSON WORKING IN JOINT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT OR
ZONE.
   A municipality shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the Municipality who works in a joint economic development zone created
under Ohio R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under
Ohio R.C. 715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit
against its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another
municipal corporation, pursuant to Section
881.081.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.084  CREDIT FOR TAX BEYOND STATUTE FOR OBTAINING REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited or paid to the Municipality, but
should have been deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, is
allowable by the Municipality as a refund, but is subject to the three-year
limitation on refunds as provided in Section
881.096.
   (b)   Income tax that should have been deposited or paid to the
Municipality, but was deposited or paid to another municipal corporation, shall
be subject to collection and recovery by the Municipality. To the extent a
refund of such tax or withholding is barred by the limitation on refunds as
provided in Section
881.096, the Municipality will allow a non-refundable credit equal to the tax
or withholding paid to the other municipality against the income tax the
Municipality claims is due. If the Municipality's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the tax rates is also subject to collection
by the Municipality, along with any penalty and interest accruing during the
period of nonpayment.
   (c)   No carryforward of credit will be permitted when the overpayment is
beyond the three-year limitation for refunding of same as provided in Section
881.096.
   (d)   Nothing in this section requires a municipality to allow credit for
tax paid to another municipal corporation if the municipality has reduced
credit for tax paid to another municipal corporation. Section
881.081 regarding any limitation on credit shall prevail.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.09  ANNUAL RETURN
881.091  RETURN AND PAYMENT OF TAX.
   (a)   (1)   An annual return with respect to the income tax levied on
Municipal taxable income by the Municipality shall be completed and filed by
every taxpayer for any taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, regardless of whether or not income tax is due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer located in the Municipality under Section
881.051(c) when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to

required by the Municipality in accordance with this chapter, the return or

individual's duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other
person charged with the care of the person or property of that individual. Such
duly authorized agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person
charged with the care of the person or property of that individual shall
provide, with the filing of the return, appropriate documentation to support
that they are authorized to file a return or notice on behalf of the taxpayer.
This notice shall include any legally binding authorizations, and contact
information including name, address, and phone number of the duly authorized
agent, guardian, conservator, fiduciary, or other person.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this section shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer, and shall include
the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification number. Each
return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of perjury.
      (2)   A taxpayer who is an individual is required to include, with each
annual return, amended return, or request for refund required under this
section, copies of only the following documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal
Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and Tax Statements," including all information
reported on the taxpayer's Federal W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or
withheld for any municipal corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service

municipal corporation, Ohio IT 1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return
or refund request, any other documentation necessary to support the refund
request or the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual taxpayer
who files the annual return required by this section electronically is not
required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   A taxpayer that is not an individual is required to include, with
each annual net profit return, amended net profit return, or request for refund
required under this section, copies of only the following documents: the
taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form 1065, form 1120, form 1120-

Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or a

method of electronically submitting the documents required under this division
through the Ohio Business Gateway on or before January 1, 2016. The Department
shall transmit all documents submitted electronically under this division to
the appropriate Tax Administrator.
      (5)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator shall
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the Municipality to determine and verify the taxpayer's
Municipal income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of
this section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form
or on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
      (6)   Any other documentation, including schedules, other Municipal
income tax returns, or other supporting documentation necessary to verify
credits, income, losses, or other pertinent factors on the return shall also be
included to avoid delay in processing, or disallowance by the Tax Administrator
of undocumented credits or losses.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division

Administrator.
         C.   In the case of individual income tax return required to be filed
by an individual, and net profit income tax return required to be filed by a
taxpayer who is not an individual, no remittance is required if the amount
shown to be due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the Municipality in accordance with this
chapter, the Tax Administrator may require taxpayers to file returns and make
payments otherwise than as provided in this section, including taxpayers not
otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (3)   With respect to taxpayers to whom Section
881.092 applies, to the extent that any provision in this division conflicts
with any provision in Section
881.092, the provision in Section
881.092 prevails.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the Municipality shall
not require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the Municipality for a
taxable year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the
Municipality an annual net profit return under division (f)(3) and (f)(4) of
this section.
   (i)   This division shall not apply to payments required to be made under
Section
881.051(b)(1)B.
      (1)   If any report, claim, statement, or other document required to be
filed, or any payment required to be made, within a prescribed period or on or
before a prescribed date under this chapter is delivered after that period or
that to the Tax Administrator or other municipal official with which the
report, claim, statement, or other document is required to be filed, or to
which the payment is required to be made, the date of the postmark stamped on
the cover in which the report, claim, statement or other document, or payment
is mailed shall be deemed to be the date of delivery or the date of payment.
"The date of postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the
cover, the earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.
      (2)   If a payment is required to be made by electronic funds transfer,
the payment is considered to be made when the payment is credited to an account
designated by the Tax Administrator for the receipt of tax payments, except
that, when a payment made by electronic funds transfer is delayed due to
circumstances not under the control of the taxpayer, the payment is considered
to be made when the taxpayer submitted the payment. For purposes of this
section, "submitted the payment" means the date which the taxpayer has
designated for the delivery of payment, which may or may not be the same date
as the date the payment was initiated by the taxpayer.
   (j)   The amounts withheld for the Municipality by an employer, the agent of
an employer, or other payer as described in Section
881.051 shall be allowed to the recipient of the compensation as credits
against payment of the tax imposed on the recipient unless the amounts withheld
were not remitted to the Municipality and the recipient colluded with the
employer, agent, or other payer in connection with the failure to remit the
amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the Municipality to be filed in accordance
with this section shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize
another person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to
communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
The return or instructions accompanying the return shall indicate that by
checking the box the taxpayer authorizes the Tax Administrator to contact the
preparer or other person concerning questions that arise during the examination
or other review of the return and authorizes the preparer or other person only
to provide the Tax Administrator with information that is missing from the
return, to contact the Tax Administrator for information about the examination
or other review of the return or the status of the taxpayer's refund or
payments, and to respond to notices about mathematical errors, offsets, or
return preparation that the taxpayer has received from the Tax Administrator
and has shown to the preparer or other person. Authorization by the taxpayer of
another person to communicate with the Tax Administrator about matters
pertaining to the return does not preclude the Tax Administrator from
contacting the taxpayer regarding such matters.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator of the Municipality shall accept for filing a
generic form of any income tax return, report, or document required by the
Municipality in accordance with this chapter, provided that the generic form,
once completed and filed, contains all of the information required by
ordinances, resolutions, or rules adopted by the Municipality or Tax
Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer filing the
generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter and of the
Municipality's ordinance or resolution governing the filing of returns,
reports, or documents.
   (m)   When income tax returns, reports, or other documents require the
signature of a tax return preparer, the Tax Administrator shall accept a
facsimile of such a signature in lieu of a manual signature.
   (n)   (1)   As used in this division, "worksite location" has the same
meaning as in Section
881.052.
      (2)   A person may notify a Tax Administrator that the person does not
expect to be a taxpayer with respect to the municipal corporation for a taxable
year if both of the following conditions apply:
         A.   The person was required to file a tax return with the municipal
corporation for the immediately preceding taxable year because the person
performed services at a worksite location within the municipal corporation, and
the person has filed all appropriate and required returns and remitted all
applicable income tax and withholding payments as provided by this chapter. The
Tax Administrator is not required to accept an affidavit from a taxpayer who
has not complied with the provisions of this chapter.
         B.   The person no longer provides services in the municipal
corporation, and does not expect to be subject to the municipal corporation's
income tax for the taxable year.
               The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the municipal corporation. The affidavit also
shall include the following statement: "The affiant has no plans to perform any
services within the municipal corporation, make any sales in the municipal
corporation, or otherwise become subject to the tax levied by the municipal
corporation during the taxable year. If the affiant does become subject to the
tax levied by the municipal corporation for the taxable year, the affiant
agrees to be considered a taxpayer and to properly register as a taxpayer with
the municipal corporation, if such a registration is required by the municipal
corporation's resolutions, ordinances, or rules." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (n)(2) of
this section, the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file any
tax return for the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses
information that conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described
in the affidavit change, or the taxpayer has engaged in activity which results
in work being performed, services provided, sales made, or other activity that
results in Municipal taxable income reportable to the Municipality in the
taxable year. It shall be the responsibility of the taxpayer to comply with the
provisions of this chapter relating to the reporting and filing of Municipal
taxable income on an annual Municipal income tax return, even if an affidavit
has been filed with the Tax Administrator for the taxable year. Nothing in
division (n) of this section prohibits the Tax Administrator from performing an
audit of the person.

Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as the Tax Administrator
considers appropriate.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the Municipality before the 181st day after the applicant's
active duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (b)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require

file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the Municipality in accordance
with this chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (c)(2)A.
of this section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension
that the taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this
section, "qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member
of a reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to
active duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of
the United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes the payment of which is extended in accordance with
division (c)(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension

the extension period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax
Administrator shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator
shall not include any period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of
this section in calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (d)   For each taxable year to which division (a), (b), or (c) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (b)(2) and (b)(3) or
(c) of this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the
filing status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that

(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.093  USE OF OHIO BUSINESS GATEWAY; TYPES OF FILINGS AUTHORIZED.
   (a)   Any taxpayer subject to Municipal income taxation with respect to the
taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file any Municipal
income tax return or, estimated Municipal income tax return, or extension for

amount of Municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
   (c)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns or deposit of any required tax.
   (d)   The use of the Ohio Business Gateway by municipal corporations,

Municipal income tax matter, except as otherwise specifically provided by law.
   (e)   Nothing in this section shall be construed as limiting or removing the
authority of any municipal corporation to administer, audit, and enforce the
provisions of its Municipal income tax.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.094  EXTENSION OF TIME TO FILE.
   (a)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month extension
for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall automatically receive
an extension for the filing of a Municipal income tax return. The extended due
date of the Municipal income tax return shall be the fifteenth day of the tenth
month after the last day of the taxable year to which the return relates.
   (b)   Any taxpayer that qualifies for an automatic Federal extension for a
period other than six-months for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax
return shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal

for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may request that the Tax
Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month extension of the date for filing
the taxpayer's Municipal income tax return, if the request is received by the
Tax Administrator on or before the date the Municipal income tax return is due,
the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's requested extension.
   (d)   An extension of time to file under this chapter is not an extension of
the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator grants an extension of
that date.
   (e)   If the State Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of a Municipal

881.095  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   A taxpayer shall file an amended return with the Tax
Administrator in such form as the Tax Administrator requires if any of the
facts, figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual
return to determine the tax due levied by the Municipality in accordance with
this chapter must be altered.
      (2)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's municipal tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended municipal return showing income subject

overpayment is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (3)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, such amount need not accompany the amended return.
Except as provided under division (b)(2) of this section, the amended return
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a
previously filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly,
by the adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless
the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or prosecutions under
Section
881.19 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were

that division. If the amount of the refund is ten dollars ($10.00) or less, no
refund need be paid by the Municipality to the taxpayer. Except as set forth in

claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations to only those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
881.096.  Except as set forth in division (c)(2) of this section, the request
shall not reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments that are
not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened.

agents of employers, other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or
withholding tax levied by the Municipality:
      (1)   Overpayments of more than ten dollars ($10.00);
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested exceeds ten
dollars ($10.00).
   (b)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, returns setting
forth a request for refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, within
three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever is later. Any
documentation that substantiates the taxpayer's claim for a refund must be
included with the return filing. Failure to remit all documentation, including
schedules, other municipal income tax returns, or other supporting
documentation necessary to verify credits, income, losses or other pertinent
factors on the return will cause delay in processing, and/or disallowance of
undocumented credits or losses.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount to the appropriate
municipal corporation official for payment. Except as provided in division (b)
(3) of this section, the Administrator shall issue an assessment to any
taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or partially denied. The assessment
shall state the amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the
denial, and instructions for appealing the assessment.
      (3)   If a Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund request
included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax return, the
Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the amount of the
refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for
requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
881.18.
   (c)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (b) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (d)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
881.10(a)(4).

alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator, if a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers

not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not an attorney.

to the Municipality that arises pursuant to the Municipal income tax imposed in
accordance with this chapter.
   (b)   The Tax Administrator may do either of the following if such action is
in the best interests of the Municipality:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments, upon such terms and

compromise or agreement, and shall not extinguish or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   (1)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a
claim shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement
or if the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation
of a material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement
and that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would
have accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to
accrue and be due.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall have sole discretion to determine
whether or not penalty, interest, charges or applicable fees will be assessed
through the duration of any compromise or payment-over-time agreement.
   (f)   The Tax Administrator may require that the taxpayer provide detailed
financial documentation and information, in order to determine whether or not a
payment-over-time agreement will be authorized. The taxpayer's failure to
provide the necessary and required information by the Tax Administrator shall
preclude consideration of a payment-over-time agreement.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.133  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; RIGHT TO EXAMINE.
   (a)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee thereof may
examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns of
any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or that the Tax
Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this chapter for the
purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no return was
filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter. Upon written request by the
Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee thereof, every
employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is required to
furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized agent, or
employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and Federal
and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated in the
request.
   (b)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that a Tax Administrator believes is subject to,
the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator of a municipal corporation may require any person, by notice
served on that person, to keep such records as the Tax Administrator determines
necessary to show whether or not that person is liable, and the extent of such
liability, for the income tax levied by the Municipality or for the withholding
of such tax.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the Tax
Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that was

such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any such
person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books, papers,
records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's possession
or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an attorney,
accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing or
examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person
who is not an attorney.
   (d)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal and State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.

include the person's Social Security number, Federal employer identification

person required by the Tax Administrator to provide identifying information
that has experienced any change with respect to that information shall notify
the Tax Administrator of the change before, or upon, filing the next tax
document requiring the identifying information.
   (b)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
881.10, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
881.99.
      (2)   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under division (a) of this section
within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
881.10.
      (3)   The penalties provided for under divisions (b)(1) and (b)(2) of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
881.99 for a violation of Section
881.15 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.14  CONFIDENTIALITY.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,

shall access or disclose such information except in accordance with a proper
judicial order or in connection with the performance of that person's official
duties or the official business of the Municipality as authorized by Ohio R.C.
Chapter 718 or the charter or ordinance authorizing the levy. The Tax
Administrator of the Municipality or a designee thereof may furnish copies of
returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and other related tax
information to the Internal Revenue Service, the State Tax Commissioner, and
Tax Administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the Municipality from publishing or
disclosing statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect
to particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.15  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation

claim, or document authorized or required by municipal corporation ordinance or
State law to be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure,
counsel, or advise the preparation or presentation of such report, return,

does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator as to whether or how certain income, source of income, or a
certain activity or transaction will be taxed. The written response of the Tax
Administrator shall be an "opinion of the Tax Administrator" and shall bind the
Tax Administrator, in accordance with divisions (c), (g), and (h) of this
section, provided all of the following conditions are satisfied:
      (1)   The taxpayer's request fully and accurately describes the specific
facts or circumstances relevant to a determination of the taxability of the
income, source of income, activity, or transaction, and, if an activity or
transaction, all parties involved in the activity or transaction are clearly
identified by name, location, or other pertinent facts.
      (2)   The request relates to a tax imposed by the Municipality in
accordance with this chapter.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator's response is signed by the Tax Administrator
and designated as an "opinion of the Tax Administrator."

protect the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and who reasonably
relies on it from liability for any taxes, penalty, or interest otherwise
chargeable on the activity or transaction specifically held by the Tax
Administrator's opinion to be taxable in a particular manner or not to be
subject to taxation for any taxable years that may be specified in the opinion,
or until the earliest of the following dates:
      (1)   The effective date of a written revocation by the Tax Administrator
sent to the taxpayer by certified mail, return receipt requested. The effective
date of the revocation shall be the taxpayer's date of receipt or one year
after the issuance of the opinion, whichever is later;
      (2)   The effective date of any amendment or enactment of a relevant
section of the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified State law, or the Municipality's
income tax ordinance that would substantially change the analysis and
conclusion of the opinion of the Tax Administrator;
      (3)   The date on which a court issues an opinion establishing or
changing relevant case law with respect to the Ohio Revised Code, uncodified
State law, or the Municipality's income tax ordinance;
      (4)   If the opinion of the Tax Administrator was based on the
interpretation of Federal law, the effective date of any change in the relevant
Federal statutes or regulations, or the date on which a court issues an opinion
establishing or changing relevant case law with respect to Federal statutes or
regulations;
      (5)   The effective date of any change in the taxpayer's material facts
or circumstances;
      (6)   The effective date of the expiration of the opinion, if specified
in the opinion.
   (d)   (1)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
      (2)   If the taxpayer knowingly has misrepresented the pertinent facts or
omitted material facts with intent to defraud the Municipality in order to
obtain a more favorable opinion, the taxpayer may be in violation of Section
881.15.
   (e)   If a Tax Administrator provides written advice under this section, the
opinion shall include a statement that:
      (1)   The tax consequences stated in the opinion may be subject to change

received under this section.
   (g)   This section binds a Tax Administrator only with respect to opinions
of the Tax Administrator issued on or after January 1, 2016.
   (h)   An opinion of a Tax Administrator binds that Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (i)   A Tax Administrator shall make available the text of all opinions
issued under this section, except those opinions prepared for a taxpayer who
has requested that the text of the opinion remain confidential. In no event
shall the text of an opinion be made available until the Tax Administrator has
removed all information that identifies the taxpayer and any other parties
involved in the activity or transaction.
   (j)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section or a
refusal to offer an opinion under division (f) of this section may not be

(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.17  ASSESSMENT; APPEAL BASED ON PRESUMPTION OF DELIVERY.
   (a)   (1)   The Tax Administrator shall serve an assessment either by
personal service, by certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under
Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator may deliver the assessment through
alternative means as provided in this section, including, but not limited to,
delivery by secure electronic mail. Such alternative delivery method must be
authorized by the person subject to the assessment.
      (3)   Once service of the assessment has been made by the Tax
Administrator or other municipal official, or the designee of either, the
person to whom the assessment is directed may protest the ruling of that
assessment by filing an appeal with the Local Board of Tax Review within sixty
days after the receipt of service. The delivery of an assessment of the Tax
Administrator as prescribed in Ohio R.C. 718.18 is prima facie evidence that
delivery is complete and that the assessment is served.
   (b)   (1)   A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and service
as set forth in this division. A person disputing the presumption of delivery
and service under this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance
of the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent was not an
address with which the person was associated at the time the Tax Administrator
originally mailed the assessment by certified mail. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (b)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other municipal
official, or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division
prevents the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a
compromise with the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal
with the Local Board of Tax Review.
(Ord. 2015-27.  Passed 11-5-15.)
881.18  LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW; APPEAL TO LOCAL BOARD OF TAX REVIEW.
   (a)   (1)   The legislative authority of the Municipality shall maintain a
Local Board of Tax Review to hear appeals as provided in Ohio R.C. Chapter 718.
      (2)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall consist of three members.  The
three members of the Local Board of Tax Review must be domiciled in the
Municipality.  Two members shall be appointed by the legislative authority of
the Municipality, and may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors
with the Municipality at any time during their term or in the five years
immediately preceding the date of appointment. One member shall be appointed by
the top administrative official of the Municipality. This member may be an
employee of the Municipality, but may not be the director of finance or
equivalent officer, or the Tax Administrator or other similar official or an
employee directly involved in municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate
thereof.
      (3)   The term for members of the Local Board of Tax Review appointed by
the legislative authority of the Municipality shall be two years. There is no
limit on the number of terms that a member may serve should the member be
reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the top
administrative official of the Municipality shall serve at the discretion of
the administrative official.
      (4)   Members of the Board of Tax Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority as set forth in Ohio R.C.

qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (6)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the board shall impair the power and
authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the board.
      (7)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the board due to a
conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the legislative
authority or top administrative official that appointed the member shall
appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the board in the member's
place. This appointment shall be subject to the same requirements and
limitations as are applicable to the appointment of the member temporarily
unable to serve.
      (8)   No member of the Local Board of Tax Review shall receive
compensation, fee, or reimbursement of expenses for service on the board.
      (9)   A member of a Local Board of Tax Review shall not be appointed to
or serve on another such board simultaneously.
   (b)   Whenever a Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed,
and to whom the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the board by filing a request with the board. The request shall be in
writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the assessment should be
deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within sixty days after the
taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Local Board of Tax Review shall schedule a hearing to be held
within sixty days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c)
of this section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or
waives a hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may
appear before the board and/or may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The board may allow a
hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a case,
the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The board may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax Administrator's
assessment or any part of that assessment. The board shall issue a final
determination on the appeal within ninety days after the board's final hearing
on the appeal, and send a copy of its final determination by ordinary mail to
all of the parties to the appeal within fifteen days after issuing the final
determination. The taxpayer or the Tax Administrator may appeal the board's
final determination as provided in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section shall
adopt rules governing its procedures, including a schedule of related costs,
and shall keep a record of its transactions. The rules governing the Local
Board of Tax Review procedures shall be in writing, and may be amended as
needed by the Local Board of Tax Review. Such records are not public records
available for inspection under Ohio R.C. 149.43.  For this reason, any
documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or working
papers for each case must be maintained in a secure location under the control
of the Tax Administrator. No member of the Local Board of Tax Review may remove
such documentation, copies of returns or reports, final determinations, or
working papers from the hearing. Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a
Local Board of Tax Review created pursuant to this section are not meetings of
a public body subject to Ohio R.C. 121.22.  For this reason, such hearings
shall not be open to the public, and only those parties to the case may be
present during the hearing.

period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with a Local Board of Tax Review the request described in Section
881.18.  That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding,

Review with which the aggrieved person filed the request did not have
jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of that
assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the

the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the Municipality does not prejudice
any claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Local Board of Tax Review created
under Section
881.18, of the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of
the Ohio Board of Tax Appeals has been appealed, so that the amount due from
the party assessed under the corrected assessment is less than the amount paid,
there shall be issued to the appellant or to the appellant's assigns or legal
representative a refund in the amount of the overpayment as provided by Section
881.098, with interest on that amount as provided by division (d) of this
section.

   As used in this chapter, unless otherwise distinctly expressed:
   (a)   "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture,
association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company,
corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any
other group or combination acting as a unit.
   (b)   "Clerk-Treasurer" means the Finance and Revenue Director of the City.
   (c)   "Hotel or motel" means every establishment kept, used, maintained,
advertised or held out to the public to be a place where sleeping
accommodations are offered for a consideration to guests and in which five or
more rooms are used for the accommodation of such guests, whether such rooms
are in one or several structures.
   (d)   "Transient guest" means a person occupying a room for sleeping
accommodations for less than thirty consecutive days.
   (e)   "Rent" means the consideration received for occupancy valued in money,
whether received in money or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits

occupant is liable for the occupancy without any deduction therefrom.
   (f)   "Operator" means any person who is the proprietor of the hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, licensee or any other capacity. Where
the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or
character, other than an employee, the managing agent shall be deemed an
operator for the purposes of this chapter, and shall have the same duties and

or private dining rooms, or exhibit, sample or display space shall not be
considered occupancy within the meaning of this definition unless the person
exercising occupancy uses or possesses, or has the right to use or possess, all
or any portion of such room or suite of rooms for dwelling, lodging or sleeping
purposes.
(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)
882.02  PURPOSE; LEVY OF TAX; PRESUMPTIONS.
   (a)   For the purpose of providing revenue with which to provide for
economic development, community promotion and any lawful Municipal purpose, and

transactions by which lodging by a hotel is or is to be furnished to transient
guests.
   (b)   The tax is three percent of the amount paid or to be paid by the
transient guest for the lodging. The tax applies and is collectable at the time
the lodging is furnished, regardless of the time when the price is paid.
   (c)   For the purpose of the proper administration of this chapter, and to
prevent the evasion of the tax, it is presumed that all lodging furnished by
hotels, motels or transient accommodations in the Municipality to transient
guests is subject to the tax until the contrary is established.

to the operator, and each operator shall collect from the transient guest the
full and exact amount of the tax payable on each taxable lodging.
   (b)   If the transaction is claimed to be exempt, the transient guest must
furnish to the operator, and the operator must obtain from the transient guest,
a certificate specifying the reason that the sale is not legally subject to the
tax. If no certificate is obtained, it shall be presumed that the tax applies.
(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)
882.06  EVIDENCE OF PAYMENT; OPERATOR'S FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY; ADVERTISING.
   (a)   Businesses filing tax returns under this chapter may claim an

invoices which relate to advertising in order to claim this credit.
(Ord. 94-11.  Passed 1-27-94.)
   (b)   The tax to be collected shall be stated and charged separately from

(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)

882.08  RECORDS.
   Each operator shall keep complete and accurate records of lodging furnished,
together with a record of the tax collected thereon, which shall be the amount
due under this chapter and shall keep all invoices and other pertinent
documents. If the operator furnishes lodging not subject to the tax, the
operator's records shall show the identity of the transient guest, if the sale
was exempted by reason of such identity, or the nature of the transaction, if
exempted for any other reason. Such records and other documents shall be opened
during business hours to the inspection of the Clerk-Treasurer and shall be
preserved for a period of four years, unless the Clerk-Treasurer, in writing,
consents to their destruction within that period, or by any order requests that
such records be kept for a longer period of time.
(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)
882.09  RETURNS; REMITTANCE OF TAX; CONFIDENTIALITY.

received and the amount of tax collected by transient occupancies. All claims
for exemption from the tax filed by occupants with the operator during the
reporting period shall be filed with the report. At the time the return is
filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Clerk-
Treasurer. The Clerk-Treasurer may establish shorter reporting periods for any
certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of
the tax and he may require further information in the return if such
information is pertinent to the collection of the tax. Returns and payments are
due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected
by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of
the Village until payment thereof is made to the Clerk-Treasurer. All returns
and payments submitted by each operator shall be treated as confidential by the
Clerk-Treasurer and shall not be released by him except upon order of a court
of competent jurisdiction or to an officer or agent of the United States, the
State, the County or the Village for official use only.
(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)
882.10  DELINQUENCY; PENALTIES AND INTEREST.
   (a)   Original Delinquency.  Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed
by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty equal to ten
percent of the amount of the tax, in addition to the tax.
   (b)   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent
remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the
remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty equal
to ten percent of the amount of the tax and the previous penalty in addition to
the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. An additional penalty equal
to ten percent of the total tax and penalty of the previous thirty-day period
shall be added for each successive thirty-day period that the occupant remains
delinquent.
   (c)   Fraud. If the Clerk-Treasurer determines that the nonpayment of any
remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty equal to twenty-
five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the
penalties stated in subsections (a) and (b) hereof.
   (d)   Interest.  In addition to the previous penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first
became delinquent until paid.
   (e)   Penalties During Pendency of Hearing of Appeal. No penalty provided
under the terms of this chapter shall be imposed during the pendency of any
hearing provided for herein, nor during the pendency of any appeal to the
Clerk-Treasurer provided for herein.
(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)
882.11  ESTIMATES BY CLERK-TREASURER; HEARINGS.
   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the
time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any
portion thereof required by this chapter, the Clerk-Treasurer shall proceed in
such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to
base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Clerk-Treasurer procures such
facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment
of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed
or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and
penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it
personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of business. Such
operator may, within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice, make
application in writing to the Clerk-Treasurer for a hearing on the amount
assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the
time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the
Clerk-Treasurer shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and
payable. If such application is made, the Clerk-Treasurer shall give not less
than five days written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator
to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why such amount
specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At
such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified
tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the
Clerk-Treasurer shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall
thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of
such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The
amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an
appeal is taken as provided in this chapter.
(Ord. 74-68. Passed 10-10-74.)
882.12  APPEALS.
   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the Clerk-Treasurer with respect
to the amount of tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the Clerk-
Treasurer by filing a notice of appeal with him within fifteen days of the
serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The Clerk-Treasurer shall
fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and shall give notice in writing
to such operator at his last known place of business. The findings of the
Clerk-Treasurer shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the

(Ord. 96-4.  Passed 2-8-96.)
888.02  GUIDELINES.
   The following Enterprise Zone Guidelines are hereby adopted by and for the
City for the purpose of encouraging investment and the creation of jobs within
the Enterprise Zone in the City:
CITY OF NORTHWOOD ENTERPRISE ZONE GUIDELINES
INTRODUCTION
In an effort to encourage investment in the City's industrial base, the City of
Northwood has designated an Enterprise Zone pursuant to State law.  An
Enterprise Zone is an area within which special tax incentives may be offered
by contract to businesses that agree to invest in capital improvements and
create or retain jobs.  Tax incentives will be offered provided program
guidelines are met and a substantial investment is made.  Jobs must be either
created or retained.  Each contract with a business within the Zone relating to
jobs, investment and tax incentives must be submitted to the City for its
approval.
PURPOSE
The purpose of the Enterprise Zone is to encourage as much investment and job
creation as possible within the boundaries of the Enterprise Zone.  Retaining
jobs is also a priority.  Each contract negotiated with a local business shall
be designed to encourage capital investments while creating or retaining jobs. 
In return, the City of Northwood will agree to provide only the amount of tax
incentives necessary under the circumstances of each transaction to allow the
project to go forward.
ELIGIBLE BUSINESSES
Only those businesses that are "qualified by financial responsibility and
business experience to create and preserve employment opportunities in the Zone
and to improve the economic climate of the municipal corporation..." (Ohio R.C.
5709.63(A)) may apply for the tax incentives available.  Furthermore, only
businesses engaged in manufacturing, warehousing, research and development and
distribution will be eligible to apply for tax incentives.  No housing,
commercial (retail) or institutional uses may benefit from the Enterprise Zone
Program.
INCENTIVES OFFERED
In order to maximize the collection of new tax revenues, only the minimum
abatement necessary to bring about the investment will be offered.  The
incentives that can be offered are only in terms of new real and personal
property related to the specific project.  State law permits up to seventy-five
percent abatement for a period of up to ten years in a municipal corporation. 
The level of incentives can be "stepped" to allow for a higher initial
incentive level.  However, the average incentive level can be a maximum of
sixty percent for the term of the agreement.  In very unusual circumstances,
the municipal corporation can offer tax incentives in excess of seventy-five
percent, but these incentives must be approved by the local school board. 
Optional services or assistance may be provided to a prospective business by
the municipality or county for a period of up to ten years, as well.
EXPANDED INCENTIVES
The Ohio Enterprise Zone law allows a local government to expand the potential
incentives to include existing taxable assets in only two particular
situations.
1.   If a business plans to purchase and operate a large manufacturing
operation that has employed an average of 1,000 employees per year during the
past five years, which operation has closed or has announced closure
proceedings, the local government may grant an exemption of up to 100 percent
of the existing real and personal property for up to ten years.
2.   If a business agrees to remediate an environmentally-contaminated
facility, expending at least 250 percent of the existing value of the facility
on a new investment project, including at least a ten percent investment on
remediation activities, then the local government can exempt up to fifty
percent of the existing real property and 100 percent of the new real and
personal property investment described as the project.
INCOME TAX SHARING
Substitute Senate Bill 19 (SSB 19), which became effective July 22, 1994,
requires that all tax incentive negotiations with companies generating one
million dollars ($1,000,000) or more of new annual payroll, and located within
a municipal corporation which imposes a local income tax, must include a
compensation agreement with the Board of Education of the affected school
district having jurisdiction over the project site.  If the municipal
corporation and the Board of Education cannot reach an agreement within six
months of the formal legislative approval of the Enterprise Zone Agreement,
then the Board of Education shall be compensated with fifty percent of the
local income tax generated by the new employees.  Procedures to arrive at this
compensation agreement are defined in Exhibit A, attached to Ordinance 96-4,
passed February 8, 1996.
SCHOOL BOARD NOTIFICATION
House Bill (HB) 627 has been passed by the Ohio Legislature.  Among many other
issues, the Bill changes the required notice period to boards of education
where the incentive package exceeds the statutory limits.  The notice period is
changed from thirty calendar days to forty-five working days.  This change
affects not only the Enterprise Zone Program, but also the Urban Renewal,
Impacted Cities, "new" Community Reinvestment Area and Tax Increment Financing
Programs.  The new legislation gives the affected Board of Education the
express ability to waive the notice provision or to approve the project which
would end the notice period prospectively.  HB 627 was approved as emergency
legislation and takes effect immediately upon the Governor's signature, which
is expected within the next week.  Local jurisdictions considering tax
exemption packages which exceed the statutory cap should implement the new
notice provision on all pending projects to avoid compliance controversy.  ODOD
will be updating the Enterprise Zone Program Manual and provide Enterprise Zone
Managers a detailed summary of the revision within the near future.
GENERAL APPLICATION PROCESS
An application for Enterprise Zone benefits will be processed through the
following steps:
1.   The company must file an application with the Enterprise Zone Manager on a
form provided by the Office.  A one-time fee of five hundred dollars ($500.00),
made payable to the Ohio Department of Development, is to be submitted with the
Proposed Agreement Between Local Government or County and Enterprise.
2.   After the Enterprise Zone Manager determines that the project is eligible,
the negotiation team will meet and recommend an abatement level and tax sharing
agreement, if required.
3.   Based on the recommendation of the negotiation team, a proposed Enterprise
Zone Agreement will be prepared and submitted to Council for approval. 
Required notice shall be provided to the Board(s) of Education prior to Council
action.
4.   The proposed Agreement, after being approved by Council, will be submitted
to the County Commissioners for approval, again with appropriate notice to the
Board(s) of Education.  County Commissioners action on a proposed Agreement may
be provided to the Boards of Education.  A single notice of both the dates of
the proposed Council action and the proposed County Commissioners action on a
proposed Agreement may be provided to the Boards of Education.
5.   Upon approval of the proposed Agreement by both the City and the County,
an executed agreement will be sent to the Ohio Departments of Development and
Taxation within fifteen days.
6.   The project will be reviewed annually by the Tax Incentive Review Council
(TIRC) for conformance with the Agreement.  The enterprise zone manager will
provide staff assistance for the TIRC in obtaining and reviewing necessary
facts as to conformance with the Agreement.  An annual processing fee may be
required.  Failure to comply with the Agreement may result in the loss of
approved incentives granted.

1222.05(1)
1040.01  EXTENSION OF LINES; ABUTTING AND ADJACENT AREAS.
   Consideration shall be given to the extension of local water lines and water
service in various areas in the Village only upon presentation to Council of
petitions for the same which have been signed by a substantial number of the
property owners in a given area. In the consideration of such petitions, if the
Village is advised by its Engineer that it would be feasible and economical to
include areas abutting upon or reasonably adjacent to an area for which
petitions have been filed, the project may be extended to include such abutting
or adjacent areas without the filing of petitions.
(Res. 67-24A. Passed 11-16-67.)
1040.02  COSTS; CONTRIBUTION OF VILLAGE.
   As to any area seeking the extension of water lines which is represented by
petitions signed by the owners of sixty percent or more of the property
abutting upon the route of the proposed extension, the basic contribution of
the Village shall be limited to two per cent of the overall cost of the
proposed improvement; if no petitions have been filed for a given area or
section of a proposed extension or if the petitions are not signed by the
owners of at least sixty percent of the property abutting upon the route of the
proposed extension, the basic contribution of the Village shall be two percent
of the overall cost of the proposed improvement plus the cost of intersections.
Where it is deemed advisable for purposes of future extensions to install water
lines with greater diameters than immediately necessary to service the areas
involved in a given project, the excessive cost of materials thus resulting
shall be contributed by either the Village or by Wood County.
(Res. 67-24A. Passed 11-16-67.)
1040.03  SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS IN GENERAL.
   All water line extensions shall be financed by special assessments on the
lots and lands bounding and abutting upon the route of the proposed extensions,
assessed upon the basis of front footage, for which purpose the assessable
portion of the improvement shall be the overall cost thereof, less the
contribution of the Village and any contribution by County, State or Federal
agencies. In computing the assessable frontage of lots and lands, as to any
property located at an intersection or where more than one side of a parcel
fronts on the route of the proposed extension, the side with the shorter length
shall be deemed the front of such parcel and shall be assessed for the full
frontage but the other side or sides shall be deemed side frontage and the
first 200 feet thereof shall be excluded from assessment; for such purposes,
land shall be considered in such parcels as determined for real estate tax
purposes.
(Res. 67-24A. Passed 11-16-67.)
1040.04  SPECIAL ASSESSMENTS; DEFERRED PAYMENTS.
   As to lands which are zoned agricultural under the Zoning Code from time to
time and which are undeveloped and unused other than for agricultural purposes
or residential use in connection therewith as of the time of assessment for
water line extensions abutting such parcels, a portion of the special
assessments on such parcels may be deferred, if so elected by the owner
thereof, upon the following basis:
   (a)   For the purposes hereof, a parcel of land shall be as so determined
for real estate tax purposes and each parcel shall be considered as a single
unit irrespective of ownership of other parcels within the assessable area by
the same owner;
   (b)   For purposes of immediate assessment, the assessable frontage of such
parcels shall be limited to 300 feet maximum except that if the frontage
actually used, improved and developed for residential use exceeds 300 feet, the
assessable frontage shall be that frontage actually so used, as determined by
the Street Commissioner and certified to the person charged with the duty of
preparing the special assessment rolls;
   (c)   The assessment on the portion of frontage of such parcels not subject
to immediate assessment as above provided shall be deferred and the amount of
all such deferred assessments shall be paid into the project fund by the
Village. The period of such deferment shall be for a maximum of ten years after
the adoption of the assessment ordinance or such time as such property is
developed for other uses and application is made for a water tap to serve such
property, whichever occurs sooner. The amount of the deferred assessment shall
be reimbursed to the Village by a surcharge on the water tap fee, as provided
in Section
1040.05;
   (d)   The privilege of deferred assessments as herein provided shall not be
made avail able for any projects as to which the deferred assessments as herein
provided would exceed thirty percent of the overall project cost and, further,
such privileges shall be extended only to the extent that sufficient funds are
available from time to time in the Water Tap and Line Extension Fund, as
hereinafter provided.
(Res. 67-24A. Passed 11-16-67. )
1040.05  TAP CHARGES AND SURCHARGES; WATER TAP AND LINE EXTENSION FUND;
APPROPRIATION.
   Rules and regulations respecting taps into the local water lines shall be
promulgated from time to time and made available, the same to be consistent
with the requirements of the source supplying the water service and any
additional requirements adopted from time to time by the Village. The standard
tap charge shall be such amount as determined from time to time by the source
supplying the water service, together with any additional charge imposed from
time to time by the Village for actual services rendered in processing
applications for water taps, for inspection and other related services.
Respecting water taps to serve any parcels which have had the benefit of
deferred assessments, as provided in Section 1040.04, the owner of such parcels
may apply for a water tap to serve any portion thereof up to an aggregate of
300 foot frontage without additional charge. As to water taps to serve a
portion of such parcels exceeding an aggregate of 300 foot frontage, a
surcharge shall be paid computed upon the basis of the number of front feet to
be served which exceed 300 front feet, multiplied by the per foot assessment
which has been deferred. All standard tap charges and surcharges resulting from
deferred assessments shall be paid into a Water Tap and Line Extension Fund,
which is hereby created, the same to serve as a rotary fund out of which the
Village shall pay the amounts of the deferred assessments from time to time. To
initiate such Fund, there is hereby appropriated from the Capital Improvement
Fund the sum of thirteen thousand dollars ($13, 000) and any future
appropriations thereto shall be by separately enacted resolutions to a maximum

(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.03  NECESSITY FOR CHARGES.
   It is hereby determined necessary for the protection of public health,
safety, and welfare, and to conform with Federal, State, and local laws and
regulations, that a system of charges for storm water service be established
which allocates the cost of providing storm water service to each user in such
a manner that the allocated costs are proportionate to the cost of providing
storm water service to that user, insofar as those costs can reasonably be
determined.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.04  POWERS OF CITY ADMINISTRATOR.
   Storm water service charges levied pursuant to this chapter shall be
collected by the Provider of Public Utilities. The City Administrator shall
make and enforce such rules and regulations as deemed necessary for the safe,
economical and efficient management and protection of the City's storm water
system; for the construction and use of storm sewers and connections to the
storm water system consistent with policies established by the City Council;
and for the regulation, collection, rebating and refunding of such storm water
charges. The City Administrators shall report to City Council and the citizens
of Northwood every six months as to the financial status of the Storm Water
Fund. This report shall include all receipts, expenditures, projects completed
and projects planned over the next reporting period.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.05  RATE STRUCTURE.
   (a)   A storm water service charge shall be billed to the owner of each and
every lot and parcel of land within the City that contains impervious area and
contributes directly or indirectly to the storm water system of the City. This
charge is necessary to pay for the repair, replacement, planning, improvement,
operation, regulation and maintenance of the existing and future City storm
water system. This charge is not related to water and/or sewer service and
applies whether or not the premises are occupied.
   (b)   All properties having impervious area within the City will be assigned
an Equivalent Residential Unit (ERU) or a multiple thereof, with all properties
having any impervious area receiving at least one ERU as follows:
      (1)   All residential properties, as defined in Section
1046.02, will be assigned one ERU. A flat rate will apply to all residential
properties. In cases where an inequitable result occurs due to multiple lots
being assessed to a landowner, an application for a discount would be valid
upon written approval by the City Engineer and the City Administrator.
      (2)   All nonresidential properties, as defined in Section
1046.02, will be assigned an ERU multiple, based upon the properties'
individually measured impervious area (in square feet) divided by 2,500 square
feet (one ERU) but in no event less than one ERU. This division will be
calculated to the first decimal place and rounded according to mathematical
convention.
   (c)   The storm water charge shall be $0.1039 per day per ERU, which amounts
to an average of three dollars and sixteen cents ($3.16) per month. Owners of
nonresidential property may be eligible for a storm water management discount,
which would be a charge of $0.0832 per day per ERU, which amounts to an average
of two dollars and fifty-three cents ($2.53) per month. An application for a
discount would be valid upon written approval by the City Engineer and the City
Administrator.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.06  STORM WATER ONLY ACCOUNTS.
   Storm water only accounts are properties that do not utilize water and/or
sanitary sewer services but do contain impervious area or hard surface and
contribute directly or indirectly to the City's storm water system as
determined by the Director. A copy of every permit issued by any City division
for new construction that does not utilize water and/or sanitary sewer services
shall be sent to the City Administrators for a determination of whether or not
storm water service charges apply.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.07  BILLINGS AND TERMS OF PAYMENT.
   (a)   The storm water charges established under this chapter shall be due
and payable to the City on the date noted on the bill provided by the Provider
of Public Utilities, or by the City if Section
1046.06 applies.
   (b)   In the event the amount billed for storm water service is not paid in
full on or before the due date noted on the bill, an amount equal to 5% of the
amount billed shall be added. Such 5% charge shall be due and payable in
addition to the total amount noted on the bill, including but not limited to,
arrearages, administrative charges, deposits, deferrals and local charges.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.08  COLLECTION.
   When charges for storm water service are not paid when due, the Director
may:
   (a)   Terminate water service to the property pursuant to existing written
policy;
   (b)   Forward the account for collection by an outside collection agency;
   (c)   Transfer the delinquency to any other property owned by the account
holder that receives service from the Department of Public Utilities;
   (d)   Bring an action at law for the collection of the delinquent amount;
   (e)   Certify the charges, together with any penalties, to the County
Auditor, who shall place the certified amount on the real property tax
duplicate of the property served directly or indirectly by the storm water
system of the City. The amount certified shall be a lien on the property,
served from the date placed on the list and duplicate, and shall be collected
in the same manner as other taxes, except that, notwithstanding the Ohio
Revised Code, a county treasurer shall accept a payment in such amount when
separately tendered as payment for the full amount of such unpaid storm water
charges and associated penalties.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.09  ADJUSTMENTS.
   Increase (debit) adjustments can be made to nonresidential service charges
by property owners adding additional impervious area such as rooftops, parking
lots, driveways and walkways. Decrease (credit) adjustments can be made to
nonresidential service charges by property owners performing activities that
reduce the impact of storm water runoff to the storm water system.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)
1046.10  RIGHT TO APPEAL.
   (a)   A nonresidential property owner may challenge the ERU multiple
assigned his or her property by filing an appeal with the City Administrator
for adjustment thereof, stating in writing the grounds for the appeal. The
Manager shall cause appropriate investigation thereof and report the findings
to the property owner. The Manager shall consider the appeal and determine
whether an adjustment of the ERU multiple for any such lot or parcel is
necessary, and adjust such ERU multiple if appropriate.
   (b)   If the property owner is not satisfied with the findings, an
administrative hearing may be requested. At the hearing, both the property
owner and the City Administrator may present evidence to a hearing examiner.
After consideration, the hearing examiner shall issue a written decision to the
parties, which shall be the final decision of the Department of Public
Utilities.
(Ord. 2001-3.  Passed 11-19-01.)

practices, acceptable to Northwood, to control the discharge of pollutants and
volume of flow in such discharges.

for all solid waste generated by the City for the remainder of the thirteen-
year period. If the disposal facility is more than fifteen miles from the City,
Evergreen Landfill shall pay for the hauling of solid waste to such site.

license fee for all trucks depositing hazardous waste at the Landfill.
   (i)   Evergreen Landfill shall continue to operate and maintain the
equipment presently being installed at the Landfill site to assure that mud or
other debris or hazardous substances are not tracked out onto the road right of

operations at the Landfill, whenever any claim is made or whenever any
liability is said to have commenced or accrued. The owner/operator shall post a
fifty thousand dollar ($50, 000) surety bond as partial security for such
agreement or shall furnish the City with a certificate of insurance
demonstrating at least fifty thousand dollars ($50,000) in liability insurance
covering such risk, but the amount of the bond or insurance shall not be
construed in any way to limit the indemnity obligation as stated herein.
   (l)   These imposed conditions shall be covenants and shall run with the
land being used as the sanitary and/or hazardous waste Landfill and shall apply
to Ohio Waste Management, Inc. , its successors or assigns, or any merged or
successor corporation or entity, which may in the future operate or maintain

1222.01  TITLE; PURPOSE; JURISDICTION.
   (a)   Title. These regulations shall be known and may be cited as and called
the “Subdivision Regulations of the City of Northwood,” and may hereinafter be
referred to as “these Regulations.”
   (b)   Purpose. The general purpose of these Regulations shall be to guide
and regulate the planning, subdividing and development of land to promote and
protect the public health, safety and general welfare. It is intended that the
provisions of these Regulations shall be applied to achieve the following
objectives:
      (1)   Orderly development of land to obtain harmonious and stable
neighborhoods;
      (2)    Safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian circulation;
      (3)    Designs to allow ample public open spaces for schools,
recreational purposes and other public purposes;
      (4)   Accurate surveying of land and preparation and recording of plats;
      (5)   The assurance that subdivision improvements are properly installed
and completed according to the provisions of Section

      (6)   Coordination of land development according to the Zoning Code and
the Comprehensive Plan.
   (c)   Jurisdiction and Relationship to Other Laws. These Regulations shall
be applicable to all areas within the corporation limits of the City. The
provisions of these Regulations shall supplement any laws of the State, other
City ordinances and any other rules or regulations. Whenever the requirements
of these Regulations differ from the requirements of any other lawfully adopted
rules, regulations, ordinances or resolutions, the most restrictive, or those
imposing the highest standard, shall govern.
   (d)   Deed Restrictions. Private deed restrictions imposed by the developer
will not be enforced by the City.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02; Ord. 2018-53.  Passed 2-24-19.)
1222.02  AUTHORITY; ADMINISTRATION; AMENDMENTS.
   (a)   Authority. The Planning Commission derives its authority in the matter
of regulating the subdivision of land from Section
10.03 of the City Charter.
   (b)   Administration and Fees. These Regulations shall be administered by
the Planning Commission. Council shall establish a schedule of fees, charges
and expenses that shall apply to administration of these Regulations. No action
shall be taken on any subdivision application or appeal unless the required
fees have been paid in full.
   (c)   Amendments. Amendments to these Subdivision Regulations may be made in
accordance with the City Charter.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02; Ord. 2018-53.  Passed 2-24-19.)
1222.03  DEFINITIONS.
   (EDITOR'S NOTE: See Section
1240.06 of the Zoning Code for definitions relating to the Subdivision
Regulations.)
1222.04  PRINCIPLES OF ACCEPTABLE SUBDIVISION DESIGN.
   (a)   All subdivision development shall conform with the Comprehensive Plan,
as adopted.
   (b)   The proposed subdivision and its ultimate use shall be in the best
interests of the public welfare and the neighborhood development of the area.
Land to be subdivided shall be of such a character that it can be used safely
for building purposes without danger to health or peril from fire, flood or
other menace, and land shall not be subdivided until it is shown that adequate
public facilities and improvements will exist and that proper provision has
been made for drainage, water supply, sewage disposal, transportation
facilities and recreational facilities.
   (c)   The tract to be subdivided should not encroach upon an area designated
in the Comprehensive Plan for future public facilities. Such area shall be
incorporated in all plans or plats and such land may be required to be reserved
for one year after approval thereof, or for a longer period as may be mutually
agreed upon, to allow the City or other appropriate agencies time to acquire
such land.
   (d)   In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for all natural
features such as large trees, watercourses, historical locations and similar
community assets, which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and value to the
property and will preserve the resources of the community.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02; Ord. 2018-53.  Passed 2-24-19.)
1222.05  SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS.
   (a)   General Statement.
      (1)   The regulations in this section shall control the manner in which
streets, lots and other elements of a subdivision are arranged on the land.
These design controls shall help insure convenient and safe streets, the
creation of usable lots, the provision of space for public utilities and
reservation of land for recreational uses. The planning of attractive and
functional neighborhoods shall be promoted, minimizing the undesirable features
of unplanned, haphazard growth.
      (2)   All improvements must meet the minimum requirements of the State of
Ohio Department of Transportation Construction and Material Specifications, the
latest edition, and of the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency.
   (b)   Conformity to Comprehensive Plan and Zoning. The arrangement,
character, width and location of all arterial and collector thoroughfares, or
extensions thereof, shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan. Thoroughfares not
contained in the aforementioned Plan shall conform to the recommendation of the
Planning Commission, based upon the design standards set forth herein. No plat
shall be approved unless it conforms to the requirements of the Zoning Code.
   (c)   Suitability of Land. No land shall be subdivided which is held
unsuitable for its intended use by the Planning Commission for reasons of
flooding, inadequate drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations
for development, severe erosion potential, unfavorable topography, inadequate
water supply or sewage disposal capabilities or any other feature harmful to
the health, safety or welfare of the future residents of the proposed
subdivision or community. However, the Planning Commission may approve a final
plat if the subdivider improves the land consistent with the standards of these
Regulations and other applicable ordinances to make the area, in the opinion of
the Planning Commission, suitable for its intended use.
   (d)   Street Design.
      (1)   Relation to adjoining street system. The proposed street system
shall be an extension of existing streets at the same or greater width, but not
less than the required minimum width.
      (2)   Street widths. The minimum width of a right-of-way, measured from
the lot line to the opposite side lot line, shall be based upon functional
classification and as shown in Tables 1 and 2 hereof, or as shown on the
Comprehensive Plan.
      (3)   Additional width on existing streets. Subdivisions that adjoin
existing streets shall dedicate additional rights-of-way to meet the minimum
street width requirements, as described herein. The entire right-of- way shall
be provided where any part of the subdivision is on both sides of the existing
street. When the subdivision is located on only one side of an existing street,
at least one-half of the required right-of- way, measured from the center line
of the existing roadway, shall be provided. In no case shall the resulting
right-of-way width be less than sixty feet.
      (4)   Restriction of access. When a tract fronts on an arterial street or
highway, the Planning Commission may require such lots to be provided with
frontage on a marginal access street.
      (5)   Intersections. Street intersections shall be as nearly at right
angles as possible, and no intersection shall be at an angle less than as
specified in Table 1. Multiple intersections involving junctions of more than
two streets shall be avoided. Property line radii at street intersections shall
not be less than twenty feet and, where the angle of the street intersection is
less than seventy-five degrees, the Planning Commission may require a greater
right-of-way radius. Wherever necessary to allow the construction of a curb
having a desirable radius without curtailing the sidewalk at a street corner to
less than normal width, the property line at such street corners shall be
rounded or otherwise set back sufficiently to permit such construction.

commercial or industrial purposes and shall not be provided in residential
subdivisions, except where the subdivider produces evidence, satisfactory to
the Planning Commission, of the need for alleys.
      (9)   Street layout. The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade
construction and location of all streets shall conform to the Comprehensive
Plan and to the construction standards of the municipality, or subsequent
amendments thereto, and shall be considered in their relation to existing and
planned streets, topographical conditions and public convenience and safety,
and in their appropriate relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served
by such streets. The street pattern shall discourage through traffic in the
interior of a subdivision. The subdivider shall provide, within the boundaries
of the subdivision plat, the necessary right-of- way for the widening,
continuance or alignment of such streets in conformity with the Comprehensive
Plan. The finished elevation of proposed streets shall be no more than one foot
below the l00-year flood elevation. The Planning Commission may require, where
necessary, profiles and elevations of streets to determine compliance with this
requirement. Drainage openings shall be sufficient to discharge flood flows
without unduly increasing flood heights.
      (10)   Street design standards for local streets. The design and
improvement standards contained in the following table are minimum standards
for local streets in residential subdivisions. All such streets shall be

feet for the right-of-way and eighteen feet for the pavement width.
      (15)   Streets for commercial subdivision. Streets serving business
developments and accessory parking areas shall be planned to connect with
arterial streets so as not to generate traffic on local streets. The
intersections of driveways from parking areas with arterial or collector
streets shall be located so as to cause the least possible interference with
traffic movement on those streets. The Planning Commission may require marginal
access streets to provide maximum safety and convenience.
      (16)   Streets for industrial subdivisions. Collector streets for
industrial subdivisions shall be planned to serve industrial areas exclusively
and shall connect with arterial streets so that no industrial traffic will be
directed into any residential streets. Streets shall be planned to be extended
to the boundaries of any adjoining land planned for industry, except for severe
physical conditions or if the Commission finds such extension is not in accord
with the approved plan of the area. The Planning Commission reserves the right
to increase any street design standard provided herein so as to adapt to an
anticipated high level of heavy traffic in an industrial development.
      (17)   Sidewalks and pedestrian access. Sidewalks shall be required on
both sides of the street in all residential subdivisions. Public sidewalks
shall also be required in all commercial subdivisions and along all commercial
lots. The Planning Commission may waive this requirement, on one or both sides
of the street, if the requirement for curbs and gutters is waived, and if the
Planning Commission also finds that the proposed residential density is such
that sidewalks are not desirable. Regardless of whether sidewalks are required,
the Planning Commission may also require perpetual unobstructed easements, up
to twenty feet in width, to facilitate pedestrian access between a development
and nearby schools, parks, playgrounds or other community facilities. Such
pedestrian easements shall be shown on the plat, and a vegetated screening
shall be provided as a buffer between the pedestrian easement and all adjacent
lots.
   At the option of the Planning Commission, the installation of sidewalks in a
subdivision may be delayed until seventy-five percent of all building sites are
built upon, or within two years from final plat approval, whichever comes
first. Under such circumstances, the developer shall provide a bond, a letter
of credit or cash escrow, which is independent from any guarantees provided in
Section
1222.07, to guarantee the installation of the sidewalks. The amount of the
guarantee shall be approved by the City Engineer and shall reflect the
estimated cost of the improvements at the end of the two-year period. The
guarantee shall be approved as to form by the City Attorney and formally
accepted by Council.
   When an owner of a lot or parcel in a subdivision owns a lot or parcel
adjacent to a lot or parcel where a house is being constructed shall be
required to install the sidewalk on that adjacent lot or parcel when the
sidewalk is installed on the lot or parcel where the house is located.
      (18)   Blocks. The following regulations shall govern the design and
layout of blocks:
         A.    The arrangement of blocks shall conform to the street planning
criteria set forth in this section, and shall be arranged to accommodate lots
and building sites of a size and character required for the district, as set
forth in the Zoning Code.
         B.    Irregularly shaped blocks, those intended for cul-de-sacs or
loop streets and those containing interior parks or playgrounds may be approved
by the Commission if properly designed and located and if the maintenance of
interior public spaces is covered by agreements.
         C.    No block shall be longer than 1,200 feet or shorter than 400
feet and the block width shall accommodate two tiers of lots, except where
unusual topography or other exceptional physical circumstances exist.
      (19)   Street surfaces. The surface course of the street shall be
constructed of either asphaltic concrete, bituminous mix or Portland cement
concrete. At a minimum, three and one-half inches of asphaltic concrete on
eight inches of 304 base is required, or if concrete streets are proposed, a
minimum of six inches of pavement thickness is required. Alternative materials
and thicknesses may be approved or required as determined by the City Engineer.
      (20)   Additional pavement lanes. Additional pavement lanes and/or
signalization may be required for commercial or other special developments or
conditions to provide acceleration, deceleration or left turn lanes, or to
handle or control excessive traffic that may be generated by a particular
development.
      (21)   Curbs and gutters. Curbs and gutters are required in all
subdivisions. The Planning Commission may waive this requirement if it finds
that the proposed residential density, specific development type or hydrologic
conditions are such that improvements are not necessary.
      (22)   Street lighting. All streets within a subdivision shall be
improved by installing street lights at the sole cost of the developer, with
ornamental poles and underground wiring following approved modern intensities,
as recommended by the electric company.
      (23)   Street trees. Street trees shall be provided in the right-of-way
by the subdivider. At least one street tree shall be provided on each
residential lot in residential subdivisions. The trees shall be located in such
a manner as to not block visibility along any street or affect any underground
utilities or street lights. Tree species shall be approved by the Public
Service Director following the Tree Commission's rules and regulations.
   (e)   Lots. The following regulations shall govern the design and layout of
lots:
      (1)    The lot arrangement and design shall be such that all lots will
provide satisfactory building sites which are properly related to the
topography and the character of the surrounding development.
      (2)    All lots shall conform to or shall exceed the requirements of
these Subdivision Regulations and the zoning district requirements for the
district in which they are located and the use for which they are intended.
      (3)    Each lot shall front on a public thoroughfare. The minimum lot
sizes, widths and setbacks shall be as specified in the Zoning Code.
      (4)    All side lot lines shall be at right angles to street lines and
radial to curved street lines, except where the Commission decides that a
variation to this rule would provide a better layout.
      (5)   Lots with double frontage shall be avoided, except where the
Commission decides that it is essential to provide separation of residential
development from arterial streets.
      (6)    No corner lot shall have a width at the building line in each
direction of less than that which is consistent with the Zoning Code.
   (f)   Site Grading. All lots shall be graded to carry surface water away
from all proposed building sites and to an approved watercourse or storm sewer
. Preliminary lot grading shall be completed at the time of street and utility
installation to prevent water from ponding on undeveloped lots. The finished
grade at the building foundation for all structures shall be a minimum of one
foot above grade at the sidewalk or front lot line and shall be shown on the
site grading plan for each lot. Retaining walls shall be constructed on side or
rear lot lines where the grade varies across lot lines by one foot or more,
within three feet of a side lot line. All structures are to be constructed at
elevations that conform to the floodplain regulations.
   A grading and drainage plan shall be submitted, showing all existing and
proposed storm sewers, manholes, catch basins, watercourses, culverts and other
underground structures within the tract and immediately adjacent thereto, with
pipe sizes and grades or waterway openings shown. Topographic contours to one
foot shall be shown thereon. The plan shall show the method to be used for
adequate disposal of all storm sewer water, including drainage outlets, and
shall include a typical lot cross-section drawn perpendicular to the street
indicating lot grading and such other data as may be required by the City
Engineer. Such plans shall be drawn at a scale of not less than 50 feet to the
inch.
   (g)   Easements. Easements at least ten feet in width centered along rear or
side lot lines shall be provided, where necessary, for sanitary sewers, gas
mains, water lines and electric lines. Easements thirty feet in width from the
top of the bank on each side of every watercourse, drainage channel or stream
shall be provided within a subdivision. This is the minimum easement; larger
easements may be required for multiple utilities. Public utility companies
shall be consulted for input on easement locations and widths, so as to
minimize future difficulties in servicing.
   (h)   Storm Drainage. Storm sewer improvements are required, except where
the Planning Commission decides that swales or drainage ditches are acceptable,
due to specific circumstances, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer.
Additionally, the following requirements apply:
      (1)   Access to storm drainage ditches and channels shall be by means of
easements. Such easements shall be of a width determined by the City Engineer.
      (2)   Storm drainage easements containing underground facilities shall
have a minimum width of twenty feet. The Planning Commission may require wider
easements, upon the recommendation of the City Engineer, based on the size of
the storm sewer.
      (3)   Whenever a storm drainage ditch or channel has a depth of five feet
or more and a bank slope of two feet horizontal to one foot vertical or
steeper, a five-foot-high masonry wall or a five-foot-high chain link fence may
be required by the Commission.
      (4)   In accordance with EPA regulations, a stormwater permit may be
required for the discharge of stormwater. Evidence of compliance with this
requirement shall be provided.
      (5)   Drainage laterals, which include an adequate outlet, shall be
designed and constructed to provide for disposal of all surface water. Such
design shall accommodate a five-year frequency storm with the sewer pipe
flowing full and a ten-year frequency hydraulic grade line below the pavement
low-point. The drainage system shall, in addition, provide a drainage outlet
which shall be a minimum of three feet below the mean ground level for each
lot. Drainage ditches shall be enclosed to accommodate the estimated ten-year
storm when the enclosure is equivalent in capacity to forty-eight inches in
diameter or less. Such enclosures shall be constructed, installed and paid for
by the subdivider. All ditches shall be enclosed within the new street right-
of-way. Such enclosures shall be adequate to handle the storm drainage and
shall be constructed, installed and paid for by the subdivider. Copies of
calculations illustrating estimated volumes and peak flows of runoff shall be
provided for review by the City Engineer.
      (6)   Detention of stormwater runoff on-site may be required, if, in the
opinion of the City Engineer, such detention is required to prevent downstream
flooding.
      (7)   Where floodplains are being reduced or eliminated by the site
grading of the proposed subdivision, approval shall be obtained from the
applicable agency as to the adequacy of the watercourse to handle the
additional water due to the altered land use collections. The l00-year
floodplain elevation shall be shown on the preliminary plan as well as on the
final plat. The lowest finished floor elevations shall be a minimum of one foot
above the regulatory l00-year floodplain.
      (8)   A storm water management plan shall be required meeting the City
and EPA requirements.
   (i)   Community Assets. In all subdivisions, due regard shall be shown for
all natural features such as large trees, watercourses, historical spots and
similar community assets, which, if preserved, will add attractiveness and
value to the property.
   (j)   Large Tracts or Parcels. When land is subdivided into parcels larger
than ordinary building lots, such parcels shall be arranged to allow for the
opening of future streets and logical further resubdivision.
   (k)    Utilities. All utilities shall be placed underground.
   (l)   Water Supply. When an adequate public waterline is within 1,000 feet
of a subdivision, such line shall be extended so that each lot is accessible to
the public water supply. When an adequate public waterline is not available, a
well may be the source of water for each lot, if such a well and the water
quality thereof meet the requirements of the Health Department having
jurisdiction.
   (m)   Sewage Disposal. When a proposed subdivision is located within 300
feet of an adequate sanitary sewer line, a connection to the line shall be
provided for each lot by the developer. On-site sewage disposal may be approved
if such disposal meets the requirements of the Health Department having
jurisdiction.
   (n)   Fees for Parks and Recreation. Pursuant to Section
886.01 of these Codified Ordinances, fees are required of new residential
developments for parks and recreation facilities.
   (o)   Dedication of Park Lands or Payments of Fees in Lieu Thereof. As a
condition of approval of a final plat of a subdivision, or of a final plat of a
planned development, the City shall require that land for park and recreational
purposes, or cash contributions in lieu of land, or a combination of both, at
the option of the City, be provided to serve said needs specifically and
uniquely attributable to the residents of such subdivision or planned
development. This land or cash or a combination thereof shall be provided in
accordance with the following criteria and formula:
      (1)   Criteria for park and recreational land requirements.
         A.   Land requirements and population ratio. The amount of land
required for dedication for park and recreational purposes shall be a direct
function of the ultimate population density of a proposed development. The
total requirement shall be seven acres of land per 1,000 of ultimate
population. Ultimate population shall be computed on the basis of four persons
per unit, unless it can be shown that a lesser number of persons can reasonably
be expected as a result of the type of development proposed.
         B.    Location. The location and configuration of the site within the
development to be dedicated shall be determined by the Planning Commission,
based upon recommendations contained in the Comprehensive Plan and in
consultation with any applicable municipal park and recreation committees. The
Planning Commission shall also consider the suitability of the site for park
purposes or development, its relationship to population concentrations and its
proximity to other park or recreational lands.
         C.    Minimum size. The minimum size of any land to be dedicated for
park and recreational purposes shall be no less than 10,000 square feet, one
dimension of which cannot be less than 100 feet, except that the Planning
Commission may recommend that Council accept the dedication of a smaller size,
when required by the specific plans of the development, and when the usefulness
of the smaller area for park and recreational purposes is demonstrated.
         D.    Use of detention areas for required dedications. Detention areas
for stormwater control shall not qualify as land for park and recreational
purposes, unless the use of the property for such purposes is clearly
demonstrated.
         E.    Private open spaces and recreational areas. No more than forty
percent of the land required for park and recreational purposes shall be
privately owned and maintained. The City shall approve the detailed plans for
all improvements for such park and recreational land which is privately owned
and maintained, and guarantees of the permanency of the use and maintenance of
such privately-owned and maintained park and recreational open space,
satisfactory to and enforceable by the City, shall be entered into by the
subdivider or developer, which guarantees may include covenants and/or express
provisions in the articles of condominium ownership, or in the constitution and
by-laws of a homeowners' association.
      (2)   Criteria for requiring a contribution in lieu of park sites. Where
the development is small and the resulting land dedication is too small to be
practical, or when the available land is inappropriate for park and
recreational purposes, as determined by the Planning Commission, the subdivider
or developer shall pay a cash contribution in lieu of the land required.
         A.   Cash contribution in lieu of park and recreational land
dedications. The cash contributions in lieu of park and recreational land
dedications shall be held in trust by the City, or other public body designated
by the City, solely for the acquisition of park and recreational land, which
will be available to serve the immediate or future needs of the residents of
that subdivision or development or for the improvement of any existing local
park and recreational land that already services such needs.
         B.    Refund of cash contribution. If any portion of a cash
contribution in lieu of park and recreational land dedication is not expended
for the purposes set forth herein within seven years from the date of receipt
of such contribution by the City, such contribution shall be refunded to the
subdivider or developer who made such contribution, along with any accrued
interest earned on such funds.
         C.   Basis for determining cash contribution. The cash contribution in
lieu of land dedication shall be based on the fair market value of the acres of
undeveloped land in the area to be improved, as specified herein, that
otherwise would have been dedicated as park and recreational sites. Evidence of
the value of the land shall be provided by a third party and deemed acceptable
by the Planning Commission.
         D.    Criteria for requiring dedication and a contribution. A
combination of land dedication and a contribution in lieu of land shall be
required, when:
            1.   The subdivision or development does not have sufficient or
adequate land to meet the dedication requirements of this section. That portion
of the land within the subdivision or development which is adequate or
sufficient for the park shall be dedicated as a site as aforesaid, and a cash
contribution in lieu thereof shall be required for any additional land that
would have been required to be dedicated.
            2.   A major part of the local park or recreational site has
already been acquired and only a small portion of land is needed from the
development to complete the site. The remaining portions shall be required by
dedication, and a cash contribution in lieu thereof shall also be required.
         E.   Criteria for a fully developed park. A fully developed park,
including appropriate lighting, grading, landscaping and recreational
equipment, may be required when the availability of land for park land is
limited and where the recreational needs of the residents of the subdivision
can be satisfied with a smaller but fully-developed park with a more intensive
activity level.
      (3)   Combining with adjoining developments. Park or recreational land
dedications may be combined with dedications from adjoining subdivisions and
developments in order to produce a usable recreational area without hardship to
a particular developer.
      (4)   Topography and grading. The slope, topography and geology of the
dedicated site, as well as its surroundings, must be suitable for its intended
purposes. Grading on sites for park and recreational uses shall not differ
greatly from the grading of surrounding land.

Passed 2-24-19.)
1222.06  PROCEDURE FOR SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
   (a)   Major Subdivisions and Minor Subdivisions. There are two types of
subdivisions, major subdivisions, which require the submission and approval of
a plat, and minor subdivisions, which have an abbreviated approval process.
Minor subdivisions, or subdivisions that occur without a plat, involve the
division of parcels along existing public roads with no more than five lots,
after the original tract has been completely subdivided. Section
1222.08 defines the process for approval of a minor subdivision or approval
without a plat. Major subdivisions involve more than five lots and/or the
construction of new streets, new public improvements, condominium developments
or other developments involving easements of access. Subsections (b) through
(v) hereof, define the process for approval of a major subdivision plat.
   (b)   Preapplication Meeting. The subdivider is encouraged to meet with the
City Engineer or his or her designated representative before submitting any
subdivision plan or plat. The purpose of this meeting is to discuss, early and
informally, the purpose and effect of these Regulations and the criteria and
standards contained herein, and to familiarize the developer with the
Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning Code and the drainage, sewerage and water
systems for the City.
   (c)   Sketch Plan Content. The subdivider may submit to the Planning
Commission a sketch plan legibly drawn at a suitable scale and containing the
following information:
      (1)   The proposed subdivision in relation to existing community
facilities, thoroughfares and other transportation modes, shopping centers,
manufacturing establishments, residential developments and existing natural and
man-made features, such as soil types, vegetation, contours and utilities in
the neighboring area.
      (2)   The layout and acreage of streets, lots and any nonresidential
sites, such as commercial, manufacturing, school or recreational uses within
the proposed subdivision.
      (3)   The location of utilities in the proposed subdivision, if
available, or the locations of the nearest sources for water and public
facilities for the disposal of sewage and stormwater.
      (4)   The scale and title of the subdivision, a north arrow and the date.
      (5)   The names, addresses and telephone numbers of owners and
developers.
   The purpose of this sketch plan is not for approval or disapproval, but
rather to provide the developer with an opportunity to discuss a proposed
development with the Planning Commission at a more conceptual stage. Review of
a sketch plan can provide guidance to the developer in terms of desired
subdivision design and general requirements before more detailed engineering is
performed.
   (d)   Preliminary Drawing. After the preapplication stage, the subdivider
shall submit a preliminary drawing of the proposed subdivision, which shall
conform to the requirements set forth in this chapter. The preliminary drawing
shall be prepared by a qualified registered engineer or surveyor.
   (e)   Submission to State Highway Director. Before any plat is approved that
affects any land within 300 feet of the centerline of a proposed new highway or
a highway for which changes are proposed, as described in the certification to
local officials by the State Department of Transportation (ODOT) of any land
within a radius of 500 feet from the point of intersection of said centerline
with any public road or highway, the Commission shall give notice, by
registered or certified mail, to ODOT. The Commission shall not approve such
plat for 120 days from the date the notice is received by ODOT. If the Highway
Director notifies the Commission that it shall proceed to acquire the land
needed, the Commission shall refuse to approve the plat. If ODOT notifies the
Commission that acquisition at this time is not in the public interest, or upon
the expiration of the 120-day period or any extension thereof agreed upon by
ODOT and the property owner, the Commission shall, if the plat is in
conformance with all provisions of these Regulations, approve the plat.
   (f)   Application for Tentative Approval. An application, in writing, for
the tentative approval of the preliminary drawing, together with fifteen copies
of the preliminary drawing and the supplementary information specified in
subsection (i) hereof, shall be submitted to the Planning Commission.

adjoining parcels of unsubdivided land and the location of the boundary lines
of such adjacent lands.
      (8)   The locations, widths and names of existing streets, railroad
rights-of- way, easements, parks, permanent buildings and corporation and
township lines; and the location of wooded areas and other significant
topographic and natural features within and adjacent to the plat, for a minimum
distance of 200 feet.
      (9)   The zoning classification of the tract and adjoining properties and
a description of proposed zoning changes, if any.
      (10)   The existing contours, at an interval of not greater than two
feet.
      (11)   The existing sewers, water lines, culverts and other underground
structures and power transmission poles and lines both within and adjacent to
the tract.
      (12)   The 100-year flood elevations and boundaries, including the

   (j)   Filing. The preliminary drawing shall be considered officially filed
when all required information is submitted to the authorized representative of
the Planning Commission, along with the applicable filing fee.
   (k)   Public Meeting and Consideration of Preliminary Drawing. Upon receipt
of a formal and complete application for preliminary drawing approval, the
Planning Commission shall consider such preliminary drawing at a public meeting
to be held not less than twenty nor more than fifty days following such
submission. A notice of such public meeting shall be sent by regular mail to
all adjoining property owners at least fifteen calendar days before such
meeting.
   (l)   Approval of Preliminary Drawing. The Planning Commission shall forward
copies of the preliminary drawing to such officials and agencies as are deemed
necessary, for study and recommendation. After the receipt of reports, if any,
from such officials and agencies, the Planning Commission shall decide whether
the preliminary drawing shall be approved, approved with modifications or
disapproved. If a drawing is disapproved, the reasons for such disapproval
shall be stated in writing. The Planning Commission shall act on the
preliminary drawing within fifty days after filing, unless such time is
extended by agreement with the subdivider. When a preliminary drawing has been
approved by the Planning Commission, the Chairperson shall sign all copies and
return one to the subdivider for compliance with final approval requirements.
Approval of the preliminary drawing shall be conditional upon compliance with
all other applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations of the Municipality,
but shall not constitute acceptance of the final plat.
   (m)   Approval Period. The approval of the preliminary drawing shall be
effective for a maximum period of twelve months and shall guarantee that the
terms under which the approval was granted will not be affected by changes to
these Regulations, unless such changes are mandated by Federal or State law.
   (n)   Final Plat Required. The subdivider must submit a final plat,
including detailed construction plans and specifications of the improvements
required therein. The final plat shall have incorporated all changes in any
plan previously reviewed by the Planning Commission. The final plat and the
supplementary information shall be prepared by a qualified, registered engineer
or surveyor.
   (o)   Application for Approval of the Final Plat. An application for
approval of the final plat shall be submitted on forms provided by the Planning
Commission, together with five copies of the plat and the supplementary
information specified.
   (p)   Regulations Governing Improvements. The final detailed plans and
specifications of improvements shall be prepared and submitted two weeks before
a regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission by a registered
professional engineer. The plans shall be drawn on tracing cloth or other
material of equal permanence and shall be on one or more sheets twenty-four by
thirty-six inches in size. The plans shall include typical sections, plans and
profile views, cross sections, a site grading plan, construction details and
estimates of quantities. All final detailed plans and specifications of the
improvements shall meet the approval of the City Engineer and applicable State
and County agencies, before commencement of the installation of the required
improvements. Before the granting of approval of the final plat, the subdivider
shall have installed the required improvements or shall have furnished a surety
or certified check for the estimated construction cost of the ultimate
installation and the initial maintenance of the improvements. Before the surety
is accepted, it shall be approved by the City Attorney.
   (q)   Final Plat Form. The final plat shall be prepared by a registered
professional surveyor and shall be legibly drawn in waterproof ink on tracing
cloth or other material of equal permanence. It shall be drawn at a scale not
less than 100 feet to the inch and shall be on one or more sheets twenty by
thirty inches in size.
   When possible, a scale of one inch equals fifty feet should be used. When
more than one sheet is required, an index sheet of the same size shall be filed
showing the entire subdivision, with the sheets lettered in alphabetical order
as a key.
   (r)   Final Plat Contents. The final plat shall contain the following
information:

            2.   The subdivision plat sign can be installed at any public road
or street entrance to the subdivision at the following locations:
               a.   The subdivision plat sign can be located within a proposed
public right-of-way boulevard island of the public road or street entrance of
the subdivision. The sign shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the
existing right-of- way of the existing intersecting road or street. The sign
location shall be located in a manner so as to not a create traffic hazard from
the standpoint of adequate sight distance.
               b.   The subdivision plat sign can be located within a sign
easement area a minimum of ten feet behind the right-of-way of both the
proposed public road or street entrance of the subdivision and the existing
intersecting road or street. The sign location shall be located in a manner so
as to not create traffic hazard from the standpoint of adequate sight distance.
               c.   The Planning Commission shall have final approval of the
location of the subdivision plat sign.
            3.   The subdivision plat sign shall be constructed of at least 40%
stone or brick.  The Planning Commission shall have final approval of the

   (s)   Supplementary Information. The following information shall be supplied
in addition to the above requirements:
      (1)   If a zoning change is involved, certification from the Zoning
Inspector, indicating that the change has been approved and is in effect;
      (2)   Certification showing that the final detailed plans and
specifications for the improvements have been approved by the City Engineer and
other proper State and County agencies;
      (3)   Certification showing that all required improvements have been
either installed and approved by the proper officials or agencies, or that a
bond or other surety has been furnished assuring installation and initial
maintenance of the required improvements;
      (4)   The names and addresses of all property owners who adjoin the
proposed subdivision, including those across the street from the site.
   (t)   Filing. The final plat shall be considered officially filed when all
required information is submitted to the authorized representative of the
Planning Commission, along with the applicable filing fee.
   (u)   Approval of Final Plat. The Planning Commission shall approve or
disapprove the final plat within thirty days after it has been filed. The plat
will not be considered to be filed until it is found to be complete by the
Commission at a public meeting. Failure of the Commission to act upon the final
plat within such time shall be deemed approval of the plat. If the plat is
disapproved, the grounds for disapproval shall be stated in the records of the
Commission and a copy of said record shall be forwarded to the subdivider. The
Commission shall not disapprove the final plat if the developer has complied
with all applicable regulations and has proceeded in accordance with the
conditions and standards specified in the approved preliminary drawing. If
disapproved, the subdivider shall make the necessary corrections and resubmit
the final plat within sixty days to the Commission for its final approval. If a
plat is refused by the Commission, the person submitting the plat shall be
entitled to such appeal as is provided in the Ohio Revised Code.
   (v)   Signing and Recording of Final Plat. When a subdivision improvement
agreement and security are involved, the Chairperson of the Planning Commission
and the Secretary shall endorse the approval on the final plat only after the
subdivision improvement agreement has been approved by Council and the security
has been approved by the City Attorney. When the installation of improvements
is required prior to the recording of the final plat, the Chairperson of the
Planning Commission and the Secretary shall endorse approval on the plat only
after all improvements have been satisfactorily completed. Written evidence
shall be provided from the City Engineer that all improvements have been
installed in a manner satisfactory to the City. The City Attorney shall review
the proper dedication of the improvements and the land.
   (w)   Resubdivision of Land. Whenever a developer or property owner desires
to resubdivide an already approved final subdivision plat, the developer or
property owner shall first obtain approval by the same procedures and according
to the same requirements described for new subdivisions. Resubdivision includes
any change in street layout or other public improvement, any change in lot
lines, changes in any land used for public purposes or any change in easements.
Whenever the Planning Commission, in its sole discretion, finds that, due to
the minor nature of the proposed change to the existing subdivision, waivers of
specific procedural requirements contained herein would not be contrary to the
purpose and intent of this chapter, then such requirements may be waived.
   (x)   Lot Combinations. Any existing lot may be combined with an adjoining
existing lot to form a single new lot, provided that no lot combination results
in an adjoining lot or lots being reduced in size or dimension so as to
conflict with the applicable zoning regulations, such as minimum lot size or
minimum front, side or rear yard requirements and must be recorded in Wood
County records.

1222.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTION OF IMPROVEMENTS.
   (a)   Guarantee for Installation of Improvements and Subdivision Improvement
Agreements.
      (1)   Completion of improvements. Before the final subdivision plat is
signed by the Chairperson of the Planning Commission, all developers shall be
required to complete, in accordance with decisions of the Planning Commission,
and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer, all street, sanitary and other
public improvements, including lot improvements on the individual lots, as
required in these Regulations, as specified in the final subdivision plat and
as approved by the Planning Commission, and to dedicate those public
improvements to the City, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances on the
dedicated property and public improvements. At the time that the plans are
approved, the developer shall be required to submit a construction time
schedule, an estimate of construction costs and a material specification list
itemizing the material type, the supplier and the manufacturer. The applicant
shall covenant to maintain each required public improvement, until acceptance
by Council of the dedication of that completed public improvement, and shall
warrant that all required public improvements will be free from defect for a
period of two years following acceptance by Council of the dedication of the
last completed public improvement. The warrant shall consist of a maintenance
bond, or the equivalent, equal to fifty percent of the construction cost.
      (2)   Subdivision improvement agreements and guarantees.
         A.   Agreement. The Planning Commission, at its sole discretion, may
waive the requirement that the applicant shall complete and dedicate all public
improvements before approval of the final subdivision plat and, as an
alternative, allow the applicant to enter into a subdivision improvement
agreement by which the subdivider covenants to complete all required public
improvements no later than one year following the date on which the Chairperson
of the Planning Commission signs the final subdivision plat. The applicant
shall covenant to maintain each required public improvement until acceptance by
Council of the dedication of that completed public improvement and shall
warrant that all required public improvements will be free from defect for a
period of two years following acceptance by Council of the dedication of the
last completed public improvement. The subdivision improvement agreement shall
contain other terms and conditions agreed to by the applicant and the Planning
Commission. The warrant shall consist of a maintenance bond, or the equivalent,
equal to fifty percent of the construction cost.
         B.   Covenants to run. The subdivision improvement agreement shall
provide that the covenants contained in the agreement shall run with the land
and bind all successors, heirs and assignees of the subdivider. The subdivision
improvement agreement will be approved by the Planning Commission and Council,
and shall be recorded in the Wood County Recorder's Office.
      (3)   Security. Whenever the Planning Commission permits an applicant to
enter into a subdivision improvement agreement, the Commission shall require
the applicant to provide a letter of credit, cash escrow or a bond as security
for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement. Any
security shall be in an amount equal to 100 percent of the estimated cost of
completion of the required public improvements, including lot improvements. The
issuer of the letter of credit or the escrow agent, as applicable, shall be
acceptable to the Planning Commission.
         A.   Letter of credit. If the applicant posts a letter of credit as
security for the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement,
the credit shall be irrevocable; shall be for a term sufficient to cover the
completion, maintenance and warranty periods; and shall require only that the
City present an affidavit signed by the City Attorney attesting to the City's
right to draw funds under the credit.
         B.   Cash escrow. If the applicant posts a cash escrow as security for
the promises contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, the escrow
instructions shall provide that the subdivider will have no right to a return
of any of the funds, except as provided herein, and that the escrow agent shall
have a legal duty to deliver the funds to the City whenever the City Attorney
presents an affidavit to the agent attesting to the Municipality's right to
receive such funds whether or not the subdivider protests that right.
         C.   Waiver. If the City accepts the offer of dedication for the last
completed required public improvement, the City shall execute a waiver of its
right to receive all but ten percent of the funds represented by the letter of
credit or cash escrow, if the subdivider is not in breach of the subdivision
improvement agreement. The residual funds shall be security for the
subdivider's covenant to maintain the required public improvements and the
subdivider's warranty that the improvements are free from defect.
         D.   Bond. The applicant may post a bond as security for promises
contained in the subdivision improvement agreement, subject to the approval of
the City Attorney.
      (4)   Temporary improvements. The applicant shall build and pay for all
costs of temporary improvements required by the Planning Commission and shall
maintain those temporary improvements for the period specified by the
Commission.
      (5)   Costs of improvements. All required improvements shall be made by
the developer, at his or her expense, without reimbursement by the local
government.
      (6)   Failure to complete improvements. For subdivisions for which no
subdivision improvement agreement has been executed and no security has been
posted, if the improvements are not completed within the period specified by
the Planning Commission in the resolution approving the preliminary drawing,
approval shall be deemed to have expired. In those cases where a subdivision
improvement agreement has been executed and security has been posted and the
required public improvements have not been installed according to the terms of
the agreement, the City may then declare the agreement to be in default and may
require that all the improvements be installed regardless of the extent of the
building development at the time the agreement is declared to be in default.
The City then may:
         A.   Suspend final subdivision plat approval until the improvements
are completed and record a document to that effect for the purpose of public
notice;
         B.   Obtain funds under the security and complete improvements itself
or through a third party;
         C.   Assign its right to receive funds under the security to any third
party, including a subsequent owner of the subdivision for which improvements
were not constructed, in whole or in part, in exchange for that subsequent
owner's promise to complete improvements in the subdivision; or
         D.   Exercise any other rights available under the law.
      (7)   Acceptance of dedication offers. Acceptance of formal offers of
dedication of streets, public areas, easements and parks shall be by ordinance
of Council. The approval of a subdivision plat by the Planning Commission,
whether sketch, preliminary or final, shall not be deemed to constitute or
imply the acceptance by the City of any street, easement or park shown on the
plat. The Planning Commission may require the plat to be endorsed with
appropriate notes to this effect.
   (b)   Inspection of Improvements.
      (1)   General procedure and fees. The City Engineer shall provide for the
inspection of required improvements during construction and shall ensure their
satisfactory completion. The developer shall pay to the City an inspection fee
based on the estimated cost of an inspection and engineering review, and where
the improvements are completed before final plat approval, the subdivision plat
shall not be signed by the Chairperson of the Planning Commission unless the
inspection fee has been paid at the time of application. These fees shall be
due and payable upon demand of the City and no building permits or certificates
of occupancy shall be issued until all fees are paid. If the City Engineer
finds, upon inspection, that anyone or more of the required improvements have
not been constructed according to the City's construction standards and
specifications, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing the
improvements. The developer shall notify the City Engineer at least forty-eight
hours prior to the date on which construction is to commence so that an
inspection may be appropriately scheduled.
      (2)   Release or reduction of security.
         A.   Certificate of satisfactory completion. Council will not accept
the dedication of required improvements, nor release nor reduce the amount of
any security posted by the subdivider, until the City Engineer has submitted a
statement showing that all required improvements have been satisfactorily
completed and until:
            1.   The developer has certified to the City Engineer, through
submission of detailed “as-built” drawings of the subdivision, indicating
location, dimensions, materials and other information required by the Planning
Commission or the City Engineer, that the layout of the lines and grades of all
public improvements is in accordance with construction plans for the
subdivision; and
            2.   Evidence, satisfactory to the City Attorney, is furnished
showing that the improvements have been completed, are ready for dedication to
the City and are free and clear of any liens and encumbrances.
   Upon such approval and recommendation by the Planning Commission, the City
Engineer and the City Attorney, Council shall thereafter accept the
improvements for dedication according to established procedure and State Law.
         B.   Reduction of escrow funds and security. If the security posted by
the subdivider is a cash escrow, the amount of that escrow shall be reduced
upon actual acceptance of the dedication of public improvements and then only
by the ratio that the cost of the public improvement for which the dedication
was accepted bears to the total cost of public improvements for the
subdivision. Funds held in the escrow account shall not be released to the
subdivider, in whole or in part, except upon express written instruction of the
City Attorney. At the end of the warranty period, all escrow funds shall be
released to the subdivider. If the security provided by the subdivider is a
letter of credit, the City Attorney shall execute waivers of the City's right
to draw funds under the credit upon actual acceptance of the dedication of
public improvements and then only by the ratio that the cost of the public
improvement for which dedication was accepted bears to the total cost of public
improvements for the subdivision.
   (c)   Maintenance of improvements. The developer shall be required to
maintain all required public improvements on the individual subdivided lots and
to provide for snow removal on streets and sidewalks, if required by the
Planning Commission, until acceptance of the improvements by the governing
body.

occupants of surrounding parcels or the public. If the subdivision is approved,
"Approved by the Planning Commission of the City of Northwood, no plat
required" shall be stamped on a conveyance of the parcel or parcels involved.

approval to the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission may also include

1222.10  SALE OF LAND WITHIN SUBDIVISIONS.
   No owner or agent of the owner of any land located within a subdivision
shall transfer or sell any land by reference to, exhibition of or use of a plat
of the subdivision, before such plat has been approved and recorded in the

   The following regulations shall govern the granting of variances:
   (a)   Where the Planning Commission finds that extraordinary and unnecessary
hardship may result from strict compliance with these regulations, due to
exceptional topographic or other physical conditions, the Commission may vary
the regulations to relieve such hardship, provided such relief may be granted
without detriment to the public interest and without impairing the intent and
purpose of these regulations, or the desirable development of the neighborhood
and community, and provided there is no increase in the flood hazard or flood
damage potential. Such variations shall not have the effect of nullifying the
intent and purpose of these regulations, the Comprehensive Plan or the Zoning
Code.
   (b)   In granting variances or modifications, the Planning Commission may
require such conditions as will, in its judgment, secure substantially the
objective of the standards or requirements so varied or modified.

1222.99  PENALTY.
   The following penalties shall apply to violations of these Regulations:
   (a)   Whoever violates any rule or regulation adopted by Council for the
purpose of setting standards and requiring and securing the construction of
improvements within a subdivision, or fails to comply with any order pursuant
thereto, is creating a public nuisance. The creation of such nuisance may be
enjoined and the maintenance thereof may be abated by action at suit of the
Municipality or any citizen thereof. Whoever violates these Regulations shall
be fined not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than one
thousand dollars ($1,000.00). Such sum may be recovered, with costs, in a civil
action brought in the Court of Common Pleas.
   (b)   A Wood County Recorder who records a plat contrary to the provisions

been recorded in the office of the Wood County Recorder, shall forfeit and pay
the sum of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00), nor more than five
hundred dollars ($500.00), for each lot, parcel or tract of land so
transferred. The description of such lot, parcel or tract of land so
transferred by metes and bounds in the deed or transfer shall not serve to
exempt the seller from the forfeiture provided in this section. If such land is
within a municipal corporation, such sum may be recovered in a civil action
brought in the Court of Common Pleas by the legal representative of the
Municipality, in the name of the Municipality.
   (d)   Any person who disposes of or offers for sale or lease, for a time
exceeding five years, any lot or any part of a lot in a subdivision, before the
provisions of these Regulations are complied with, shall forfeit and pay the

dollars ($500.00), for each lot or part of a lot so sold, offered for sale or
leased, to be recovered with costs in a civil action brought in the name of the

1246.01  COMPENSATION; POWERS AND DUTIES.
   (a)   The members of the Board of Zoning Appeals shall serve without
compensation.
   (b)   The Board shall have all the powers and duties prescribed by law,
specifically including hearing appeals as to the interpretation of this Zoning
Code and granting variances for hardships.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1246.02  APPEALS AS TO INTERPRETATION.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to hear and decide appeals
concerning an alleged error or an interpretation, order, requirement, decision
or determination of the Zoning Inspector in the administration and enforcement
of this Zoning Code. Such question of interpretation may include a
determination of:
   (a)   The meaning of any portion of the text of this Zoning Code or any
condition or requirement made under the provisions of this Zoning Code or of
any order previously issued by the Board;
   (b)   The exact location of any zoning district boundary, if uncertainty
remains after following the rules specified in Section
1248.04;
   (c)   Whether a proposed nonconforming use is of a more restricted nature
than the existing nonconforming use that is proposed to be replaced, as
provided in Section
1282.02; and
   (d)   Alleged inaction or improper action by the Zoning Inspector as the
same relates to the application of zoning laws in the City. Appeals shall be
prepared in written form and shall specify the grounds thereof, setting forth
the material subject matter sufficiently to identify the matters involved upon
appeal. A copy thereof shall be filed with the Board and with the Zoning
Inspector, who shall then forthwith prepare and transmit to the Board all
papers and records of his or her office bearing thereon.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1246.03  VARIANCES.
   (a)   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to consider variances
from these regulations where, by reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness,
shape, exceptional topography or similar unusual condition of a given lot, the
strict application of the terms of this Zoning Code would result in peculiar
and exceptional difficulties or undue hardship upon the owner thereof.
Variances may only be granted from the measurable standards that apply within a
given zoning district. The Board may include special conditions and
requirements as described in Section
1246.04 as a condition of approval. Examples of authorized variances include
finding that unique physical circumstances apply in a given circumstance and:
      (1)   Allowing any front, side or rear setback requirement to be reduced;
      (2)   Allowing a structure to be built on a lot that does not meet the
required lot size for the zoning district in which it is located;
      (3)   Allowing off-street parking and/or loading requirements to be
reduced;
      (4)   Allowing signs with larger area to be constructed or placed on a
property; and
      (5)   Allowing a structure that does not meet maximum or minimum gross
floor area requirements.
   (b)   All required forms, applications, information and fees shall be
submitted at least ten working days prior to scheduled meeting date. In cases
where a variance is requested for something that has already been done, an
application fee of one hundred dollars ($100.00) shall apply and if the request
is approved, the zoning permit is double the usual fee. Under normal
circumstances, the application fee is twenty-five dollars ($25.00).
   (c)    Applications for variance requests may be taken by the Zoning
Inspector. The Board shall grant such variance permits only if the same will
not result in substantial detriment to the public good and will not
substantially impair the intent and general purpose of this Zoning Code.
Further, such variance permits shall be granted only if the Board finds that
all of the following conditions exist:
      (1)   The special circumstances or conditions applying to the building or
land in question are peculiar to such lot and do not apply generally to other
lots or buildings in the immediate vicinity.
      (2)   The granting of the variance permit is necessary for the
preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right and not merely to
serve as a convenience to the applicant.
      (3)   The special conditions and circumstances do not result from the
actions of the applicant.
      (4)   The issuance of the variance permit will not impair an adequate
supply of light and air to adjacent property, unreasonably increase the
congestion in public streets, increase the danger of fire, imperil the public
safety, unreasonably diminish or impair established property values within the
surrounding area or in any other respect impair the health, safety, convenience
or general welfare of the inhabitants of the City. Variance permits issued
pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be in writing and shall set
forth the exact nature of the variance permitted and all conditions and
requirements exacted by the Board in connection therewith. A copy or other
record thereof shall be kept by the Board, and a copy shall be furnished to the
Zoning Inspector.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals is restricted from granting a permanent variance
under any condition for a temporary fixture other than those expressed above.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1246.04  SPECIAL CONDITIONS AND REQUIREMENTS.
   In granting a variance, the Board may require other improvements and
safeguards for the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the owners
and occupants of the surrounding neighborhood. Specifically, the Board, in such
cases, may attach conditions that deal with a variety of concerns, including,
but not necessarily limited to, the following:

   (b)   The control or elimination of smoke, dust, radiation, vibration, gas,

Inspector shall be taken except upon concurrence of a majority of the members

1250.15  WIND TURBINES.
   Unless otherwise specifically provided, wind turbines shall be a conditional
use in all districts under the following conditions:
   (a)   The maximum height of any wind turbine for the private generation
shall be 40 feet. For purposes of the particular zoning item, “maximum height”
shall be considered the total vertical height calculated by measuring the
length of the blade or vane at the maximum vertical rotation to the original/
normal grade.
   (b)   The maximum height of any wind turbine for public or commercial
generation shall be reviewed and determined by the Planning Commission on a
case by case basis. Maximum height shall be measured the same as a private wind
turbine.
   (c)   Setbacks.  The following shall apply in regards to setbacks:
      (1)   Any wind turbine erected on parcel of land will need to establish a
“clear fall zone” equal to the maximum height of the wind turbine from all
neighboring property lines, structures, as well as any structures on the parcel
intended for the wind turbine. A wind turbine will need to be erected and
placed in such a manner that if it were to fall, whatever direction the fall
occurs would be contained safely on the property where the wind turbine is
located, and would not strike any structures including the primary dwelling,
and any accessory buildings or uses.
   (d)   Aesthetics.  The following provisions shall be applied to the
aesthetics issue of wind turbines:
      (1)   The wind turbine, including the prop blade or vanes, turbine,
cowling, nacelle, and tower shall be painted or coated white, gray, or sky
blue. Logos, signs or other identification markers other than those of the
manufacturer and model type shall not be permitted anywhere on the wind
turbine.
   (e)   Noise.  Broadband noise from any wind turbine shall be limited to no
more than ten decibels above the original ambient baseline sound level (or that
level which is exceeded 90% of the time) beyond the property line, considering
both daytime and night measurements as reported in the engineer's sound
propagation model required in division (g)(3)K.4. of this section. The day and
night requirements will be different. The harmonic mean of the night
measurements will set the baseline for night noise limits and the harmonic mean
of the daytime measurements will set the baseline for daytime limits. Pure
tones defined as an octave band (at any frequency) are limited to no more than
three decibels above the adjacent higher and lower octave bands.
   (f)   Ice. The potential ice throw or ice shedding for the wind turbine
shall not cross the property lines of the site in question nor impinge on any
public right-of-way or overhead utility line. Compliance shall be demonstrated
in the zoning certificate application by specific analysis method, but such
model shall not alleviate the applicant of the need to comply with this
subsection under all atmospheric conditions, for the life of the structure.
This standard shall not apply to an anemometer tower.
   (g)   Zoning Certificate Application.
      (1)   A zoning certificate shall be required before construction can
commence on a wind turbine system or anemometer tower.
      (2)   As part of the application process, the applicant shall provide
written documentation that the applicant has notified the FAA, Toledo Metcalf
Field and any other applicable State and Federal regulatory agencies of the
proposed wind turbine system or anemometer tower.

the City a report prepared by a professional engineer with the following
information:
         A.   The total size of the wind turbine unit.
         B.   The total size and height of the tower, pole, or support
structure including sealed structural design calculations from a professional
engineer.
         C.   The total size and depth of the concrete foundation including
sealed foundation design calculations from a professional engineer.
         D.   A list and or depiction of all safety measures that will be on
the unit, including anti-climb device, grounding devices, and lighting
protection.
         E.   Data specifying the kilowatt size and generating capacity of the
wind turbine unit.
         F.   A sealed site drawing showing the location of the unit feet and
inches in relation to existing structures on the site, roads and other public
right-of-ways, and neighboring properties and structures.
         G.   Evidence of a “clear fall zone” shall be shown on the site
drawing with manufacturing recommendations.
         H.   Color of the unit as well as the location and size of the
manufacturers identifying logos shall be included in the drawings.
         I.   A maintenance schedule as well as a dismantling plan that
outlines how the unit will be dismantled shall be required as part of the
zoning certification.
         J.   Documentation that the site of the wind turbine has sufficient
wind resources for the proposed wind turbine equipment.
         K.   Analysis, measurements and projections of wind turbine noise
propagation shall conform to the International Electromechanical Commission
(IEC) Standard 614-00-11 Part 11, as that standard may be amended or updated
from time to time. Acoustic Noise Measurement Techniques, with optional noise
directivity requirements (see below), infrasound (low frequency) projections,
low frequency noise (between 20 and 100 Hz) measurement and analysis and
impulsivity measurement (noise pressure of potential “thumping” sounds).
Analysis shall, include but not limited to:
            1.   A survey of the existing ambient background noise levels.
Analysis shall include day time measurements and also at least two ambient
noise measurements between 9:00 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. and two between 1:00 a.m.
and 5:00 a.m.
            2.   A prediction of the WTG noise levels at the property border.
This can be made with manufacturer's data or data from a private testing agency
for proposed WTGs or by direct measurement for WTGs in place, so long as
measurements are conducted according to IEC and 614-00-11 Part 11 as that
standard may be amended or updated from time to time. Including infrasound and
low frequency noise between 20 and 100 Hz, modeling must identify likely pure
tone sources.
            3.   Identification and support for a model for sound propagation.
The model may be hemispherical or spherical but particular attention must be
paid to the noise propagation downwind of the proposed installation site and
the propagation of sound at different atmospheric densities.
            4.   A comparison of calculated wind sound pressure levels with and
without the WTG or proposed WTGs. This confirms the baseline for permitted
sound levels once the WTGs are operating.
         *   This application requirement shall not apply to any anemometer
tower.
   (h)   Anemometer and Anemometer Tower.  The anemometer and anemometer tower
shall comply with the setback, height and other requirements for the wind
turbines except where indicated in this section.
   (i)   Removal of Wind Turbine and Anemometer Towers.  Wind turbine
anemometer towers that are not operated for a continuous period of 12 months
shall be removed by the owner of the wind turbine or anemometer tower within 90
days of receipt of a notice from the City requiring such removal. For purposes
of this section, non-operation shall be deemed to include, but shall not be
limited to, the anemometer instrument(s) being removed from the anemometer
tower or disconnected so that wind resources are no longer being measured, the
blades of the wind turbine remaining stationary so that wind resources are not
being converted into electric or mechanical energy, or the wind turbine is no
longer connected to the public utility electricity distribution system. In the
event a wind turbine owner fails to remove the wind turbine tower or the
anemometer tower as required by this section, the City shall have the authority
to remove the tower and shall assess the property owner to cover the costs of
such removal.
   (j)   Duration of Permit.  A permit to operate a temporary anemometer tower
shall be valid for one year and may be extended for a maximum of one additional
year. A permit to operate a wind turbine shall be valid for 20 years.
   (k)   Use of Current Technology.  Wind turbines shall be designed to the
current state of the technology. Used, outdated or obsolete wind turbine
equipment shall not be permitted to be constructed or installed. With respect
to performance standards set forth in this section, repairs and parts
replacement shall not be of lesser quality than that of the original permitted
equipment and shall be upgraded to the performance standards current at the
time of the repair. In no case shall repairs or alterations be allowed which
will decrease the degree to which the wind turbine complies with this section.
   (l)   Major Equipment Replacement During Life of the Permit.  Should the
wind turbine operator wish to replace major components such as turbine blades,

1280.01  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Planned Unit Development Overlay District (PUD) is to
provide an alternative overlay zoning district that is intended to encourage
innovative design of development. The PUD should be a well-integrated
development in terms major design elements, such as streets, drainage systems,
sanitary sewer systems, waterlines, utilities, sidewalks, street lighting,
landscaping and open space. The PUD allows greater design flexibility so that
natural features and open space may be preserved and enhanced and development
concentrated in a coordinated and efficient manner.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.02  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   A PUD may be located in any area of the City where the applicant can prove
that a proposed development would meet the purposes of this chapter. The PUD
may be overlaid over any residential, commercial or industrial zoning district
or may be a combination of uses, such as residential and commercial or
commercial and industrial or residential, commercial and industrial. The tract
of land proposed to be developed as a PUD must be owned, leased or controlled
by one person or a single entity and must be at least ten continuous acres for
residential use, at least fifteen continuous acres for commercial use, or at
least twenty-five continuous acres for industrial use.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.03  USES PERMITTED.
   An applicant may propose to include any mixture of land uses which are
listed as permitted, or conditionally permitted, in any zoning district, with
the following limitations: The proposed location of commercial and industrial
uses shall not have an adverse impact upon adjacent property or the public
health and welfare, safety and morals.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.04  DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS.
   The following standards represent broad parameters under which all PUD
developments must be designed:
   (a)   Central Water and Sewer Facilities. All structures in developments
approved as a PUD must be served by public water and storm and sanitary sewer
facilities.
   (b)   Residential Development. Clustering residential density is permitted
and encouraged to provide required common open space. The density of the land
use shall in no case be more than allowed in the conventional underlaying
residential zoning district. The maximum impervious surface proposed must not
exceed sixty percent of the total developed residential area. An area that is
no less than forty percent of the residential area shall be devoted to useful
and desirable common open space established to provide recreational
opportunities and to preserve unique environmental features on the site.
   (c)   Commercial Development. Area requirements, building heights and
parking and loading requirements shall in no case be more than allowed in the
conventional underlaying commercial zoning district. The maximum impervious
surface proposed must not exceed eighty percent of the total developed
commercial area. The maximum building coverage shall not exceed fifty percent.
An area that is no less than twenty percent of the commercial area shall be
devoted to useful and desirable common open space established to provide
recreational opportunities and to preserve unique environmental features on the
site.
   (d)   Industrial Development. Area requirements, building heights, and
parking and loading requirements shall in no case be more than allowed in the
conventional underlaying industrial zoning district. The maximum impervious
surface proposed must not exceed eighty-five percent of the total developed
industrial area. The maximum building coverage shall not exceed fifty-five
percent. An area that is no less than fifteen percent of the industrial area
shall be devoted to useful and desirable common open space established to
provide recreational opportunities and to preserve unique environmental
features on the site.
   (e)   Development Layout and Design. Specific residential density, as well
as the development intensity of nonresidential uses and the development design
and layout, shall be based on the applicant's ability to provide sufficient
evidence to the Planning Commission and Council that the complete development
displays excellence in design by properly considering any significant natural
and historic features, the topography, natural drainage patterns, roadway
access and circulation, surrounding land uses, the enhancement of the general
welfare of the public and aesthetically desirable land development.
   (f)   Landscape Plan. A landscape plan shall be provided with each PUD
development. Attractive landscaped buffer and areas shall be provided between
incompatible land uses and activities, according to Section
1250.10.
   (g)   Front, Side and Rear Setback Standards for Perimeter Lots. All lots
that are located along the perimeter of the PUD shall have a minimum front,
side and rear setback equal to those that would normally be specified in the
underlaying conventional zoning district for the particular land use.
   (h)   Common Open Space. The required amount of common open space for each
district shall be established as open space forever, and provisions shall be
established for the maintenance and care thereof. The legal articles relating
to any organization of property owners in the development charged with such
open space maintenance is subject to review and approval by the City Attorney.
The Planning Commission and/or Council may require, as a condition of final
approval, any evidence deemed necessary to document that the required common
space will remain in its stated condition forever, such evidence to include
such legal documents as deed restrictions, conservation easements, etc.
   (i)   Front, Side and Rear Setback Standards for Interior Lots. Within the
PUD, there shall be no minimum lot size, lot width or building setback
requirements, except as provided in Section
1280.04(g).
   (j)   Off-Street Parking and Loading Facilities. For all land uses located
within the PUD, the parking and loading standards contained in Sections
1282.04 and
1282.05 shall apply.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.05  GENERAL PUD APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   The applicant for a PUD must submit a sketch plan along with a preliminary
plan and a final development plan. The property must also be rezoned to PUD
Overlay District, and the decision to approve a final development plan and to
rezone a property to a PUD Overlay District are made concurrently. The final
development plan, with all conditions, stipulations and requirements, shall
constitute the zoning requirements for the particular property. All development
restrictions described in the final development plan and supporting documents
become the official zoning requirements of the property. This review procedure
is intended to reflect the subdivision review procedure to provide for timely
and concurrent zoning and subdivision review.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.06  PRELIMINARY SKETCH AND DEVELOPMENT PLAN SUBMISSION.
   (a)   Following the submission and review of a conceptual sketch plan
according to Section
1222.06(c) of the Subdivision Regulations, the applicant shall submit ten
copies of a proposed preliminary plan to the Zoning Inspector, along with the
required application fee. The proposed preliminary development plan shall
include all items required of a preliminary drawing of a subdivision, as
described in Section
1222.06(f) through (i) of the Subdivision Regulations.
   (b)   The Planning Commission may also, at its sole discretion, require
additional information such as maps, data or reports, including environmental
impact studies and an archaeological survey of the property, prepared by an
appropriate professional. The applicant shall be responsible for all reasonable
expenses incurred by the City in reviewing the preliminary and final
development plans or any modifications thereof. Such expenses shall be in
addition to the application fees established by Council and may include
professional service fees incurred in connection with reviewing the plans and
prepared reports, such as legal fees and fees for the services of other
professionals such as geologists, landscape architects, planners, engineers,
environmental scientists or architects.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.07  PRELIMINARY PLAN REVIEW.
   Not less than twenty, nor more than fifty days following the submission of
the required information, a public hearing on the preliminary plan shall be
scheduled. Notice of this hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation at least fifteen days before such hearing.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.08  CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF A PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   Within thirty days following the public hearing provided for in Section
1280.07, the Planning Commission shall act to approve, disapprove or
conditionally approve the preliminary plan according to the following criteria:
   (a)   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan;
   (b)   That the benefits, improved arrangement and design of the proposed
development justify the deviation from standard development requirements
included in this Zoning Code;
   (c)   That the uses requested in the proposal are compatible with
surrounding land uses;
   (d)   That there are adequate public services, such as utilities, fire
protection and emergency service, available to serve the proposed development;
   (e)   That the proposed development will not create overcrowding and/or
traffic hazards on existing roads and/or intersections;
   (f)   That the arrangement of land uses on the site shall properly consider
topography, significant natural features, natural drainage patterns, views and
roadway access;
   (g)   That the clustering of development sites is shown to preserve any
natural or historic features and provide usable common open space;
   (h)   That the proposed road circulation system is integrated and
coordinated to include a hierarchical interconnection of interior roads as well
as adequate outer-connection of interior collector streets with off-site road
systems;
   (i)   That there are adequate buffers between incompatible land uses; and
   (j)   That the Planning Commission is satisfied that the developer possesses
the requisite financial resources to begin the project within the required two
years.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.09  EFFECT OF APPROVAL OF THE PRELIMINARY DEVELOPMENT PLAN.
   The Planning Commission approval of a preliminary plan will be considered an
approval of the preliminary development plan in principle only. Approval of the
preliminary plan shall not, therefore, be construed to approve any development
on the site, nor shall it be construed to absolutely endorse a precise location
of uses, shapes of parcels or engineering feasibility. Approval of the
preliminary development plan is necessary, however, before the applicant may
submit a final development plan to the Planning Commission and Council for
approval and rezoning to PUD Overlay District.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.10  FINAL PLAN.
   The applicant shall submit ten copies of the proposed final plan to the
Zoning Inspector, along with the required application fee. The final plan shall
include all of the information required for a final plat as described in
Section
1222.06(q) and (r) of the Subdivision Regulations, together with:
   (a)   The specific description of permitted, conditionally permitted and
accessory uses to be allowed in each area of the development; and
   (b)   A copy of the proposed deed restrictions.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.11  FINAL PLAN APPROVAL AND REZONING APPROVAL PROCEDURE.
   The decision to rezone land to a PUD Overlay District and to approve the
final plan are technically separate decisions. However, to provide for the
efficient and timely processing of both the rezoning request and the request
for final plan approval, all PUD final plan submissions are deemed to be an
application for amendment to the Zoning Code, according to
Chapter 1242. All procedures, from Planning Commission review to a public
hearing and final approval by Council, shall be followed in considering an
application for a rezoning of the land in question to a PUD Overlay District.
Upon approval of such application to rezone the property in question to a PUD
Overlay District, the Zoning District Map of the City shall be amended to
designate the project area as a “PUD” Overlay District. Thereafter, with the
concurrent approval of the rezoning and the final plan, all development
restrictions and conditions described in the final plan shall become official
requirements of the PUD.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.12  CRITERIA FOR APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAN.
   In addition to review as a subdivision, the Planning Commission and Council
shall review the proposed final plan according to the following criteria:
   (a)   That the proposed development is in conformity with the goals and
objectives of the Comprehensive Plan;
   (b)   That the proposed development advances the general health, safety and
morals of the residents of the City;
   (c)   That the Planning Commission and Council are satisfied that the
developer possesses the requisite financial resources to begin the project
within the required two years;
   (d)   That the interior road system, proposed parking and any off-site
improvements are suitable and adequate to carry anticipated traffic generated
by the proposed development;
   (e)   That any exception from standard District requirements can be
warranted by design and other amenities incorporated in the final development
plan, according to these PUD requirements;
   (f)   That the area surrounding said development can be planned and zoned in
coordination and substantial compatibility with the proposed development; and
   (g)   That the existing and proposed utilities, including water and sewer
service, and the drainage plan will be adequate for the population densities
and nonresidential uses proposed in the PUD.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.13  APPROVAL OF FINAL PLAT.
   The Planning Commission shall act on the proposed PUD as a final plat of a
subdivision, as described in Section
1222.06(t) through (v). (See Appendix D, Plat Approval Flowchart.)
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.14  CHANGES TO APPROVED PLAN.
   Changes or alterations to the development plan as approved by the Planning
Commission and Council may be administratively reviewed and approved by the
Zoning Inspector, except in the following circumstances:
   (a)   Change in the overall acreage of the development;
   (b)   Any change in use in the overall development;
   (c)   Alterations to open space areas and their location(s);
   (d)   Change in the landscape plan;
   (e)   Change in street pattern;
   (f)   An increase in the number of units originally proposed;
   (g)   Changes in the building/building envelope location(s); and
   (h)   Change to establish setbacks.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1280.15  EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION OF APPROVAL PERIOD.
   If construction of any phase of the approved PUD begins within two years
after approval is granted, the approval shall be valid until the development is
completed. If no construction has begun or is substantially completed within
two years after the approval is granted, the approved development plan shall be
void and the land shall revert to the district regulations in which it is
located. An extension of the time limit may be approved by the Planning
Commission, if such extension is not in conflict with the public interest.

1282.01  APPLICATION OF CHAPTER.
   In addition to the regulations set forth elsewhere in this Zoning Code, the
following regulations shall apply to all districts.
(Ord. 2002-45. Passed 8-22-02.)
1282.02  NONCONFORMING USES AND LOTS.
   (a)   Nonconforming Uses. A nonconforming use which was made of land before
the first effective date of any zoning regulation with which such use does not
conform, may be continued as herein provided, but not otherwise. No such
permitted nonconforming use shall be enlarged, extended or changed, nor shall
any structural alteration be made to any building or other structure in which
such nonconforming use is conducted, except as provided herein:
      (1)   Changes. A nonconforming use may be changed to any conforming use.
A nonconforming use may be changed to another nonconforming use by special
permission of the Board of Zoning Appeals as provided for in Section
1246.02. Such special permission may be granted only if the Board finds, after
a public hearing, that such changed use is of a more restricted nature than the
existing nonconforming use.
      (2)   Discontinuances. If active and continuous operation of a
nonconforming use is ceased for a continuous period of two years, or is changed
to or replaced by a conforming use, the building, other structure or lot
previously devoted to such nonconforming use shall thereafter be occupied and
used only for a conforming use, according to all the use regulations of the
district in which such building, other structure or lot is located. Any intent
to resume active operations shall not affect the foregoing.
      (3)   Damage and destruction. If a building or other structure containing
a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, such building or
other structure may be reconstructed or restored and thereafter occupied and
used only for a conforming use, except that a residential structure can be
rebuilt as a matter of right even if such residential structure would not be a
conforming use, provided that a permit to rebuild is applied for within one
year from the date of destruction and provided, further, that construction is
complete within one year from the date of the application for the permit to
rebuild.
      (4)   Extensions. The Board may permit, after a public hearing, the
extension of a nonconforming building upon a lot occupied by such building or
on an adjoining lot, provided that such lot was under the same ownership as the
lot in question at the time the use of such building became nonconforming, and
that such extension is necessary and incidental to such existing nonconforming
use. The extent of such extension shall not exceed, in all, ten percent of the
existing ground floor area of the existing building devoted to a nonconforming
use, and such extension shall be within a distance of not more than twenty-five
feet of the existing building or premises. Only one such extension shall be
permitted. The Board may also permit, after a public hearing, the extension of
a nonconforming use subject to the limitations set forth above and further
subject to the Board finding that such extended nonconforming use will not be
more harmful or objectionable to the surrounding area or impair the orderly
development of the Municipality.
      (5)   Repairs and structural alterations. Nothing in this section shall
be deemed to prevent normal maintenance and repair of a building or other
structure containing a nonconforming use. Structural alterations may be made to
a building or other structure containing a nonconforming use as follows:
         A.   When required by law; or
         B.   When a building or other structure containing residential
nonconforming uses may be so altered as to improve interior livability.
However, no such structural alterations shall be made in excess of the area,
height or yard limits of the district in which such building is located.
   (b)   Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any district in which single-family
dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and its customary accessory
buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of
the adoption or amendment of this Zoning Code, notwithstanding limitations
imposed by other provisions of this Zoning Code. Such lot must be in separate
ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership.
   If two or more lots, or a combination of lots and portions of lots with
continuous frontage in single ownership, are of record at the time of the
passage or amendment of this Zoning Code, and if all or part of the lots with
no buildings do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area,
the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for purposes
of this section, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a
manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements
established in this Zoning Code, nor shall any division of any parcel be made
which creates a lot with a width or area below the requirements stated in this
Zoning Code.

ordered to abate the nuisance within thirty (30) days, may appeal the notice-

1284.07  FIRE DAMAGED STRUCTURES; REPAIR OR REMOVAL FUND.
   (a)   No insurance company doing business in the State shall pay a claim of
named insured for fire damage for a structure located within the City where the
amount recoverable for the fire loss to the structure under all insurance
policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000) and is greater than or equal to
sixty percent (60%) of all fire insurance policy monetary limitations unless
there is compliance with the following procedures:
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds sixty percent
(60%) of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the
building or structure, the insurance company or companies in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.26(F) and 3929.86(C) and (D) shall transfer from the insurance
proceeds to the Director of Finance in the aggregate amount of two thousand
dollars ($2,000) for each fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), and each fraction
of that amount, of a claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to
between the named insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies
the named insured or insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of
the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other structure,
shall transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the
estimate.
         A.   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure. Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the City may be disbursed in accordance with the policy terms.

estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Finance Director, after notifying the
City Administrator, shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the
estimate to the named insured or insureds, provided that the City has not
commenced to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the City as authorized by this section,
the Finance Director shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be used
solely as security against the total cost of removing, repair or securing
incurred by the City pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
         A.   When transferring the fund as required in subsection (a)(1)
hereof, an insurance company shall provide the City with the name and address
of the named insured or insureds whereupon the City shall contact the named
insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by the City
and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
         B.   The fund shall be returned by the Finance Director to the named
insured or insureds when repairs, or removal, or securing of the building or
other structure have been completed and the required proof is received by the
City Administrator, provided that the City has not incurred any costs for such
repairs, removals or securing. If the City has incurred any costs for repairs,
removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs shall be
paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the City of Northwood shall
transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds after repair,
rebuilding or removal has been completed.
         C.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to limit the ability
of the City to recover any deficiency under Ohio R.C. 715.261. Nothing in Ohio
R.C. 3929.86(C) and (D) adopted hereby shall be construed to prohibit the City
and the named insured or insureds from entering into an agreement that permits
the transfer of funds to the named insured or insureds if some other reasonable
disposition of the damaged property has been negotiated.
   (b)   The Finance Director is hereby designated as the officer authorized to
carry out the duties of this section, provided that no funds so held under this
section shall be released without notification of such intent to the City
Administrator.

create a more attractive economic and business climate, and to enhance and
protect the physical appearance of the community.  It is further intended to
facilitate economic and residential development by requiring demolition sites
to be rendered clear and ready for future construction, thus promoting
development or, in the alternative, to ensure that demolition sites are
returned to their pre-built natural state, thus promoting open space and
curbing the deterioration of the natural environment.

site has been covered with dirt and brought back level to grade. Once brought
to grade, the site shall be seeded (and protected from soil erosion until seeds
take hold) or such other landscaping as may be appropriate shall be planted,
subject to the approval of the Building and Zoning Administrator.
   (c)   The approval of any demolition permit is provisional, and shall not be
considered final for the purposes of commencing work, unless the applicant has
completed the following additional requirements:

criteria of subsection (a) hereof shall require a demolition permit.
   (d)   For the purposes of permits issued under subsection (a) hereof, the
date on which work is considered to have commenced shall be the date on which
demolition begins on the site, and all work (including both demolition and new
construction) shall be completed in a manner and within the timeframe provided
for by law, subject to such extensions or allowances as would typically be

the property owner, such as fire, tornado, earthquake, Act of God, or the like,
the structure is not considered demolished for the purposes of this Code. 
Reconstruction of a new structure may utilize the existing foundation, if it
remains sound and viable for such use. If no reconstruction is planned within
twelve months of the date on which the structure was destroyed, the foundation
must be removed from the site as described in Section
1286.03(b).  A demolition permit shall be required for such removal.
   (b)   All persons demolishing structures in the City shall take care to
properly preserve and protect any utility service lines or delivery conduits

1286.03(a) and (b), such bond to be in the form of a surety or maintenance
bond, escrow account, irrevocable letter of credit, or a cash deposit.
   (b)   Performance bonds provided for under this section shall be posted in
amounts equal to twice the cost of work to be performed, but no bond shall be
posted for a demolition in an amount less than five thousand dollars ($5,000).
(Ord. 2012-26.  Passed 5-24-12.)
1286.07   NON-APPLICATION TO CITY CONDUCTED DEMOLITION.

this chapter, or whosoever does so without the appropriate permit as required
by law, or whosoever does so without properly restoring the site as required in
Section
1286.03 shall be subject to the following:
      (1)   Whoever violates this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of
the fourth degree and penalties shall be imposed as set forth in Section
698.02; and

1286.03(e) or with the applicable provisions of the Ohio Revised Code dealing
with asbestos containing materials, may result in additional fines and

1420.01 1998 EDITION ADOPTED.
   Pursuant to Ohio R.C. 731.231, there is hereby adopted by and for the
Municipality the Ohio Basic Building Code, being particularly the 1998 edition
thereof, as adopted by the Ohio Board of Building Standards, Department of
Industrial Relations, and published in Division 4101:2 of the Ohio
Administrative Code, save and except such portions as are hereinafter modified
or deleted, and the same are hereby incorporated by reference as if fully
rewritten herein.
1420.02  PURPOSE OF CODE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Basic Building Code, as adopted in Section
1420.01, is to:
   (a)    Provide uniform standards and requirements for the erection,
construction, repair, alteration and maintenance of buildings, including
construction of industrialized units. Such standards shall relate to the
conservation of energy, safety and sanitation of buildings for their intended
use and occupancy.
   (b)    Formulate such standards and requirements, so far as is practical, in
terms of performance objectives, so as to make adequate performance for the use
intended the test of acceptability;
   (c)    Permit, to the fullest extent feasible, the use of materials and
technical methods, devices and improvements, including the use of
industrialized units that tend to reduce the cost of construction and erection
without affecting minimum requirements for the health, safety and security of
the occupants or users of buildings or industrialized units and without
preferential treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods
of construction; and
   (d)    Encourage, so far as may be practical, the standardization of
construction practices, methods, equipment, material and techniques, including
methods employed to produce industrialized units.

1456.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION; FINDINGS OF FACT; PURPOSE AND OBJECTIVES.
   (a)   Statutory Authorization. The Legislature of the State has, in Ohio
R.C. 715.37, delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt
regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare
of its citizenry. Therefore, Council hereby ordains this chapter.
   (b)   Findings of Fact.
      (1)   The flood hazard areas of the Village are subject to period
inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety
hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public
expenditures for flood protection and relief and impairment of the tax base,
all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.
      (2)   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and
velocities and, when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses
that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood
damage also contribute to the flood loss.
   (c)   Statement of Purpose. It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private
losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
      (1)   Protect human life and health;
      (2)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
      (3)    Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; (4)
Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
      (5)    Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water
and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges
located in areas of special flood hazard;
      (6)    Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use
and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood
blight areas;
      (7)    Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an
area of special flood hazard; and
      (8)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard
assume responsibility for their actions.
   (d)    Methods of Reducing Flood Losses. In order to accomplish its
purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:
      (1)    Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health,
safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging
increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
      (2)    Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities
which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
      (3)    Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream
channels and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel
flood waters;
      (4)    Controlling filling, grading, dredging and other development which
may increase flood damage; and
      (5)    Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 77-65. Passed 10-13-77.)
1456.02  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter
shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage
and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. As used in this
chapter:
   (a)    “Area of special flood hazard” means the land in the flood plain
within a community subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in
any given year.
   (b)    “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year.
   (c)    “Development” means any man-made change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures and
mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations
located within the area of special flood hazard.
   (d)    “Flood” or “flooding” means a general and temporary condition of
partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)    The overflow of inland or tidal waters; and/or
      (2)    The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters
from any source.
   (e)    “Flood Hazard Boundary Map” (FHBM) means the official map issued by
the Federal Insurance Administration where the areas of special flood hazard
have been designated Zone A.
   (f)    “Habitable floor” means any floor usable for living purposes, which
includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation or a combination
thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a “habitable floor. “
   (g)    “Mobile home” means a structure that is transportable in one or more
sections, built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without
a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. It does not
include recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
   (h)    “Structure” means a walled and roofed building or mobile home that is
principally above ground.
   (i)    “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction or
improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent
of the market value of the structure either:
      (1)    Before the improvement or repair is started; or
      (2)    If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before
the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, “substantial
improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall,
ceiling, floor or other structural part of the building commences, whether or
not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.
      The term does not, however, include either:
      (3)    Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing
State or local health, sanitary or Safety Code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions ; or
      (4)    Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or a State Inventory of Historic Places.
(Ord. 77-65. Passed 10-13-77.)
1456.03  GENERAL PROVISIONS.
   (a)    Lands to Which This Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all
areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the Village.
   (b)    Basis for Establishing The Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas
of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in
its Flood Hazard Boundary Map (FHBM), No. H02-H03-H01-HO1-03, dated October 13,
1977, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this
chapter. The FHBM is on file at the Clerk-Treasurer's office.
   (c)    Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed,
located, extended, converted or altered without full compliance with the
provisions of this chapter and other applicable regulations.
   (d)    Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter is not intended to
repeal, abrogate or impair any existing easement, covenant or deed restriction.
However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed
restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent
restriction shall prevail.
   (e)    Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
chapter, all provisions shall be:
      (1)    Considered as minimum requirements;
      (2)    Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and
      (3)    Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other power granted under
State statutes.
   (f)    Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection
required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and
is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and
will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or
natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of
special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part
of the Village, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Insurance
Administration, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this chapter
or on any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 77-65. Passed 10-13-77.)
1456.04  ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)    Development Permits. A development permit shall be obtained before
construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard as
established in Section
1456.03(b). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms
furnished by the Clerk-Treasurer and may include, but not be limited to, plans
in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions and
elevations of the area in question, existing or proposed structures, fill,
storage of materials, drainage facilities and the location of the foregoing.
Specifically, the following information is required:
      (1)    The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor
(including the basement) of all structures;
      (2)    The elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
structure has been floodproofed;
      (3)    Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect
that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the
floodproofing criteria in Section
1456.05(b)(2); and
      (4)    A description of the extent to which any watercourse will be
altered or relocated as a result of the proposed development.
   (b)    Authority of Clerk-Treasurer. The Clerk-Treasurer is hereby appointed
to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying development
permit applications in accordance with its provisions.
   (c)    Duties and Responsibilities of Clerk-Treasurer. The duties of the
Clerk-Treasurer shall include, but not be limited to, the following:
      (1)    Permit review.
         A.    He shall review all development permits to determine that the
permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied.
         B.    He shall review all development permits to determine that all
necessary permits have been obtained from those Federal, State or local
governmental agencies from which prior approval is required.
         C.    He shall review all development permits to determine if the
proposed development adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the area
of special flood hazard. For the purposes of this chapter, “adversely affects”
means damage to adjacent properties because of rises in flood stages attributed
to physical changes of the channel and the adjacent overbank areas.
            1.    If it is determined that there is no adverse effect and the
development is not a building, then the permit shall be granted without further
consideration.
            2.    If it is determined that there is an adverse effect, then
technical justification (i. e. a registered professional engineer) for the
proposed development shall be required.
            3.    If the proposed development is a building, then the
provisions of this chapter shall apply.
      (2)    Use of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has
not been provided in accordance with Section
1456.03(b), the Clerk-Treasurer shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any
base flood elevation data available from a Federal, State or other source, in
order to administer Section
1456.05(b).
      (3)    Information to be obtained and maintained.
         A.    He shall obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to
mean sea level, of the lowest habitable floor (including the basement) of all
new or substantially improved structures and determine and record whether or
not the structure contains a basement;
         B.    For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures,
he shall:
            1.    Obtain and record the actual elevation, in relation to mean
sea level, to which the structure has been floodproofed; and
            2.    Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Section
1456.04(a)(3).
         C.    He shall maintain for public inspection all records pertaining
to the provisions of this chapter.
      (4)    Alteration of watercourses.
         A.    He shall notify adjacent communities and the State Department of
Insurance prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse and submit
evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration.
         B.    He shall require that maintenance is provided within the altered
or relocated portion of such watercourse so that the flood carrying capacity is
not diminished.
      (5)    Interpretation of FHBM boundaries. He shall make interpretations,
where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of
special flood hazards, for example, where there appears to be a conflict
between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions.
(Ord. 77-65. Passed 10-13-77.)
1456.05  PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION.

1462.09  PERFORMANCE STANDARDS.
   The SWP3 must contain a description of the controls appropriate for each
construction operation and the applicant must implement such controls. The SWP3
must clearly describe for each major construction activity the appropriate
control measures; the general sequence during the construction process under
which the measures will be implemented; and the contractor responsible for
implementation (e.g., contractor A will clear land and install perimeter
controls and contractor B will maintain perimeter controls until final
stabilization).  The controls shall include the following minimum components:
   (a)   Non-Structural Preservation Measures. The SWP3 must make use of
practices that preserve the existing natural condition to the maximum extent
practicable. Such practices may include preserving riparian areas, preserving
existing vegetation and vegetative buffer strips, phasing of construction
operations in order to minimize the amount of disturbed land at any one time,
and designation of tree preservation areas or other protective clearing or
grubbing practices.
   (b)   Erosion Control Practices.  The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover. Erosion control practices must meet the following
requirements:
      (1)   Stabilization. Disturbed areas must be stabilized as specified in
Tables 1 and 2 below.
   Table 1: Permanent Stabilization
 
Area Requiring Permanent Stabilization  Time Frame to Apply Erosion Controls
Any area that will lie dormant for one  Within 7 days of the most recent

Disturbed areas that will be idle over   Prior to November 1.
winter.
Note: Where vegetative stabilization techniques may cause structural
instability or are otherwise unobtainable, alternative stabilization
techniques must be employed. These techniques may include mulching or erosion
matting.
 
      (2)   Permanent stabilization of conveyance channels. Applicants shall
undertake special measures to stabilize channels and outfalls and prevent
erosive flows. Measures may include seeding, dormant seeding, mulching, erosion
control matting, sodding, riprap, natural channel design with bioengineering
techniques, or rock check dams, all as defined in the most recent edition of
Rainwater and Land Development or the Field Office Technical Guide, available
at www.nres.usda.gov/technical/efotg/.
   (c)   Erosion Control Practices.  The SWP3 must make use of erosion controls
that are capable of providing cover over disturbed soils. A description of
control practices designed to restabilize disturbed areas after grading or
construction shall be included in the SWP3. The SWP3 must provide
specifications for stabilization of all disturbed areas of the site and provide
guidance as to which method of stabilization will be employed for any time of
the year. Such practices may include: temporary seeding, permanent seeding,
mulching, matting, sod stabilization, vegetative buffer strips, phasing of
construction operations, the use of construction entrances, and the use of
alternative ground cover.
   (d)   Sediment Control Practices. The SWP3 shall include a description of,
and detailed drawings for, all structural practices that shall store runoff,
allowing sediments to settle and/or divert flows away from exposed soils or
otherwise limit runoff from exposed areas. Structural practices shall be used
to control erosion and trap sediment from a site remaining disturbed for more
than 14 days. Such practices may include, among others: sediment settling
ponds, silt fences, storm drain inlet protection, and earth diversion dikes or
channels which direct runoff to a sediment settling pond. All sediment control
practices must be capable of ponding runoff in order to be considered
functional. Earth diversion dikes or channels alone are not considered a
sediment control practice unless used in conjunction with a sediment settling
pond. Sediment control practices must meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Timing. Sediment control structures shall be functional throughout
the course of earth-disturbing activity. Sediment basins and perimeter sediment
barriers shall be implemented prior to grading and within seven days from the
start of grubbing. They shall continue to function until the up slope
development area is restabilized. As construction progresses and the topography
is altered, appropriate controls must be constructed or existing controls
altered to address the changing drainage patterns.
      (2)   Sediment settling ponds. Concentrated storm water runoff and runoff
from drainage areas that exceed the design capacity of silt fence or inlet
protection, as determined in Table 3 below, shall pass through a sediment
settling pond or equivalent best management practice upon approval from the
City Engineer.
      The sediment-settling pond shall be sized to provide at least 67 cubic
yards of storage per acre of total contributing drainage area. When determining
the total contributing drainage area, off-site areas and areas which remain
undisturbed by construction activity must be included unless runoff from these
areas is diverted way from the sediment settling pond and is not co-mingled
with sediment-laden runoff. The depth of the sediment- settling pond must be
less than or equal to five feet The configuration between the inlets and the
outlet of the basin must provide at least two units of length for each one unit
of width (>2:1 length:width ratio). Sediment must be removed from the sediment
settling pond when the design capacity has been reduced by 40%. This limit is
typically reached when sediment occupies one-half of the basin depth. When
designing sediment settling ponds, the applicant must consider public safety,
especially as it relates to children, as a design factor for the sediment basin
and alternative sediment controls must be used where site limitations would
preclude a safe design. The use of a combination of sediment and erosion
control measures in order to achieve maximum pollutant removal is encouraged.
      (3)   Silt fence and diversions. Sheet flow runoff from denuded areas
shall be intercepted by silt fence or diversions to protect adjacent
properties, water resources, and wetlands from sediment transported via sheet
flow. Where intended to provide sediment control, silt fence shall be placed on
a level contour and shall be capable of temporarily ponding runoff. The
relationship between the maximum drainage area to silt fence for a particular
slope range is shown in Table 3 below. Storm water diversion practices shall be
used to keep runoff away from disturbed areas and steep slopes. Such devices,
which include swales, dikes or berms, may receive storm water runoff from areas
up to ten acres.
   Table 3: Maximum Drainage Area to Silt Fence
 
Maximum Drainage Area (Acres) to 100 Range of Slope for a Drainage Area (%)
Linear Feet of Silt Fence
0.5                                  <2%
0.25                                 > 2% but < 20%
0.125                                > 20% but < 50%
 
      (4)   Inlet protection. Erosion and sediment control practices, such as
boxed inlet protection, shall be installed to minimize sediment-laden water
entering active storm drain systems. Straw or hay bales are not acceptable
forms of inlet protection.
      (5)   Off-site tracking of sediment and dust control. Best management
practices must be implemented to ensure sediment is not tracked off-site and
that dust is controlled. These best management practices must include, but are
not limited to, the following:
         A.   Construction entrances shall be built and shall serve as the only
permitted points of ingress and egress to the development area. These entrances
shall be built of a stabilized pad of aggregate stone or recycled concrete or
cement sized greater than two inches in diameter, placed over a geotextile
fabric, and constructed in conformance with specifications in the most recent
edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Streets directly adjacent to construction entrances and receiving
traffic from the development area, shall be cleaned daily to remove sediment
racked off-site. If applicable, the catch basins on these streets nearest to
the construction entrances shall also be cleaned weekly.
      Based on site conditions, the City Engineer may require additional best
management practices to control off-site tracking and dust.  These additional
BMPs may include:
         C.   Silt fence or construction fence installed around the perimeter
of the development area to ensure that all vehicle traffic adheres to
designated construction entrances.
         D.   Designated wheel-washing areas. Wash water from these areas must
be directed to a designated sediment trap, the sediment-settling pond, or to a
sump pump for dewatering in conformance with Section
1462.09(g) of this regulation.
         E.   Applicants shall take all necessary measures to comply with
applicable regulations regarding fugitive dust emissions, including obtaining
necessary permits for such emissions. The City Engineer may require dust
controls, including the use of water trucks to wet disturbed areas, tarping
stockpiles, temporary stabilization of disturbed areas, and regulation of the
speed of vehicles on the site.
      (6)   Stream protection. Construction vehicles shall avoid water
resources and wetlands. If the applicant is permitted to disturb areas within
50 feet of a water resource or wetland, the following conditions shall be
addressed in the SWP3:
         A.   All BMPs and stream crossings shall be designed as specified in
the most recent edition of the Rainwater and Land Development Manual.
         B.   Structural practices shall be designated and implemented on-site
to protect water resources or wetlands from the impacts of sediment runoff.
         C.   No structural sediment controls (e.g., the installation of silt
fence or a sediment settling pond in-stream) shall be used in a water resource
or wetland.
         D.   Where stream crossings for roads or utilities are necessary and
permitted, the project shall be designed such that the number of stream
crossings and the width of the disturbance are minimized.
         E.   Temporary stream crossings shall be constructed if water
resources or wetlands will be crossed by construction vehicles during
construction.
         F.   Construction of bridges, culverts, or sediment control structures
shall not place soil, debris, or other particulate material into or close to
the water resources or wetlands in such a manner that it may slough, slip, or
erode.
      (7)   Modifying controls. If periodic inspections or other information
indicates a control has been used inappropriately or incorrectly, the applicant
shall replace or modify the control for site conditions.
   (e)   Non-Sediment Pollutant Controls.  No solid or liquid waste, including
building materials, shall be discharged in storm water runoff. The applicant
must implement site best management practices to prevent toxic materials,
hazardous materials, or other debris from entering water resources or wetlands.
These practices shall include but are not limited to the following:
      (1)   Waste materials.  A covered dumpster shall be made available for
the proper disposal of garbage, plaster, drywall, grout, gypsum, and other
waste materials.
      (2)   Concrete truck wash out.  The washing of concrete material into a
street, catch basin, or other public facility or natural resource is
prohibited. A designated area for concrete washout shall be made available.
      (3)   Fuel/liquid tank storage. All fuel/liquid tanks and drums shall be
stored in a marked storage area. A dike shall be constructed around this
storage area with a minimum capacity equal to 110% of the volume of all
containers in the storage area.
      (4)   Toxic or hazardous waste disposal.  Any toxic or hazardous waste
shall be disposed of properly.
      (5)   Contaminated soils disposal and runoff. Contaminated soils from
redevelopment sites shall be disposed of properly. Runoff from contaminated
soils shall not be discharged from the site. Proper permits shall be obtained
for development projects on solid waste landfill sites or redevelopment sites.
   (f)   Compliance with Other Requirements. The SWP3 shall be consistent with
applicable State and/or local waste disposal, sanitary sewer, or septic system
regulations, including provisions prohibiting waste disposal by open burning,
and shall provide for the proper disposal of contaminated soils located within
the development area.
   (g)   Trench and Ground Water Control. There shall be no sediment-laden or
turbid discharges to water resources or wetlands resulting from dewatering
activities. If trench or ground water contains sediment, it must pass through a
sediment-settling pond or other equally effective sediment control device,
prior to being discharged from the construction site. Alternatively, sediment
may be removed by settling in place or by dewatering into a sump pit, filter
bag or comparable practice. Ground water dewatering which does not contain
sediment or other pollutants is not required to be treated prior to discharge.
However, care must be taken when discharging ground water to ensure that it
does not become pollutant-laden by traversing over disturbed soils or other
pollutant sources.
   (h)   Internal Inspections. All controls on the site shall be inspected at
least once every seven calendar days and within 24 hours after any storm event
greater than one- half inch of rain per 24 hour period. The applicant shall
assign qualified inspection personnel to conduct these inspections to ensure
that the control practices are functional and to evaluate whether the SWP3 is
adequate, or whether additional control measures are required. Qualified
inspection personnel are individuals with knowledge and experience in the
installation and maintenance of sediment and erosion controls.  These
inspections shall meet the following requirements:
      (1)   Disturbed areas and areas used for storage of materials that are
exposed to precipitation shall be inspected for evidence of or the potential
for, pollutants entering the drainage system.
      (2)   Erosion and sediment control measures identified in the SWP3 shall
be observed to ensure that they are operating correctly. The applicant shall
utilize an inspection form provided by the City or an alternate form acceptable
to the City Engineer.
      (3)   Discharge locations shall be inspected to determine whether erosion
and sediment control measures are effective in preventing significant impacts
to the receiving water resource or wetlands.
      (4)   Locations where vehicles enter or exit the site shall be inspected
for evidence of off-site vehicle tracking.
      (5)   The applicant shall maintain for three years following final
stabilization the results of these inspections, the names and qualifications of
personnel making the inspections, the dates of inspections, major observations
relating to the implementation of the SWP3, a certification as to whether the
facility is in compliance with the SWP3, and information on any incidents of
noncompliance determined by these inspections.
   (i)   Maintenance.  The SWP3 shall be designed to minimize maintenance
requirements. All control practices shall be maintained and repaired as needed
to ensure continued performance of their intended function until final
stabilization. All sediment control practices must be maintained in a
functional condition until all up slope areas they control reach final
stabilization. The applicant shall provide a description of maintenance
procedures needed to ensure the continued performance of control practices and
shall ensure a responsible party and adequate funding to conduct this
maintenance, all as determined by the City Engineer. When inspections reveal
the need for repair, replacement, or installation of erosion and sediment
control BMPs, the following procedures shall be followed:
      (1)   When practices require repair or maintenance. If an internal
inspection reveals that a control practice is in need of repair or maintenance,
with the exception of a sediment settling pond, it must be repaired or
maintained within three days of the inspection. Sediment settling ponds must be
repaired or maintained within ten days of the inspection.
      (2)   When practices fail to provide their intended function. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice fails to perform its
intended function as detailed in the SWP3 and that another, more appropriate
control practice is required, the SWP3 must be amended and the new control
practice must be installed within ten days of the inspection.
      (3)   When practices depicted on the SWP3 are not installed. If an
internal inspection reveals that a control practice has not been implemented in
accordance with the schedule, the control practice must be implemented within
ten days from the date of the inspection. If the internal inspection reveals
that the planned control practice is not needed, the record must contain a
statement of explanation as to why the control practice is not needed.
   (j)   Final Stabilization. Final stabilization shall be determined by the
City Engineer.
