EDITOR'S NOTE
   The arrangement and numbering of the Codified Ordinances into component
codes, titles, chapters and sections are based on an adaptation of the decimal
numbering system which is similar to that used in the Ohio Revised Code, and in
accord with the best accepted practice in instituting a codification.  Each
section is self-identifying as to code, chapter and section number.  For
example, 305.06 indicates that the code number is 3, the chapter number is 305
(or the 5th chapter within code 3), and the section number is .06.  The code
and chapter numbers appear left of the decimal, with the code number preceding
the first two digits left of the decimal, and the chapter number being all
digits left of the decimal.  The section number appears right of the decimal. 
As another example, 113.10 indicates the code number is 1, the chapter number
is 113 (or the 13th chapter within code 1), and the section number is .10.
   This numbering system has the advantage of inherent flexibility in allowing
for an almost endless amount of expansion.  Codes, titles and chapters
initially are odd-numbered, thus reserving the use of even numbers for future
legislation.  Sections within chapters are consecutively numbered, except that
penalty provisions are usually assigned the number .99 as used in the Revised
Code.  Newly created sections subsequent to the original codification may be
indicated by three digits right of the decimal in the event the law properly
belongs between two consecutively numbered sections.  For example, newly
created 575.061, 575.062 and 575.063 follow 575.06 and precede 575.07 to be
placed in their logical position.
   Section histories enable a user to trace the origin of the law contained in
the section.  The history indicates the derivation by reference to either its
passage date and the ordinance number originally assigned to it at that time,
or to its inclusion in any prior code.  Sections without histories indicate
that the section contains new matter which was ordained by the Adopting
Ordinance which enacts the Codified Ordinances.
   The Comparative Section Table is included to show the disposition of every
ordinance included in the Codified Ordinances.  It indicates whether a given
ordinance was consolidated with another into one section or split into two or
more sections.  Cross references direct the user to subject matter reasonably
related to material contained within a given chapter.

(ORC 1.45)
      (3)   The time within which an act is required by law to be done shall be

is closed to the public for the entire day which constitutes the last day for

   (f)   Exceptions.  The rules of construction shall not apply to any law

the subject matter or context of such law may be repugnant thereto.
101.04  REVIVOR; EFFECT OF AMENDMENT OR REPEAL.
   (a)   The repeal of a repealing ordinance does not revive the ordinance
originally repealed nor impair the effect of any saving clause therein.
(ORC 1.57)
   (b)   An ordinance which is re-enacted or amended is intended to be a
continuation of the prior ordinance and not a new enactment, so far as it is
the same as the prior ordinance.
(ORC 1.54)
   (c)   The re-enactment, amendment or repeal of an ordinance does not, except
as provided in subsection (d) hereof:
      (1)   Affect the prior operation of the ordinance or any prior action
taken thereunder;
      (2)   Affect any validation, cure, right, privilege, obligation or
liability previously acquired, accrued, accorded or incurred thereunder;
      (3)   Affect any violation thereof or penalty, forfeiture or punishment
incurred in respect thereto, prior to the amendment or repeal;

enforced, and the penalty, forfeiture or punishment imposed, as if the
ordinance had not been repealed or amended.
   (d)   If the penalty, forfeiture or punishment for any offense is reduced by
a re-enactment or amendment of an ordinance, the penalty, forfeiture, or
punishment, if not already imposed, shall be imposed according to the ordinance
as amended.
(ORC 1.58)
101.05  CONSTRUCTION OF SECTION REFERENCES.

the last numbers or letters are included.
(ORC 1.56)
   (c)   Wherever in a penalty section reference is made to a violation of a
series of sections or of subsections of a section, such reference shall be
construed to mean a violation of any section or subsection included in such
reference.
   References in the Codified Ordinances to action taken or authorized under
designated sections of the Codified Ordinances include, in every case, action
taken or authorized under the applicable legislative provision which is

   (a)   If there is a conflict between figures and words in expressing a
number, the words govern.
(ORC 1.46)
   (b)   If a general provision conflicts with a special or local provision,
they shall be construed, if possible, so that effect is given to both.  If the
conflict between the provisions is irreconcilable, the special or local
provision prevails as an exception to the general provision, unless the general
provision is the later adoption and the manifest intent is that the general
provision prevail.
(ORC 1.51)
   (c)   (1)   If ordinances enacted at different meetings of Council are
irreconcilable, the ordinance latest in date of enactment prevails.
      (2)   If amendments to the same ordinance are enacted at different
meetings of Council, one amendment without reference to another, the amendments
are to be harmonized, if possible, so that effect may be given to each.  If the
amendments are substantively irreconcilable, the latest in date of enactment
prevails.  The fact that a later amendment restates language deleted by an
earlier amendment, or fails to include language inserted by an earlier
amendment, does not of itself make the amendments irreconcilable.  Amendments
are irreconcilable only when changes made by each cannot reasonably be put into
simultaneous operation.
(ORC 1.52)

   (a)   In enacting an ordinance, it is presumed that:

States is intended;
      (2)   The entire ordinance is intended to be effective;
      (3)   A just and reasonable result is intended;
      (4)   A result feasible of execution is intended.
(ORC 1.47)
   (b)   An ordinance is presumed to be prospective in its operation unless
expressly made retrospective.
(ORC 1.48)
   (c)   If an ordinance is ambiguous, the court, in determining the intention
of Council may consider among other matters:
      (1)   The object sought to be attained;
      (2)   The circumstances under which the ordinance was enacted;
      (3)   The legislative history;
      (4)   The common law or former legislative provisions, including laws
upon the same or similar subjects;
      (5)   The consequences of a particular construction;
      (6)   The administrative construction of the ordinance.
(ORC 1.49)
101.08  SEVERABILITY.
   If any provision of a section of the Codified Ordinances or the application
thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the invalidity does not
affect the other provisions or applications of the section or related sections
which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to
this end the provisions are severable.
(ORC 1.50)
101.99  GENERAL PENALTY.
   Whenever, in the Codified Ordinances or in any ordinance of the
Municipality, any act is prohibited or is made or declared to be unlawful or an
offense or a misdemeanor, or whenever the doing of any act is required or the
failure to do any act is declared to be unlawful, where no specific penalty is
otherwise provided, whoever violates any such provision shall be punished by a
fine not exceeding one hundred dollars ($100.00).  A separate offense shall be
deemed committed each day during or on which a violation continues or occurs.

   Any person may upon request and payment in advance obtain reasonable advance

107.01  PUBLIC RECORDS; DEFINITION; AVAILABILITY.
   The City of Canal Fulton, in accordance with the Ohio Revised Code, defines

   (a)   Identification Required.  Although no specific language is required to
make a request, the requester must at least identify the records requested with
sufficient clarity to allow the City to identify, retrieve, and review the
records.  If it is not clear what records are being sought, the records
custodian must contact the requester for clarification, and should assist the
requester in revising the request by informing the requester of the manner in
which the office keeps its records.
   (b)   Written Request.  A written request is not mandatory and the requester
may decline to reveal the requester's identity, or the intended use, and when a
written request or disclosure of the identity or intended use would benefit the
requester by enhancing the ability of the public office or the person
responsible for public records, to identify, locate or deliver the public
records sought by the requester.
   (c)   Inspection of Records.  Public records are to be available for
inspection during regular business hours, Monday through Friday, 8:00 a.m. to
4:00 p.m. with the exception of published holidays.  Public records must be
made available for inspection promptly.  Copies of public records must be made
available within a reasonable period of time.  "Prompt" and "reasonable" take
into account the volume of records requested; the proximity of the location
where the records are stored; and the necessity for any legal review of the
records requested.
   (d)   Time Required to Gather Records.  Each request should be evaluated for
an estimated length of time required to gather the records.  Routine requests
for records should be satisfied immediately if feasible to do so.  Routine
requests include, but are not limited to, meeting minutes (both in draft and
final form), budgets, salary information, forms and applications, personnel
rosters, etc.  If fewer than twenty pages of copies are requested or if the
records are readily available in an electronic format that can be e-mailed or
downloaded easily, these should be made as quickly as the equipment allows.  If
more copies are requested, an appointment should be made with the requester on
when the copies or computer files can be picked up.
   All requests for public records must either be satisfied or be acknowledged
in writing by the City within three business days following the office's
receipt of the request.  If a request is deemed significantly beyond "routine",
such as seeking a voluminous number of copies or requiring extensive research,
the acknowledgment must include the following:
      (1)   An estimated number of business days it will take to satisfy the
request.
      (2)   An estimated cost if copies are requested.
      (3)   Any items within the request that may be exempt from disclosure.
   (e)   Denial of Public Records.  Any denial of public records requested must
include an explanation, including legal authority.  If portions of a record are
public and portions are exempt, the exempt portions are to be redacted and the
rest released.  If there are redactions, each redaction must be accompanied by
a supporting explanation, including legal authority.
(Ord. 22-07.  Passed 9-18-07.)
107.03  COSTS FOR PUBLIC RECORDS.
   (a)   Charges.  Those seeking public records will be charged only the actual
cost of making copies.
      (1)   The charge for paper copies is five cents ($.05) per page.
      (2)   Media used, i.e., audiotapes, CD, shall be charged actual cost.
      (3)   There is no charge for documents e-mailed.
   (b)   Mailing of Documents.  Requesters may ask that documents be mailed to
them.  They will be charged the actual cost of the postage and mailing
supplies.
(Ord. 22-07.  Passed 9-18-07.)
107.04  E-MAIL.
   Documents in electronic mail format are records as defined by the Ohio
Revised Code when their content relates to the business of the office.  E-mail
is to be treated in the same fashion as records in other formats and should
follow the same retention schedules.
   (a)   Private E-Mail Accounts.  Records in private e-mail accounts used to
conduct public business are subject to disclosure, and all employees or
representatives of this office are instructed to retain their e-mails that
relate to public business (See Section
107.01) and to copy them to their business e-mail accounts and/or to the
office's records custodian.
   (b)   Retaining Private E-Mail Account Records.  The records custodian is to
treat the e-mails from private accounts as records of the public office, filing
them in the appropriate way, retaining them per established schedules and
making them available for inspection and copying in accordance with the Public
Records Act.
(Ord. 22-07.  Passed 9-18-07.)
107.05  FAILURE TO RESPOND TO A PUBLIC RECORDS REQUEST.
   The City recognizes the legal and non-legal consequences of failure to
properly respond to a public records request.  In addition to the distrust in
government that failure to comply may cause, (the public office's) failure to
comply with a request may result in a court ordering the City to comply with
the law and to pay the requester attorney's fees and damages.
(Ord. 22-07.  Passed 9-18-07.)
107.06  PUBLIC RECORDS REPRESENTATIVE.
   The Clerk of Council is hereby designated Public Records Representative for
the Mayor and Council.

CHAPTER 108
Anti-Retaliation Policy
108.01   Introduction and purpose.
108.02   Encouragement of reporting.
108.03   Protection from retaliation.
108.04   Contents of report; where to report and investigation.
108.01  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.
   This anti-retaliation policy of the City:
   (a)   Encourages employees to come forward with credible information on
prohibited practices or violations of law;
   (b)   Specifies that the City will protect the person from retaliation; and
   (c)   Identifies where such information can be reported.
(Res. 31-11.  Passed 12-20-11.)
108.02  ENCOURAGEMENT OF REPORTING.
   (a)   The City encourages complaints, reports or inquiries about prohibited
practices or violations of law, including illegal or improper conduct by the
City itself, by its leadership, or by others on its behalf. For purposes of
this policy, "violations of law" means a violation of any state, federal or
local law that the city has the authority to correct and the reporting employee
reasonably believes to be:
      (1)   A criminal offense that is likely to cause an imminent risk of
physical harm to persons,
      (2)   A hazard to public health or safety, or
      (3)   A felony.
   (b)   For purposes of this policy, "prohibited practices" means conduct that
a reporting employee reasonably believes to be a serious violation of the
policies and practices established by the City and that would financially or
detrimentally impact the City, such as in correct financial reporting,
financial improprieties, accounting or audit matters, or detrimentally impact
the reputation of the City, such as ethical violations, fraudulent conduct, or
other similar improper practices.
(Res. 31-11.  Passed 12-20-11.)
108.03  PROTECTION FROM RETALIATION.
   (a)   The City prohibits retaliation by or on behalf of the City against
employees for making good faith complaints, reports or inquiries under this
policy or for participating in a review or investigation under this policy.
This includes, but is not limited to, retaliation in the form of an adverse
employment action such as termination, decrease in compensation, the threat of
physical harm or co-worker threats, harassment, and/or intimidation. Every
effort will be made to protect the confidentiality of the employee making the
report. However, a reporting individual's identity may have to be disclosed to
conduct a thorough investigation, to comply with the law, and to provide
accused individuals their legal rights of defense.
   (b)   This protection extends to those whose allegations are made in good
faith but prove to be mistaken. The City reserves the right to discipline
persons who make bad faith, knowingly false, or vexatious complaints, reports
or inquiries or who otherwise abuse this policy. The employee is subject to
disciplinary action, including suspension or removal, as determined by the
employee's appointing authority (if the accused is the mayor the appointing
authority is the Council) for purposely, knowingly, or recklessly reporting
false information under this policy. Any staff member or volunteer who makes a
report under this policy who believes he or she is being retaliated against
must immediately contact the Director of Law. If the Director of Law is
implicated in the complaint, report or inquiry, it should be directed to any
member of City Council, the Mayor, or City Manager not so implicated.
(Res. 31-11.  Passed 12-20-11.)
108.04  CONTENTS OF REPORT; WHERE TO REPORT AND INVESTIGATION.
   Subject to disclosure that may be necessary as described in Section 108.03
above, complaints, reports or inquiries may be made under this policy on a
confidential basis. They should describe in detail the specific facts
demonstrating the basis for the complaints, reports or inquiries. They should
be directed to the Director of Law (who may utilize the City’s designated
Prosecutorial Service). If the Director of Law is implicated in the complaint,
report or inquiry, it should be directed to the Mayor, City Manager, or any
member of City Council not so implicated. The City will conduct a prompt,
discreet, and objective review or investigation. Employees must recognize that
the City may be unable to fully evaluate a vague or general complaint, report
or inquiry.
(Res. 31-11.  Passed 12-20-11.)

collection agency and have been deemed uncollectible by said collection agency
shall be written off by the City.
   (e)   There will be no charge for emergency medical transports of Medicaid
patients from nursing homes.
(Res. 17-10.  Passed 6-15-10; Res. 26-10.  Passed 8-3-10.)
110.04  BILLING/COLLECTION ADMINISTRATION.
   (a)   If the person charged does not have private or public medical
insurance and is financially unable to pay; payment options are available to
those who qualify. The person shall submit the first page of the previous
year's Federal tax return to demonstrate their eligibility for any reduction of
the bill. Hardship will be determined upon Federal poverty guidelines. Any

hardship deduction, they will have the following options available:
         A.   Twenty-five percent discount if bill is paid by cash or check
within 30 days.
         B.   Ten percent discount with the balance equally divided over 12
months.
      (2)   If a person fails to make the required amount of payment, and the
account is referred for further collections, the discount will be reversed and
the patient will be responsible for the full amount of the bill.
   (c)   An account with more than fifty dollars ($50.00) owing shall be sent
to collection if no response has been received requesting insurance information
or patient has not contacted the Billing Specialist to make payment
arrangements within 90 days of the request. The Ambulance Billing Specialist
will provide to the Finance Director a list of potential accounts that are
ready to go to collection. The Finance Director will review and authorize the
sending of said accounts to collection.
   (d)   Some insurance companies may submit payment to the patient or
financially responsible party directly when it should be sent to the City. If
this occurs and the patient or financially responsible party has not forwarded
the check, they will receive a letter requesting reimbursement. This applies to
residents and nonresidents alike.
   (e)   All bankruptcy filings will be sent to the Finance Director with a
copy to the Law Director.
   (f)   Claims will be filed with automobile insurance carriers. However,
patients must resolve litigation matters (i.e., auto accidents) outside of this
billing process as such legal action may take years to settle. The patient is
responsible for payment of the invoice if the carrier has not paid the claim
within 90 days of the filing date.

141.15  PROMOTION, LAYOFF AND CAREER DEVELOPMENT.
   (a)   All vacancies occurring within the work force shall, whenever

(Ord. 6-99.  Passed 2-16-99.)
141.16  DISCIPLINE.
   (a)    Discipline procedures exist to prevent or correct situations which
may jeopardize the employee's welfare and the welfare of other employees or the
City through incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, bribery, drunkenness,
immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the public, neglect
of duty, or any other act of misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance in the
performance of duty, or misconduct. The following indicates the City's approach
toward discipline:
      (1)    Warnings.  Warnings may be oral or written. The objective of the
initial contact with any employee who has apparently violated a rule or
regulation, or in some way engaged in unacceptable conduct, is to gather all
the facts relevant to the situation prior to making a judgment. If a rule or
regulation has been violated, an oral warning is normally sufficient for the
first offense, unless the seriousness of the case demands stronger action. A
written warning normally will be given for a repeated violation.
      (2)    Suspensions. If an employee repeatedly engages in a rule or
regulation violation, or if the nature of such violation is serious, the
employee will be suspended without pay for a period of time commensurate with
the offense. Such suspension may be progressively longer if repeated unless
discharge is warranted.
      (3)    Discharge for cause. When an employee's action is of a very
serious nature the above procedure may be disregarded and immediate dismissal
instituted. If an employee is asked to leave, the employee will receive his
final pay according to the scheduled normal pay plan period as defined
elsewhere in this chapter.
   (b)    When the Mayor has reason to believe that a member of the police
service has been guilty of incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, bribery,
drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the
public, neglect of duty, or any other act of misfeasance, malfeasance or
nonfeasance in the performance of duty, he shall take such action as is
required, and the hearing and disposition of such charges shall be made as
provided in Ohio R.C. 737.171.
   (c)    When the Mayor has reason to believe that a member of the fire
service has been guilty of incompetency, inefficiency, dishonesty, bribery,
drunkenness, immoral conduct, insubordination, discourteous treatment of the
public, neglect of duty or any other act of misfeasance, malfeasance or
nonfeasance in the performance of duty, he shall take such action as is
required, and the hearing and disposition of such charges shall be made as
provided in Ohio R.C. 733.35 through 733.39.
   (d)    Employees other than those covered by subsections (b) and (c) hereof,
may be removed at any regular meeting of Council. At such meeting, the employee
subject to removal shall have the right to be heard in person or by counsel,
and to present evidence and to examine and cross examine any witness. Removal
of employees under this subsection shall be without cause and at the discretion
of Council.
(Ord. 19-85. Passed 9-3-85.)
141.17  GRIEVANCE PROCEDURE.
   Any regular employee of the City may invoke the grievance procedures, as
established by this section to seek redress for alleged wrongs relating to
conditions of work, administration of this chapter or other job related
concerns.
   (a)    The employee shall verbally inform his department head of the nature
and details of the grievance. The department head shall, within three days,
counsel the employee in a private manner which will not embarrass the employee.
Every effort will be made to settle the grievance in a manner satisfactory to
both parties.
   (b)    If the grievance is not settled according to the procedure set forth
in subsection (a) hereof, or if the employee has no immediate department head
other than the appointing authority, the employee shall in writing inform the
appointing authority of the nature and details of the grievance. The appointing
authority shall, within three working days counsel the employee in a private
manner which will not embarrass the employee. Every effort will be made to
settle the grievance in a manner satisfactory to both parties.
   (c)    If the grievance remains unsettled, the employee shall file a written
description of the nature and details of the grievance with the appointing
authority and with the Clerk of Council. The appointing authority shall, within
five working days after receiving the written grievance, provide a written
reply to the employee, and a copy shall be filed with the Clerk of Council.
Such written reply shall specify the findings and conclusions of the appointing
authority.
   (d)    If the grievance remains unsettled, the employee may refer the
grievance in writing to Council for determination. Upon notification by the
employee, the Clerk of Council shall submit copies of all written material
filed with the Clerk of Council according to subsection (c) hereof, to the
members of Council. Council, or a committee of Council, shall hear and consider
the grievance within thirty days after receiving the written material. The
decision of Council shall be final.

      (3)   An employee returning to work after any absence due to sickness or
injury may be required to have a medical statement from his doctor explaining

Department, Parks Department, Sewer/Water Department, and in their absence,
their, respective supervisors who are next in the chain of command.  For the

the use or sale of controlled substances while on duty.
   (e)   Employees in positions outlined in Section

      (2)   On the portion of the distributive share of the net profits earned

on and after January 1, 1984, or a resident partner or owner of a nonresident
unincorporated business entity not attributable to the Municipality and not
levied against such unincorporated business entity by the Municipality. 
However, effective for tax years 2004 and later, the distributive share of
income paid to an S corporation shareholder shall be taxable in the following
manner:

taxable only to the extent that it represents wages or net earnings from self-
employment.

income was derived from a business activity of such taxpayer and the net income
from such royalty interest shall be subject to tax.
      (2)   Finance carrying charges.  The employer's income derived from
finance and carrying charges associated with their consumer's accounts
receivable.
   (g)   In determining income subject to taxation, losses from the operation

other non-business income.

credit against the tax imposed by this chapter of the amount so paid by him or
her or on his or her behalf to such other municipality or Joint Economic
Development District.  The credit shall be 50% of the tax assessed by this
chapter on such income earned in such other municipality or Joint Economic
Development District where such tax is paid.  This subsection shall be
effective January 1, 2002.  (See Section
181.33)

(Ord. 37-03.  Passed 12-16-03; Res. 13-07.  Passed 7-17-07.)
181.04  EFFECTIVE PERIOD.
   The tax shall be levied, collected and paid with respect to income,
qualifying wages, commissions and other compensation, and with respect to the
net profits of businesses, professions or other activities earned on and after

(Ord. 37-03.  Passed 12-16-03.)
181.05  DETERMINATION OF ALLOCATION OF TAX.
   Net profit from a business or profession conducted both within and without
the boundaries of the Municipality shall be considered as having a taxable
situs in the City for purposes of this tax in the same proportion as the
average ratio of:
   (a)   The average original cost of the real and tangible personal property
owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession in the Municipality
during the taxable period to the average original cost of all the real and
tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or
profession during the same period, wherever situated.  Real property shall
include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value of such
property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon by eight.
   (b)   Wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the taxable period
the persons employed in the business or profession for services performed in
the Municipality to wages, salaries and other compensation paid during the same
period to persons employed in the business or profession wherever their
services are performed.  Wages, salaries, and other compensation shall be
included to the extent that they represent qualifying wages.
   (c)   Gross receipts of the business or profession from sales made and
services performed during the taxable period in the Municipality to gross
receipts of the business or profession during the same period from sales and
services wherever made or performed.
   In the event that the foregoing apportionment formula does not produce an
equitable result, another basis may, under uniform regulations, be substituted
so as to produce such result.
(Ord. 37-03.  Passed 12-16-03.)
181.06  SALES MADE IN THE MUNICIPALITY.
   As used in Section
181.05(c), "sales made in the Municipality" means:
   (a)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes if shipped or delivered from
stock of goods within the Municipality.
   (b)   All sales of tangible personal property which is delivered within the
Municipality regardless of where title passes even though transported from a
point outside the Municipality if the taxpayer is regularly engaged through his
own employees in the solicitation or promotion of sales within the Municipality
and the sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
   (c)   All sales of tangible personal property which is shipped from a place
within the Municipality to purchasers outside the Municipality regardless of
where title passes if the taxpayer is not, through his own employees, regularly
engaged in the solicitation or promotion of sales at the place where delivery
is made.
(Ord. 37-03.  Passed 12-16-03.)
181.07  TOTAL ALLOCATION.
   Add together the percentages determined in accordance with subsections (a),
(b) and (c) of Section
181.05 or such of the aforesaid percentages as are applicable to the particular
taxpayer and divide the total so obtained by the number of percentages used in
deriving the total in order to obtain the business apportionment percentage
referred to in Section
181.05.
   A factor is applicable even though it may be allocable entirely in or
outside the Municipality.
(Ord. 37-03.  Passed 12-16-03.)
181.08  RENTALS.
   (a)   (1)   Rental income received by a taxpayer shall be included in the
computation of net profits from business activities under subsections (c), (d)
and (e) of Section
181.03, only if and to the extent that the rental, ownership, management or
operations of the real estate from which such rentals are derived (whether so
rented, managed or operated by a taxpayer, individually or through agents or
other representatives) constitutes a business activity of the taxpayer in whole
or in part.
      (2)   Rental losses on properties can offset rental net profits of other
rental properties, but not net profits of non-rental businesses.  In the case
of non-residents of the Municipality, only those rental properties within the
municipality shall be considered when computing loss or net profit on rentals
for this municipality.
   (b)   Where the gross monthly rental of any and all real properties
regardless of number and value, aggregates in excess of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00) per month, it shall be prima- facie evidence that the rental,
ownership, management or operation of such properties is a business activity of
such taxpayer and the net income of such rental property shall be subject to
tax.
      (1)   In the case of commercial property, the owner shall be considered
engaged in a business activity when the rental is based on a fixed or
fluctuating percentage of gross or net sales, receipts or profits of the
lessee, whether or not such rental exceeds two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00)

181.16  PAYMENT OF TAX ON FILING OF RETURN.
   (a)   The taxpayer making a return shall, at the time of filing thereof, pay

shall deduct, at the time of the payment of salary, qualifying wages,

181.03 per year of the qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation or
other income due by the employer to the employee, and shall, on or before the
fifteenth day of each month, make a return and pay to the Administrator the
amount of taxes so deducted during the previous month.  However, if the taxes
withheld by an employer for the Municipality during the previous tax year
averaged less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) per month, payments may be
made quarterly on or before the last day of the month following the end of each
quarter, subject to the approval of the Administrator.
      (2)   When a resident or non-resident receives compensation for services
for sales of real estate or insurance from an employer whose situs is the City
of Canal Fulton, that total compensation is taxable at Canal Fulton tax rate
and is payable to the City of Canal Fulton.  The site of the property sold or
residence of the purchaser of insurance has no bearing on the taxing of the
compensation, and therefore income tax shall be deducted and remitted in
accordance with
181.17(a)(1).
   (b)   Returns shall be on a form or forms prescribed or acceptable to the
Administrator and shall be subject to the rules and regulations prescribed
therefor by the Administrator.  The employer shall be liable for the payment of
the tax required to be deducted and withheld whether or not such taxes have, in
fact, been withheld.
   (c)   Such employer in collecting such tax shall be deemed to hold the same,
until payment is made by such employer to the Municipality, as a trustee for
the benefit of the Municipality, and any such tax collected by such employer
from his employees, shall, until the same is paid to the Municipality, be
deemed a trust fund in the hands of such employer.
   (d)   No person shall be required to withhold the tax on wages or other
compensation paid domestic servants employed by him exclusively in or about
such person's residence, even though such residence is in the Municipality but
such employee shall be subject to all the requirements of this chapter.
   (e)   (1)   Every manager is deemed to be a trustee of this Municipality in
collecting and holding the tax required under this chapter to be withheld, and
the funds so collected by such withholding are deemed to be trust funds.
      (2)   Every manager is liable directly to this Municipality for payment
of such trust, whether actually collected by such employer or not.
      (3)   All managers shall be personally liable to the extent of the tax,
interest and penalty, jointly and severally, for failure to file the employer's
return or to pay the employer's tax, interest and penalty as required under
this chapter.
      (4)   No change in structure by an employer, including a fundamental
change, discharges its managers from liability for the employees' or manager's
failure to remit funds held in trust, to file a tax return or to pay taxes.
   (f)   All employers that provide any contractual service within the
Municipality, and who employ subcontractors in conjunction with that service,
shall provide the Municipality the names and addresses of the subcontractors. 
The subcontractors shall be responsible for all income tax withholding
requirements under this chapter.

a declaration, on any resident taxpayer who was not domiciled in the
municipality on the first day of January in the year in which they became

regarding refunds of tax withheld from non-qualified deferred compensation
plans (NDCP):
      (1)   A taxpayer may be eligible for a refund if the taxpayer has
suffered a loss from a NDCP.  The loss will be considered sustained only in the
taxable year in which the taxpayer receives the final distribution of money and
property pursuant to the NDCP.  Full loss is sustained if no distribution of
money and property will be made by the NDCP.
      (2)   A taxpayer who receives income as a result of payments from a NDCP,
and that income is less than the amount of income deferred to the NDCP and upon

income received from the NDCP.  If different tax rates applies to the tax years
in which deferrals, a weighted average of the different tax rates will be used
to compute the refund amount.
      (3)   Refunds shall be allowed only if the loss is attributable to the
bankruptcy of the employer who had established the NDCP, or the employee's
failure or inability to satisfy all of the employer's terms and conditions
necessary to receive the nonqualified compensation.
   (b)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City of Canal Fulton, but
should have been deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City
of Canal Fulton as a refund but is subject to the three-year limitation on
refunds.  Income tax that should have been deposited with the City of Canal
Fulton, but was deposited with another municipality, shall be subject to
recovery by the City of Canal Fulton.  The City of Canal Fulton will allow a

excess of the amount to be refunded by the other municipality, as long as the
tax rate of the other municipality is the same or higher than the City of Canal
Fulton's tax rate.  If the City of Canal Fulton's tax rate is higher, the tax
representing the net difference of the rates is also subject to collection by
the City of Canal Fulton.

   Every individual taxpayer who resides in the Municipality, who receives net

for work done or services performed or rendered in another municipality or
unincorporated area comprising a Joint Economic Development District on such
net profits, qualifying wages, commissions or other compensation or other
income shall be allowed a credit on the tax imposed by this chapter on the
amount paid to such other municipality or Joint Economic Development District;
provided, however, such credit shall only be allowable to the extent such tax
is paid to another municipality or Joint Economic Development District on the
income subject to the tax imposed by the chapter; and provided further that no
credit shall be allowed for any overpayment of tax to another municipality or
Joint Economic Development District.  The credit shall not exceed the tax

chapter shall be paid.
   (b)   In any and all actions whereby the City of Canal Fulton grants

taxation from the City of Canal Fulton shall provide the administration and

from normal operations of the business or industry within the corporate limits
of Canal Fulton while the exemption from real property taxation is in effect.
      (3)   New business or industry.  Actual annual Canal Fulton City income
tax receipts from each and every year that an exemption from real property
taxation remains in effect will be used to determine the actual amount of
compensation paid to the Northwest Local School District by the City of Canal
Fulton for real property taxes that would have been received by the School
District.
         A.   If the actual income tax received by the City is greater than the
annual property tax revenue that would have been realized by the Northwest

amount of revenue that would have been realized from the property tax
assessment.  This payment shall be made to the Northwest Local School District

than the annual property tax that would have been realized by the Northwest
Local School District (the amount as determined by the Stark County Auditor)

half of the actual income tax received from the business or industry.  This
payment shall be made to the Northwest Local School District in its entirety
within thirty days of receipt of payment by the City of Canal Fulton of the
final City Income Tax amount(s) owned by the business or industry for the prior
year.
      (4)   Existing business or industry.  In the case of property tax
abatements granted to existing businesses or industries which are expanding,
tax sharing shall apply only to additional income tax revenues yielded by the
development.  Additional income taxes shall be calculated by subtracting the
amount of income taxes collected in the year prior to the abatement (base year)
from the income tax collections during each year of the abatement (abatement
year 1, 2, 3, etc.)
         A.   If the actual additional income tax received by the City is
greater than the annual additional property tax revenue that would have been
realized by the Northwest Local School District (the amount as determined by
the Stark County Auditor) the City of Canal Fulton will pay to the Northwest
Local School District the actual amount of revenue that would have been
realized from the additional property tax assessment.  This payment shall be
made to the Northwest Local School District in its entirety within thirty days
of receipt of payment by the City of Canal Fulton, Ohio of the final City
Income Tax amount(s) owed by the business or industry for the prior year.

from the business entity.  This payment shall be made to the Northwest Local
School District in its entirety within thirty days of receipt of payment by the

business or industry for the prior year.

Municipal operations, or in such other fund or funds as Council may from time
to time establish or designate.

   (a)   For residents of the City the income tax levied herein shall be on all
income, salaries, qualifying wages, commissions, and other compensation from
whatever source earned and/or received by the resident, including the
resident's distributive share of the net profit of pass-through entities owned
directly or indirectly by the resident and any net profit of the resident. This
is further detailed in the definition of income (Section
182.02(c)(16)).

and other compensation from whatever source earned or received by the
nonresident for work done, services performed or rendered, or activities
conducted in the municipal corporation, including any net profit of the
nonresident, but excluding the nonresident's distributive share of the net
profit or loss of only pass-through entities owned directly or indirectly by
the nonresident.
   (c)   For residents and nonresidents subject to the City’s income tax of one
and one-half percent, income can be reduced to Municipal taxable income as

         A.   "Nonqualified deferred compensation plan" means a compensation
plan described in section 3121(v)(2)(C) of the Internal Revenue Code.
         B.   "Qualifying loss" means the amount of compensation attributable

receives the final distribution of money and property pursuant to that
nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         C.   1.   "Qualifying tax rate" means the applicable tax rate for the
taxable year for the which the taxpayer paid income tax to the City with
respect to any portion of the total amount of compensation the payment of which
is deferred pursuant to a nonqualified deferred compensation plan.

then the qualifying tax rate is a weighted average of those different tax
rates. The weighted average shall be based upon the tax paid to the City each
year with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation plan.
         D.   "Refundable credit" means the amount of the City income tax that
was paid on the non-distributed portion, if any, of a nonqualified deferred
compensation plan.

plan, the amount of the credit that a taxpayer may claim from each municipal
corporation shall be calculated on the basis of each municipal corporation's
proportionate share of the total municipal corporation income tax paid by the
taxpayer to all municipal corporations with respect to the nonqualified
deferred compensation plan.
      (3)   In no case shall the amount of the credit allowed under this
section exceed the cumulative income tax that a taxpayer has paid to the City
for all taxable years with respect to the nonqualified deferred compensation
plan.
      (4)   The credit allowed under this division is allowed only to the
extent the taxpayer's qualifying loss is attributable to:

employer's terms and conditions necessary to receive the nonqualified deferred
compensation.

         H.   The location of educational institutions attended by the
individual's dependents as defined in section 152 of the Internal Revenue Code,
to the extent that tuition paid to such educational institution is based on the
residency of the individual or the individual's spouse in the municipal
corporation where the educational institution is located;
         I.   The number of contact periods the individual has with the City.
For the purposes of this division, an individual has one contact period with

      (3)   All additional applicable factors are provided in the Rules and
Regulations.

average ratio of the following:

personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the business or profession
in the City during the taxable period to the average original cost of all of
the real and tangible personal property owned or used by the taxpayer in the
business or profession during the same period, wherever situated.
               As used in the preceding paragraph, tangible personal or real
property shall include property rented or leased by the taxpayer and the value
of such property shall be determined by multiplying the annual rental thereon
by eight;
         B.   Wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during the taxable
period to individuals employed in the business or profession for services
performed in the City to wages, salaries, and other compensation paid during
the same period to individuals employed in the business or profession, wherever

taxes are not required to be withheld under Section
182.04(c);
         C.   Total gross receipts of the business or profession from sales and
rentals made and services performed during the taxable period in the City to
total gross receipts of the business or profession during the same period from
sales, rentals, and services, wherever made or performed.
      (2)   A.   If the apportionment factors described in division (f)(1) of
this section do not fairly represent the extent of a taxpayer's business
activity in the City, the taxpayer may request, or the Tax Administrator of the
City may require, that the taxpayer use, with respect to all or any portion of
the income of the taxpayer, an alternative apportionment method involving one
or more of the following:
            1.   Separate accounting;
            2.   The exclusion of one or more of the factors;
            3.   The inclusion of one or more additional factors that would
provide for a more fair apportionment of the income of the taxpayer to the
municipal corporation;
            4.   A modification of one or more of the factors.
         B.   A taxpayer request to use an alternative apportionment method
shall be in writing and shall accompany a tax return, timely filed appeal of an
assessment, or timely filed amended tax return. The taxpayer may use the
requested alternative method unless the Tax Administrator denies the request in
an assessment issued within the period prescribed by Section
182.12(a).
         C.   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer to use an
alternative apportionment method as described in division (f)(2)A. of this
section, but only by issuing an assessment to the taxpayer within the period
prescribed by Section
182.12(a).
         D.   Nothing in division (f)(2) of this section nullifies or otherwise
affects any alternative apportionment arrangement approved by the Tax
Administrator or otherwise agreed upon by both the Tax Administrator and
taxpayer before January 1, 2016.
      (3)   As used in division (f)(1)B. of this section, wages, salaries, and
other compensation includes only wages, salaries, or other compensation paid to
an employee for services performed at any of the following locations:

inquiry, review, court-martial, or similar administrative, judicial, or
legislative matter or proceeding is being conducted, provided that the
compensation is paid for services performed for, or on behalf of, the employer
or that the employee's presence at the location directly or indirectly benefits
the employer.
         C.   Any other location, if the Tax Administrator determines that the
employer directed the employee to perform the services at the other location in
lieu of a location described in division (f)(3)A. or B. of this section solely
in order to avoid or reduce the employer's Municipal income tax liability. If
the Tax Administrator makes such a determination, the employer may dispute the
determination by establishing, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the Tax
Administrator's determination was unreasonable.

sales and rentals made and services performed shall be sitused to a municipal
corporation as follows:
         A.   1.   For tax years prior to the taxable year beginning January
1,2018, gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property shall be

               a.   The property is shipped to or delivered within the City
from a stock of goods located within the City.
               b.   The property is delivered within the City from a location

sales result from such solicitation or promotion.
      (5)   The net profit received by an individual taxpayer from the rental
of real estate owned directly by the individual, or by a disregarded entity
owned by the individual, shall be subject to the City’s tax only if the
property generating the net profit is located in the City or if the individual
taxpayer that receives the net profit is a resident of the City. The City shall

calculating net profit sitused under this division to the municipal corporation
in which the property is located.
      (6)   A.   Commissions received by a real estate agent or broker relating
to the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate shall be sitused to the

to the commissions received from the sale, purchase, or lease of real estate
everywhere in the taxable year.
         B.   An individual who is a resident of the City shall report the
individual's net profit from all real estate activity on the individual's
annual tax return for the City.  The individual may claim a credit for taxes

Withholding Provisions.
   (a)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer located or doing
business in the City shall withhold an income tax from the qualifying wages
earned and/or received by each employee in the City.  Except for qualifying
wages for which withholding is not required under Section
182.03 or division (b)(4) or (b)(6) of this section, the tax shall be withheld
at the rate, specified in Section
182.03, of one and one-half percent.  An employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer shall deduct and withhold the tax from qualifying wages on the date
that the employer, agent, or other payer directly, indirectly, or
constructively pays the qualifying wages to, or credits the qualifying wages to
the benefit of, the employee.
   (b)   (1)   Except as provided in division (b)(2) of this section, an
employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall remit to the Tax
Administrator of the City the greater of the income taxes deducted and withheld
or the income taxes required to be deducted and withheld by the employer,
agent, or other payer according to the following schedule:
         A.   Taxes required to be deducted and withheld shall be remitted
monthly to the Tax Administrator if the total taxes deducted and withheld or
required to be deducted and withheld by the employer, agent, or other payer on
behalf of the City in the preceding calendar year exceeded two thousand three
hundred ninety-nine dollars ($2,399), or if the total amount of taxes deducted
and withheld or required to be deducted and withheld on behalf of the City in
any month of the preceding calendar quarter exceeded two hundred dollars
($200.00).
               Payment under division (b)(1)A. of this section shall be made to
the Tax Administrator not later than fifteen days after the last day of each
month for which the tax was withheld.
         B.   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer not required
to make payments under division (b)(1)A. of this section of taxes required to
be deducted and withheld shall make quarterly payments to the Tax Administrator
not later than the last day of the month following the last day  of each
calendar quarter.
      (2)   If the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is required
to make payments electronically for the purpose of paying Federal taxes
withheld on payments to employees under section 6302 of the Internal Revenue
Code, 26 C.F.R. 31.6302-1, or any other Federal statute or regulation, the
payment and subsequent payments, based on the Tax Administrator's
determination, may be required to be made by electronic funds transfer to the
Tax Administrator of all taxes deducted and withheld on behalf of the City. 
The payment of tax by electronic funds transfer under this division does not
affect an employer's, agent's, or other payer's obligation to file any return
as required under this section.
      (3)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer shall make and
file a return showing the amount of tax withheld by the employer, agent, or
other payer from the qualifying wages of each employee and remitted to the Tax
Administrator. A return filed by an employer, agent, or other payer under this
division shall be accepted by the Tax Administrator as the return required of
an non-resident employee whose sole income subject to the tax under this
chapter is the qualifying wages reported by the employee's employer, agent of
an employer, or other payer.
      (4)   An employer, agent of an employer, or other payer is not required
to withhold the City income tax with respect to an individual's disqualifying
disposition of an incentive stock option if, at the time of the disqualifying
disposition, the individual is not an employee of either the corporation with
respect to whose stock the option has been issued or of such corporation's
successor entity.
      (5)   A.   An employee is not relieved from liability for a tax by the
failure of the employer, agent of an employer, or other payer to withhold the
tax as required under this chapter or by the employer's, agent's, or other
payer's exemption from the requirement to withhold the tax.
         B.   The failure of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer
to remit to the City the tax withheld relieves the employee from liability for
that tax unless the employee colluded with the employer, agent, or other payer
in connection with the failure to remit the tax withheld.
      (6)   Compensation deferred before June 26, 2003, is not subject to the
City income tax or income tax withholding requirement to the extent the
deferred compensation does not constitute qualifying wages at the time the
deferred compensation is paid or distributed.
      (7)   Each employer, agent of an employer, or other payer required to
withhold taxes is liable for the payment of that amount required to be
withheld, whether or not such taxes have been withheld, and such amount shall
be deemed to be held in trust for the City until such time as the withheld
amount is remitted to the Tax Administrator.
      (8)   On or before the last day of February of each year, an employer
shall file a withholding reconciliation return with the Tax Administrator
listing:
         A.   The names, addresses, and Social Security numbers of all
employees from whose qualifying wages tax was withheld or should have been
withheld for the City during the preceding calendar year;
         B.   The amount of tax withheld, if any, from each such employee, the
total amount of qualifying wages paid to such employee during the preceding
calendar year;

withheld or should have been withheld from such employee during the preceding
calendar year;
         D.   Any other information required for Federal income tax reporting

      (9)   The officer or the employee of the employer, agent of an employer,
or other payer with control or direct supervision of or charged with the
responsibility for withholding the tax or filing the reports and making
payments as required by this section, shall be personally liable for a failure
to file a report or pay the tax due as required by this section. The
dissolution of an employer, agent of an employer, or other payer does not
discharge the officer's or employee's liability for a failure of the employer,
agent of an employer, or other payer to file returns or pay any tax due.
      (10)   An employer is required to deduct and withhold City income tax on
tips and gratuities received by the employer's employees and constituting
qualifying wages, but only to the extent that the tips and gratuities are under
the employer's control. For the purposes of this division, a tip or gratuity is
under the employer's control if the tip or gratuity is paid by the customer to
the employer for subsequent remittance to the employee, or if the customer pays
the tip or gratuity by credit card, debit card, or other electronic means.
      (11)   The Tax Administrator shall consider any tax withheld by an
employer at the request of an employee, when such tax is not otherwise required
to be withheld by this chapter, to be tax required to be withheld and remitted
for the purposes of this section.

employee spent the greatest number of days in a calendar year performing
services for or on behalf of the employer, but instead there are two or more
municipal corporations in which the employee spent an identical number of days
that is greater than the number of days the employee spent in any other
municipal corporation, the employer shall allocate any of the employee's
qualifying wages subject to division (c)(2)A.1. of this section among those two
or more municipal corporations. The allocation shall be made using any fair and
reasonable method, including, but not limited to, an equal allocation among
such municipal corporations or an allocation based upon the time spent or sales
made by the employee in each such municipal corporation. A municipal
corporation to which qualifying wages are allocated under this division shall
be the employee's principal place of work with respect to those qualifying
wages for the purposes of this section.
               For the purposes of this division, the location at which an
employee spends a particular day shall be determined in accordance with

this section, an employer is not required to withhold City income tax on
qualifying wages paid to an employee for the performance of personal services
in the City if the employee performed such services in the City on twenty or
fewer days in a calendar year, unless one of the following conditions applies:
            1.   The employee's principal place of work is located in the City.
            2.   The employee performed services at one or more presumed
worksite locations in the City. For the purposes of this division, "presumed
worksite location" means a construction site or other temporary worksite in the
City at which the employer provides or provided services that can reasonably
be, or would have been, expected by the employer to last more than twenty days
in a calendar year. Services can reasonably be expected by the employer to last
more than twenty days if either of the following applies at the time the
services commence:
               a.   The nature of the services are such that it will require
more than twenty days of the services to complete the services;
               b.   The agreement between the employer and its customer to

performance of services in the employee's capacity as a professional athlete,
professional entertainer, or public figure.
         B.   For the purposes of division (c)(2)A. of this section, an
employee shall be considered to have spent a day performing services in the
City only if the employee spent more time performing services for or on behalf
of the employer in the City than in any other municipal corporation on that
day. For the purposes of determining the amount of time an employee spent in a
particular location, the time spent performing one or more of the following
activities shall be considered to have been spent at the employee's principal
place of work:
            1.   Traveling to the location at which the employee will first
perform services for the employer for the day;
            2.   Traveling from a location at which the employee was performing
services for the employer to any other location;
            3.   Traveling from any location to another location in order to

processed, remanufactured, or improved by the employee's employer;
            4.   Transporting or delivering property described in division (c)
(2)B.3. of this section, provided that, upon delivery of the property, the

owned, used, or controlled by a person other than the employee's employer;
            5.   Traveling from the location at which the employee makes the
employee's final delivery or pick-up for the day to either the employee's
principal place of work or a location at which the employee will not perform
services for the employer.
      (3)   If the principal place of work of an employee is located in another
Ohio municipal corporation that imposes an income tax, the exception from
withholding requirements described in division (c)(2)A. of this section shall
apply only if, with respect to the employee's qualifying wages described in
that division, the employer withholds and remits tax on such qualifying wages
to that municipal corporation.
      (4)   A.   Except as provided in division (c)(4)B. of this section, if,
during a calendar year, the number of days an employee spends performing

shall withhold and remit tax to the City for any subsequent days in that
calendar year on which the employer pays qualifying wages to the employee for
personal services performed in the City.
         B.   An employer required to begin withholding tax for the City under
division (c)(4)A. of this section may elect to withhold tax for the City for
the first twenty days on which the employer paid qualifying wages to the
employee for personal services performed in the City.
      (5)   If an employer's fixed location is the City and the employer
qualifies as a small employer as defined in Section
182.02, the employer shall withhold Municipal income tax on all of the
employee's qualifying wages for a taxable year and remit that tax only to the
City, regardless of the number of days which the employee worked outside the
corporate boundaries of the City.
            To determine whether an employer qualifies as a small employer for
a taxable year, the employer will be required to provide the Tax Administrator
with the employer's Federal income tax return for the preceding taxable year.
      (6)   Divisions (c)(2)A. and (c)(4) of this section shall not apply to
the extent that the Tax Administrator and an employer enter into an agreement

182.05  ANNUAL RETURN; FILING.
   (a)   An annual City income tax return shall be completed and filed by every
individual taxpayer eighteen years of age or older and any taxpayer that is not
an individual for each taxable year for which the taxpayer is subject to the
tax, whether or not a tax is due thereon.
      (1)   The Tax Administrator may accept on behalf of all nonresident
individual taxpayers a return filed by an employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer under Section
182.04 when the nonresident individual taxpayer's sole income subject to the
tax is the qualifying wages reported by the employer, agent of an employer, or
other payer, and no additional tax is due the City.
      (2)   Retirees having no Municipal taxable income for the City income tax
purposes may file with the Tax Administrator a written exemption from these
filing requirements on a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator. The written
exemption shall indicate the date of retirement and the entity from which
retired. The exemption shall be in effect until such time as the retiree
receives Municipal taxable income taxable to the City, at which time the
retiree shall be required to comply with all applicable provisions of this
chapter.
   (b)   If an individual is deceased, any return or notice required of that
individual shall be completed and filed by that decedent's executor,
administrator, or other person charged with the property of that decedent.
   (c)   If an individual is unable to complete and file a return or notice
required by the City, the return or notice required of that individual shall be
completed and filed by the individual's duly authorized agent, guardian,
conservator, fiduciary, or other person charged with the care of the person or
property of that individual.
   (d)   Returns or notices required of an estate or a trust shall be completed

   (e)   The City shall permit spouses to file a joint return.
   (f)   (1)   Each return required to be filed under this division shall
contain the signature of the taxpayer or the taxpayer's duly authorized agent
and of the person who prepared the return for the taxpayer. The return shall
include the taxpayer's Social Security number or taxpayer identification
number. Each return shall be verified by a declaration under penalty of
perjury.
      (2)   The Tax Administrator shall require a taxpayer who is an individual
to include, with each annual return and amended return, copies of the following
documents: all of the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form W-2, "Wage and
Tax Statements," including all information reported on the taxpayer's Federal
W-2, as well as taxable wages reported or withheld for any municipal
corporation; the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1040 or, in the case
of a return or request required by a qualified municipal corporation, Ohio form
IT-1040; and, with respect to an amended tax return, any other documentation
necessary to support the adjustments made in the amended return. An individual
taxpayer who files the annual return required by this section electronically is
not required to provide paper copies of any of the foregoing to the Tax
Administrator unless the Tax Administrator requests such copies after the
return has been filed.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may require a taxpayer that is not an
individual to include, with each annual net profit return, amended net profit
return, or request for refund required under this section, copies of only the
following documents: the taxpayer's Internal Revenue Service form 1041, form
1065, form 1120, form 1120-REIT, form 1120F, or form 1120S, and, with respect
to an amended tax return or refund request, any other documentation necessary
to support the refund request or the adjustments made in the amended return.
            A taxpayer that is not an individual and that files an annual net
profit return electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway or in some other
manner shall either mail the documents required under this division to the Tax
Administrator at the time of filing or, if electronic submission is available,
submit the documents electronically through the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (4)   After a taxpayer files a tax return, the Tax Administrator may
request, and the taxpayer shall provide, any information, statements, or
documents required by the City to determine and verify the taxpayer's Municipal
income tax liability. The requirements imposed under division (f) of this
section apply regardless of whether the taxpayer files on a generic form or on
a form prescribed by the Tax Administrator.
   (g)   (1)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each
individual income tax return required to be filed under this section shall be
completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator on or before the date
prescribed for the filing of State individual income tax returns under division
(G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08.  The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City.  No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
         B.   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, each annual net
profit return required to be filed under this section by a taxpayer that is not
an individual shall be completed and filed as required by the Tax Administrator
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month following the end of the
taxpayer's taxable year. The taxpayer shall complete and file the return or
notice on forms prescribed by the Tax Administrator or on generic forms,
together with remittance made payable to the City.  No remittance is required
if the net amount due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer that has duly requested an automatic six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return shall
automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City’s income tax
return. The extended due date of the City’s income tax return shall be the
fifteenth day of the tenth month after the last day of the taxable year to
which the return relates. An extension of time to file under this division is
not an extension of the time to pay any tax due unless the Tax Administrator
grants an extension of that date.
         A.   A copy of the Federal extension request shall be included with
the filing of the City’s income tax return.
         B.   A taxpayer that has not requested or received a six-month
extension for filing the taxpayer's Federal income tax return may submit a
written request that the Tax Administrator grant the taxpayer a six-month
extension of the date for filing the taxpayer's City income tax return. If the
request is received by the Tax Administrator on or before the date the City
income tax return is due, the Tax Administrator shall grant the taxpayer's
requested extension.
      (3)   If the Tax Commissioner extends for all taxpayers the date for
filing State income tax returns under division (G) of Ohio R.C. 5747.08, a
taxpayer shall automatically receive an extension for the filing of the City’s
income tax return. The extended due date of the City’s income tax return shall
be the same as the extended due date of the State income tax return.
      (4)   If the Tax Administrator considers it necessary in order to ensure
the payment of the tax imposed by the City, the Tax Administrator may require
taxpayers to file returns and make payments otherwise than as provided in this
division, including taxpayers not otherwise required to file annual returns.
      (5)   To the extent that any provision in this division (g) of this
section conflicts with any provision in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) of this
section, the provisions in divisions (n), (o), (p), or (q) prevail.
   (h)   (1)   For taxable years beginning after 2015, the City shall not
require a taxpayer to remit tax with respect to net profits if the net amount
due is ten dollars ($10.00) or less.
      (2)   Any taxpayer not required to remit tax to the City for a taxable
year pursuant to division (h)(1) of this section shall file with the City an
annual net profit return under division (f)(3) of this section, unless the
provisions of division (h)(3) apply.
      (3)   A.   A person may notify the Tax Administrator that the person does
not expect to be a taxpayer subject to the City income tax ordinance for a
taxable year if both the following apply:
            1.   The person was required to file a tax return with the City for
the immediately preceding taxable year because the person performed services at
a worksite location (as defined in Section
182.04(c)(1)G.) within the City.
            2.   The person no longer provides services in the City and does
not expect to be subject to the City income tax for the taxable year.
         B.   The person shall provide the notice in a signed affidavit that
briefly explains the person's circumstances, including the location of the
previous worksite location and the last date on which the person performed
services or made any sales within the City. The affidavit shall also include
the following statement: “The affiant has no plans to perform any services
within the City, make any sales in the City, or otherwise become subject to the
tax levied by the City during the taxable year, if the affiant does become
subject to the tax levied by the City for the taxable year, the affiant agrees
to be considered a taxpayer and to properly comply as a taxpayer with the City
income tax ordinance and rules and regulations." The person shall sign the
affidavit under penalty of perjury.
         C.   If a person submits an affidavit described in division (h)(3)B.
the Tax Administrator shall not require the person to file and tax return for
the taxable year unless the Tax Administrator possesses information that
conflicts with the affidavit or if the circumstances described in the affidavit
change.
         D.   Nothing in division (h)(3) of this section prohibits the Tax
Administrator from performing an audit of the person.
   (i)   If a payment is made by electronic funds transfer, the payment shall
be considered to be made on the date of the timestamp assigned by the first
electronic system receiving that payment.
   (j)   Taxes withheld for the City by an employer, the agent of an employer,
or other payer as described in Section
182.04 shall be allowed to the taxpayer as credits against payment of the tax
imposed on the taxpayer by the City, unless the amounts withheld were not
remitted to the City and the recipient colluded with the employer, agent, or
other payer in connection with the failure to remit the amounts withheld.
   (k)   Each return required by the City to be filed in accordance with this
division shall include a box that the taxpayer may check to authorize another
person, including a tax return preparer who prepared the return, to communicate
with the Tax Administrator about matters pertaining to the return.
   (l)   The Tax Administrator shall accept for filing a generic form of any
income tax return, report, or document required by the City, provided that the
generic form, once completed and filed, contains all of the information
required by ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations adopted by the City
or the Tax Administrator, and provided that the taxpayer or tax return preparer
filing the generic form otherwise complies with the provisions of this chapter
and of the City’s ordinance, resolution, or rules and regulations governing the
filing of returns, reports, or documents.
Filing via Ohio Business Gateway.
   (m)   (1)   Any taxpayer subject to Municipal income taxation with respect
to the taxpayer's net profit from a business or profession may file the City’s
income tax return, estimated Municipal income tax return, or extension for
filing a Municipal income tax return, and may make payment of amounts shown to
be due on such returns, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (2)   Any employer, agent of an employer, or other payer may report the
amount of Municipal income tax withheld from qualifying wages, and may make
remittance of such amounts, by using the Ohio Business Gateway.
      (3)   Nothing in this section affects the due dates for filing employer
withholding tax returns.
Extension for Service in or for the Armed Forces.
   (n)   Each member of the national guard of any state and each member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to an executive order issued by the President of the United
States or an act of the Congress of the United States, and each civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces, may apply to the Tax Administrator of the City for
both an extension of time for filing of the return and an extension of time for
payment of taxes required by the City during the period of the member's or
civilian's duty service, and for 180 days thereafter. The application shall be
filed on or before the 180th day after the member's or civilian's duty
terminates. An applicant shall provide such evidence as the Tax Administrator
considers necessary to demonstrate eligibility for the extension.
   (o)   (1)   If the Tax Administrator ascertains that an applicant is
qualified for an extension under this section, the Tax Administrator shall
enter into a contract with the applicant for the payment of the tax in
installments that begin on the 181st day after the applicant's active duty or
service terminates. The Tax Administrator may prescribe such contract terms as
the Tax Administrator considers appropriate. However, taxes pursuant to a
contract entered into under this division are not delinquent, and the Tax
Administrator shall not require any payments of penalties or interest in
connection with those taxes for the extension period.
      (2)   If the Tax Administrator determines that an applicant is qualified
for an extension under this section, the applicant shall neither be required to
file any return, report, or other tax document nor be required to pay any tax
otherwise due to the City before the 181st day after the applicant's active
duty or service terminates.
      (3)   Taxes paid pursuant to a contract entered into under division (o)
(1) of this section are not delinquent. The Tax Administrator shall not require
any payments of penalties or interest in connection with those taxes for the
extension period.
   (p)   (1)   Nothing in this division denies to any person described in this
division the application of divisions (n) and (o) of this section.
      (2)   A.   A qualifying taxpayer who is eligible for an extension under
the Internal Revenue Code shall receive both an extension of time in which to
file any return, report, or other tax document and an extension of time in
which to make any payment of taxes required by the City in accordance with this
chapter. The length of any extension granted under division (p)(2)A. of this
section shall be equal to the length of the corresponding extension that the
taxpayer receives under the Internal Revenue Code. As used in this division,
"qualifying taxpayer" means a member of the national guard or a member of a
reserve component of the Armed Forces of the United States called to active
duty pursuant to either an executive order issued by the President of the
United States or an act of the Congress of the United States, or a civilian
serving as support personnel in a combat zone or contingency operation in
support of the Armed Forces.
         B.   Taxes whose payment is extended in accordance with division (p)
(2)A. of this section are not delinquent during the extension period. Such
taxes become delinquent on the first day after the expiration of the extension
period if the taxes are not paid prior to that date. The Tax Administrator
shall not require any payment of penalties or interest in connection with those
taxes for the extension period. The Tax Administrator shall not include any
period of extension granted under division (c)(2)A. of this section in
calculating the penalty or interest due on any unpaid tax.
   (q)   For each taxable year to which division (n), (o), or (p) of this
section applies to a taxpayer, the provisions of divisions (o)(2) and (o)(3) of
this section, as applicable, apply to the spouse of that taxpayer if the filing
status of the spouse and the taxpayer is married filing jointly for that year.
Consolidated Municipal Income Tax Return.
   (r)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Affiliated group of corporations" means an affiliated group as
defined in section 1504 of the Internal Revenue Code, except that, if such a

State, the affiliated group shall not include any incumbent local exchange
carrier that would otherwise be included in the group.
      (2)   "Consolidated Federal income tax return" means a consolidated
return filed for Federal income tax purposes pursuant to section 1501 of the
Internal Revenue Code.
      (3)   "Consolidated Federal taxable income" means the consolidated
taxable income of an affiliated group of corporations, as computed for the
purposes of filing a consolidated Federal income tax return, before
consideration of net operating losses or special deductions. "Consolidated
Federal taxable income" does not include income or loss of an incumbent local
exchange carrier that is excluded from the affiliated group under division (r)
(1) of this section.
      (4)   "Incumbent local exchange carrier" has the same meaning as in Ohio
R.C. 4927.01.

R.C. 5727.01.
   (s)   (1)   For taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2016, a
taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations may elect to
file a consolidated Municipal income tax return for a taxable year if at least
one member of the affiliated group of corporations is subject to the City’s
income tax in that taxable year, and if the affiliated group of corporations
filed a consolidated Federal income tax return with respect to that taxable
year. The election is binding for a five-year period beginning with the first
taxable year of the initial election unless a change in the reporting method is
required under Federal law. The election continues to be binding for each
subsequent five-year period unless the taxpayer elects to discontinue filing
consolidated Municipal income tax returns under division (s)(2) of this section
or a taxpayer receives permission from the Tax Administrator. The Tax
Administrator shall approve such a request for good cause shown.
      (2)   An election to discontinue filing consolidated Municipal income tax
returns under this section must be made in the first year following the last
year of a five-year consolidated Municipal income tax return election period in
effect under division (s)(1) of this section. The election to discontinue
filing a consolidated Municipal income tax return is binding for a five-year
period beginning with the first taxable year of the election.
      (3)   An election made under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this section is
binding on all members of the affiliated group of corporations subject to a
Municipal income tax.
      (4)   When a taxpayer makes the election allowed under Ohio R.C.718.80, a
valid election made by the taxpayer under division (s)(1) or (s)(2) of this
section is binding upon the Tax Administrator for the remainder of the five-
year period.
      (5)   When an election made under Ohio R.C. 718.80 is terminated, a valid
election made under Ohio R.C. 718.86 is binding upon the Tax Administrator for
the remainder of the five-year period.
   (t)   A taxpayer that is a member of an affiliated group of corporations
that filed a consolidated Federal income tax return for a taxable year shall
file a consolidated City income tax return for that taxable year if the Tax
Administrator determines, by a preponderance of the evidence, that intercompany
transactions have not been conducted at arm's length and that there has been a
distortive shifting of income or expenses with regard to allocation of net
profits to the City.  A taxpayer that is required to file a consolidated City
income tax return for a taxable year shall file a consolidated City income tax
return for all subsequent taxable years, unless the taxpayer requests and
receives written permission from the Tax Administrator to file a separate
return or a taxpayer has experienced a change in circumstances.
   (u)   A taxpayer shall prepare a consolidated City income tax return in the
same manner as is required under the United States Department of Treasury

Federal income tax return required to be filed by the common parent of the
affiliated group of which the taxpayer is a member.
   (v)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in divisions (v)(2), (v)(3), and
(v)(4) of this section, corporations that file a consolidated Municipal income
tax return shall compute adjusted Federal taxable income, as defined in Section
182.02, by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income" for "federal
taxable income" wherever "federal taxable income" appears in that division and
by substituting "an affiliated group of corporation's" for "a C corporation's"
wherever "a C corporation's" appears in that division.
      (2)   No corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall
make any adjustment otherwise required under Section
182.02(c)(1) to the extent that the item of income or deduction otherwise
subject to the adjustment has been eliminated or consolidated in the
computation of consolidated Federal taxable income.
      (3)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having at least
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
the corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return shall do one of
the following with respect to that pass-through entity's net profit or loss for
that taxable year:
         A.   Exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so excluded, the
entity shall be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of the
entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
         B.   Include the pass-through entity's net profit or loss in the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purpose of making the computations required in Section
182.05(r) through (y), include the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City. If the entity's net profit or loss is so included, the
entity shall not be subject to taxation as a separate taxpayer on the basis of
the entity's net profits that are included in the consolidated Federal taxable
income of the affiliated group.
      (4)   If the net profit or loss of a pass-through entity having less than
eighty percent of the value of its ownership interest owned or controlled,
directly or indirectly, by an affiliated group of corporations is included in
that affiliated group's consolidated Federal taxable income for a taxable year,
all of the following shall apply:
         A.   The corporation filing the consolidated Municipal income tax
return shall exclude the pass-through entity's net profit or loss from the
consolidated Federal taxable income of the affiliated group and, for the
purposes of making the computations required in Section
182.05(r) through (y), exclude the property, payroll, and gross receipts of the
pass-through entity in the computation of the affiliated group's net profit
sitused to the City;
         B.   The pass-through entity shall be subject to the City income
taxation as a separate taxpayer in accordance with this chapter on the basis of
the entity's net profits that would otherwise be included in the consolidated
Federal taxable income of the affiliated group.
   (w)   Corporations filing a consolidated City income tax return shall make
the computations required under Section
182.05(r) through (y) by substituting "consolidated Federal taxable income
attributable to" for "net profit from" wherever "net profit from" appears in
that section and by substituting "affiliated group of corporations" for
"taxpayer" wherever "taxpayer" appears in that section.
   (x)   Each corporation filing a consolidated City income tax return is
jointly and severally liable for any tax, interest, penalties, fines, charges,
or other amounts imposed by the City in accordance with this chapter on the
corporation, an affiliated group of which the corporation is a member for any
portion of the taxable year, or any one or more members of such an affiliated
group.
   (y)   Corporations and their affiliates that made an election or entered
into an agreement with the City before January 1, 2016, to file a consolidated
or combined tax return with the City may continue to file consolidated or
combined tax returns in accordance with such election or agreement for taxable
years beginning on and after January 1, 2016.

   (a)   Every individual taxpayer domiciled in the City who is required to and
does pay, or has acknowledged liability for, a municipal tax to another
municipality on or measured by the same income, qualifying wages, commissions,
net profits or other compensation taxable under this chapter, may claim a
nonrefundable credit against the tax imposed by this chapter upon satisfactory
evidence that tax has been paid to another municipality. Subject to division
(c) of this section, if the tax rate of the other municipality is the same or
lower than Canal Fulton's tax rate, the credit shall not exceed fifty percent
of the tax paid to the other municipality. If the other municipality's tax rate
is higher than Canal Fulton's tax rate, the credit shall not exceed fifty
percent of the Canal Fulton tax rate.
   (b)   The City shall grant a credit against its tax on income to a resident
of the City who works in a joint economic development zone created under Ohio
R.C. 715.691 or a joint economic development district created under Ohio R.C.
715.70, 715.71, or 715.72 to the same extent that it grants a credit against
its tax on income to its residents who are employed in another municipal
corporation.
   (c)   If the amount of tax withheld or paid to the other municipality is
less than the amount of tax required to be withheld or paid to the other
municipality, then for purposes of division (a) of this section, the income,
qualifying wages, commissions, net profits or other compensation subject to tax
in the other municipality shall be limited to the amount computed by dividing
the tax withheld or paid to the other municipality by the tax rate for that
municipality.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.07  ESTIMATED TAXES.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Estimated taxes" means the amount that the taxpayer reasonably
estimates to be the taxpayer's tax liability for the City’s income tax for the
current taxable year.
      (2)   "Tax liability" means the total taxes due to the City for the
taxable year, after allowing any credit to which the taxpayer is entitled, and
after applying any estimated tax payment, withholding payment, or credit from
another taxable year.
   (b)   (1)   Every taxpayer shall make a declaration of estimated taxes for
the current taxable year, on the form prescribed by the Tax Administrator, if

         A.   Taxes withheld for the City from qualifying wages shall be
considered as paid to the City in equal amounts on each payment date unless the
taxpayer establishes the dates on which all amounts were actually withheld, in
which case they shall be considered as paid on the dates on which the amounts
were actually withheld.
         B.   An overpayment of tax applied as a credit to a subsequent taxable
year is deemed to be paid on the date of the postmark stamped on the cover in

the postmark" means, in the event there is more than one date on the cover, the
earliest date imprinted on the cover by the postal service.

      (4)   Taxpayers reporting on a fiscal year basis shall file a declaration
on or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the beginning of each
fiscal year or period.
      (5)   The original declaration or any subsequent amendment may be
increased or decreased on or before any subsequent quarterly payment day as
provided in this section.
   (c)   (1)   The required portion of the tax liability for the taxable year
that shall be paid through estimated taxes made payable to the City, including
the application of tax refunds to estimated taxes and withholding on or before
the applicable payment date, shall be as follows:
         A.   On or before the fifteenth day of the fourth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, twenty-two and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         B.   On or before the fifteenth day of the sixth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, forty-five percent of the tax liability for the
taxable year;
         C.   On or before the fifteenth day of the ninth month after the
beginning of the taxable year, sixty-seven and one-half percent of the tax
liability for the taxable year;
         D.   On or before the fifteenth day of the twelfth month of the

   (d)   (1)   In the case of any underpayment of any portion of a tax
liability, penalty and interest may be imposed pursuant to Section

the underpayment is due to reasonable cause as described in division (e) of
this section. The amount of the underpayment shall be determined as follows:

percent of the tax liability for the current taxable year, determined by
annualizing the income received during the year up to the end of the month
immediately preceding the month in which the payment is due.
      (2)   The amount of estimated taxes that were paid equals at least 100
percent of the tax liability shown on the return of the taxpayer for the
preceding taxable year, provided that the immediately preceding taxable year
reflected a period of twelve months and the taxpayer filed a return with the
City under Section
182.05 for that year.
      (3)   The taxpayer is an individual who resides in the City but was not
domiciled there on the first day of January of the calendar year that includes
the first day of the taxable year.

182.08  ROUNDING OF AMOUNTS.
   A person may round to the nearest whole dollar all amounts the person is
required to enter on any return, report, voucher, or other document required

(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.09  REQUESTS FOR REFUNDS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "withholding tax" has the same meaning as in
Section
182.18.
   (b)   Upon receipt of a request for a refund, the Tax Administrator, in
accordance with this section, shall refund to employers, agents of employers,
other payers, or taxpayers, with respect to any income or withholding tax
levied by the City:
      (1)   Overpayments of ten dollars ($10.00) or more;
      (2)   Amounts paid erroneously if the refund requested is ten dollars
($10.00) or more.
   (c)   (1)   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, requests for
refund shall be filed with the Tax Administrator, on the form prescribed by the
Tax Administrator within three years after the tax was due or paid, whichever
is later. The Tax Administrator may require the requestor to file with the
request any documentation that substantiates the requestor's claim for a
refund.
      (2)   On filing of the refund request, the Tax Administrator shall
determine the amount of refund due and certify such amount for payment. Except
as provided in division (c)(3) of this section, the Tax Administrator shall
issue an assessment to any taxpayer whose request for refund is fully or
partially denied. The assessment shall state the amount of the refund that was
denied, the reasons for the denial, and instructions for appealing the
assessment.
      (3)   If the Tax Administrator denies in whole or in part a refund
request included within the taxpayer's originally filed annual income tax
return, the Tax Administrator shall notify the taxpayer, in writing, of the
amount of the refund that was denied, the reasons for the denial, and
instructions for requesting an assessment that may be appealed under Section
182.21.
   (d)   A request for a refund that is received after the last day for filing
specified in division (c) of this section shall be considered to have been
filed in a timely manner if any of the following situations exist:
      (1)   The request is delivered by the postal service, and the earliest
postal service postmark on the cover in which the request is enclosed is not
later than the last day for filing the request.
      (2)   The request is delivered by the postal service, the only postmark
on the cover in which the request is enclosed was affixed by a private postal
meter, the date of that postmark is not later than the last day for filing the
request, and the request is received within seven days of such last day.
      (3)   The request is delivered by the postal service, no postmark date
was affixed to the cover in which the request is enclosed or the date of the
postmark so affixed is not legible, and the request is received within seven
days of the last day for making the request.
   (e)   Interest shall be allowed and paid on any overpayment by a taxpayer of
any Municipal income tax obligation from the date of the overpayment until the
date of the refund of the overpayment, except that if any overpayment is
refunded within ninety days after the final filing date of the annual return or
ninety days after the completed return is filed, whichever is later, no
interest shall be allowed on the refund. For the purpose of computing the
payment of interest on amounts overpaid, no amount of tax for any taxable year
shall be considered to have been paid before the date on which the return on
which the tax is reported is due, without regard to any extension of time for
filing that return. Interest shall be paid at the interest rate described in
Section
182.18(a)(4).

182.10  SECOND MUNICIPALITY IMPOSING TAX AFTER TIME PERIOD ALLOWED FOR REFUND.
   (a)   Income tax that has been deposited with the City, but should have been
deposited with another municipality, is allowable by the City as a refund but
is subject to the three-year limitation on refunds.
   (b)   Income tax that was deposited with another municipality but should
have been deposited with the City is subject to recovery by the City.  If the
City’s tax on that income is imposed after the time period allowed for a refund
of the tax or withholding paid to the other municipality, the City shall allow
a nonrefundable credit against the tax or withholding the City claims is due
with respect to such income or wages, equal to the tax or withholding paid to
the first municipality with respect to such income or wages.
   (c)   If the City’s tax rate is less than the tax rate in the other
municipality, then the nonrefundable credit shall be calculated using the
City’s tax rate.  However, if the City’s tax rate is greater than the tax rate
in the other municipality, the tax due in excess of the nonrefundable credit is
to be paid to the City, along with any penalty and interest that accrued during
the period of nonpayment.
   (d)   Nothing in this section permits any credit carryforward.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.11  AMENDED RETURNS.
   (a)   (1)   If a taxpayer's tax liability shown on the annual tax return for
the City changes as a result of an adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or
State income tax return, the taxpayer shall file an amended return with the
City.  The amended return shall be filed on a form required by the Tax
Administrator.
      (2)   If a taxpayer intends to file an amended consolidated Municipal
income tax return, or to amend its type of return from a separate return to a
consolidated return, based on the taxpayer's consolidated Federal income tax
return, the taxpayer shall notify the Tax Administrator before filing the
amended return.
   (b)   (1)   In the case of an underpayment, the amended return shall be
accompanied by payment of any combined additional tax due, together with any
penalty and interest thereon. If the combined tax shown to be due is ten
dollars ($10.00) or less, no payment need be made. The amended return shall
reopen those facts, figures, computations, or attachments from a previously
filed return that are not affected, either directly or indirectly, by the
adjustment to the taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return only.
         A.   To determine the amount of tax that would be due if all facts,
figures, computations, and attachments were reopened; or,
         B.   If the applicable statute of limitations for civil actions or
prosecutions under Section
182.12 has not expired for a previously filed return.
      (2)   The additional tax to be paid shall not exceed the amount of tax
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened; i.e., the payment shall be the lesser of the two amounts.
   (c)   (1)   In the case of an overpayment, a request for refund may be filed
under this division within the period prescribed by division (d) of this
section for filing the amended return, even if it is filed beyond the period
prescribed in that division if it otherwise conforms to the requirements of
that division. If the amount of the refund is less than ten dollars ($10.00),
no refund need be paid by the City. A request filed under this division shall
claim refund of overpayments resulting from alterations only to those facts,
figures, computations, or attachments required in the taxpayer's annual return
that are affected, either directly or indirectly, by the adjustment to the
taxpayer's Federal or State income tax return, unless it is also filed within
the time prescribed in Section
182.09.
      (2)   The amount to be refunded shall not exceed the amount of refund
that would be due if all facts, figures, computations, and attachments were
reopened. All facts, figures, computations, and attachments may be reopened to
determine the refund amount due by inclusion of all facts, figures,
computations, and attachments.
   (d)   Within sixty days after the final determination of any Federal or
State tax liability affecting the taxpayer's City’s tax liability, that
taxpayer shall make and file an amended City return showing income subject to
the City income tax based upon such final determination of Federal or State tax
liability. The taxpayer shall pay any additional City income tax shown due
thereon or make a claim for refund of any overpayment, unless the tax or
overpayment is less than ten dollars ($10.00).

182.12  LIMITATIONS.

period, if any.
         B.   The time limit described in division (a)(1)A. of this section may
be extended at any time if both the Tax Administrator and the employer, agent
of the employer, other payer, or taxpayer consent in writing to the extension.
Any extension shall also extend for the same period of time the time limit
described in division (c) of this section.
      (2)   As used in this section, "qualifying deferral period" means a
period of time beginning and ending as follows:
         A.   Beginning on the date a person who is aggrieved by an assessment
files with the Board of Review the request described in Section
182.21. That date shall not be affected by any subsequent decision, finding, or
holding by any administrative body or court that the Board of Review did not
have jurisdiction to affirm, reverse, or modify the assessment or any part of
that assessment.
         B.   Ending the later of the sixtieth day after the date on which the
final determination of the Board of Review becomes final or, if any party
appeals from the determination of the Board of Review, the sixtieth day after
the date on which the final determination of the Board of Review is either
ultimately affirmed in whole or in part or ultimately reversed and no further
appeal of either that affirmation, in whole or in part, or that reversal is
available or taken.
   (b)   Prosecutions for an offense made punishable under a resolution or
ordinance imposing an income tax shall be commenced within three years after
the commission of the offense, provided that in the case of fraud, failure to
file a return, or the omission of twenty-five percent or more of income
required to be reported, prosecutions may be commenced within six years after
the commission of the offense.
   (c)   A claim for a refund of Municipal income taxes shall be brought within
the time limitation provided in Section
182.09.
   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding the fact that an appeal is pending, the
petitioner may pay all or a portion of the assessment that is the subject of
the appeal. The acceptance of a payment by the City does not prejudice any
claim for refund upon final determination of the appeal.
      (2)   If upon final determination of the appeal an error in the
assessment is corrected by the Tax Administrator, upon an appeal so filed or
pursuant to a final determination of the Board of Review, of the Ohio Board of
Tax Appeals, or any court to which the decision of the Ohio Board of Tax
Appeals has been appealed, so that the resultant amount due is less than the
amount paid, a refund will be paid in the amount of the overpayment as provided
by Section
182.09, with interest on that amount as provided by Section
182.09(e).
   (e)   No civil action to recover the City income tax or related penalties or
interest shall be brought during either of the following time periods:
      (1)   The period during which a taxpayer has a right to appeal the
imposition of that tax or interest or those penalties;
      (2)   The period during which an appeal related to the imposition of that
tax or interest or those penalties is pending.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.13  AUDITS.
   (a)   At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
provide to the taxpayer a written description of the roles of the Tax
Administrator and of the taxpayer during the audit and a statement of the
taxpayer's rights, including any right to obtain a refund of an overpayment of
a tax. At or before the commencement of an audit, the Tax Administrator shall
inform the taxpayer when the audit is considered to have commenced.
   (b)   Except in cases involving suspected criminal activity, the Tax
Administrator shall conduct an audit of a taxpayer during regular business
hours and after providing reasonable notice to the taxpayer. A taxpayer who is
unable to comply with a proposed time for an audit on the grounds that the
proposed time would cause inconvenience or hardship must offer reasonable
alternative dates for the audit.
   (c)   At all stages of an audit by the Tax Administrator, a taxpayer is
entitled to be assisted or represented by an attorney, accountant, bookkeeper,
or other tax practitioner. The Tax Administrator shall prescribe a form by
which a taxpayer may designate such a person to assist or represent the
taxpayer in the conduct of any proceedings resulting from actions by the Tax
Administrator. If a taxpayer has not submitted such a form, the Tax
Administrator may accept other evidence, as the Tax Administrator considers
appropriate, that a person is the authorized representative of a taxpayer.
   A taxpayer may refuse to answer any questions asked by the person conducting
an audit until the taxpayer has an opportunity to consult with the taxpayer's
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner.
   This division does not authorize the practice of law by a person who is not
an attorney.
   (d)   A taxpayer may record, electronically or otherwise, the audit
examination.
   (e)   The failure of the Tax Administrator to comply with a provision of
this section shall neither excuse a taxpayer from payment of any taxes owed by
the taxpayer nor cure any procedural defect in a taxpayer's case.
   (f)   If the Tax Administrator fails to substantially comply with the
provisions of this section, the Tax Administrator, upon application by the
taxpayer, shall excuse the taxpayer from penalties and interest.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.14  SERVICE OF ASSESSMENT.
   (a)   As used in this section:
      (1)   "Last known address" means the address the Tax Administrator has at
the time a document is originally sent by certified mail, or any address the
Tax Administrator can ascertain using reasonable means such as the use of a
change of address service offered by the postal service or an authorized
delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056.
      (2)   "Undeliverable address" means an address to which the postal
service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C. 5703.056 is not able
to deliver an assessment of the Tax Administrator, except when the reason for
non-delivery is because the addressee fails to acknowledge or accept the
assessment.
   (b)   Subject to division (c) of this section, a copy of each assessment
shall be served upon the person affected thereby either by personal service, by
certified mail, or by a delivery service authorized under Ohio R.C. 5703.056. 
With the permission of the person affected by an assessment, the Tax
Administrator may deliver the assessment through alternative means as provided
in this section, including, but not limited to, delivery by secure electronic
mail.
   (c)   (1)   A.   If certified mail is returned because of an undeliverable
address, the Tax Administrator shall utilize reasonable means to ascertain a
new last known address, including the use of a change of address service
offered by the postal service or an authorized delivery service under Ohio R.C.
5703.056. If the Tax Administrator is unable to ascertain a new last known
address, the assessment shall be sent by ordinary mail and considered served.
If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an undeliverable
address, the assessment remains appealable within sixty days after the
assessment's postmark.
         B.   Once the Tax Administrator or other City official, or the
designee of either, serves an assessment on the person to whom the assessment
is directed, the person may protest the ruling of that assessment by filing an
appeal with the Board of Review within sixty days after the receipt of service.
The delivery of an assessment of the Tax Administrator under division (c)(1)A.
of this section is prima facie evidence that delivery is complete and that the
assessment is served.
      (2)   If mailing of an assessment by the Tax Administrator by certified
mail is returned for some cause other than an undeliverable address, the Tax
Administrator shall resend the assessment by ordinary mail. The assessment
shall show the date the Tax Administrator sends the assessment and include the
following statement:
            "This assessment is deemed to be served on the addressee under
applicable law ten days from the date this assessment was mailed by the Tax
Administrator as shown on the assessment, and all periods within which an
appeal may be filed apply from and after that date."
            Unless the mailing is returned because of an undeliverable address,
the mailing of that information is prima facie evidence that delivery of the
assessment was completed ten days after the Tax Administrator sent the
assessment by ordinary mail and that the assessment was served.
            If the ordinary mail is subsequently returned because of an
undeliverable address, the Tax Administrator shall proceed under division (c)
(1)A. of this section. A person may challenge the presumption of delivery and
service under this division in accordance with division (d) of this section.
   (d)   (1)   A person disputing the presumption of delivery and service under
division (c) of this section bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of
the evidence that the address to which the assessment was sent by certified
mail was not an address with which the person was associated at the time the
Tax Administrator originally mailed the assessment. For the purposes of this
section, a person is associated with an address at the time the Tax
Administrator originally mailed the assessment if, at that time, the person was
residing, receiving legal documents, or conducting business at the address; or
if, before that time, the person had conducted business at the address and,
when the assessment was mailed, the person's agent or the person's affiliate
was conducting business at the address. For the purposes of this section, a
person's affiliate is any other person that, at the time the assessment was
mailed, owned or controlled at least twenty percent, as determined by voting
rights, of the addressee's business.
      (2)   If a person elects to appeal an assessment on the basis described
in division (d)(1) of this section, and if that assessment is subject to
collection and is not otherwise appealable, the person must do so within sixty
days after the initial contact by the Tax Administrator or other City official,
or the designee of either, with the person. Nothing in this division prevents
the Tax Administrator or other official from entering into a compromise with
the person if the person does not actually file such an appeal with the Board
of Review.
   (e)   Nothing in this section prohibits the Tax Administrator or the Tax
Administrator's designee from delivering an assessment by personal service.
   (f)   Collection actions taken upon any assessment being appealed under
division (c)(1)B. of this section, including those on which a claim has been
delivered for collection, shall be stayed upon the pendency of an appeal under
this section.
   (g)   Additional regulations as detailed in the Rules and Regulations shall
apply.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.15  ADMINISTRATION OF CLAIMS.
   (a)   As used in this section, "claim" means a claim for an amount payable
to the City that arises pursuant to the City’s income tax imposed in accordance
with this chapter.
   (b)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from doing
either of the following if such action is in the best interests of the City:
      (1)   Compromise a claim;
      (2)   Extend for a reasonable period the time for payment of a claim by
agreeing to accept monthly or other periodic payments.
   (c)   The Tax Administrator's rejection of a compromise or payment-over-time
agreement proposed by a person with respect to a claim shall not be appealable.
   (d)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be binding upon and shall be to the benefit of only the parties to the
compromise or agreement, and shall not eliminate or otherwise affect the
liability of any other person.
   (e)   A compromise or payment-over-time agreement with respect to a claim
shall be void if the taxpayer defaults under the compromise or agreement or if
the compromise or agreement was obtained by fraud or by misrepresentation of a
material fact. Any amount that was due before the compromise or agreement and
that is unpaid shall remain due, and any penalties or interest that would have
accrued in the absence of the compromise or agreement shall continue to accrue
and be due.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.16  TAX INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL.
   (a)   Any information gained as a result of returns, investigations,
hearings, or verifications required or authorized by this chapter is
confidential, and no person shall access or disclose such information except in
accordance with a proper judicial order or in connection with the performance
of that person's official duties or the official business of the City as
authorized by this chapter. The Tax Administrator or a designee thereof may
furnish copies of returns filed or otherwise received under this chapter and
other related tax information to the Internal Revenue Service, the Tax
Commissioner, and tax administrators of other municipal corporations.
   (b)   This section does not prohibit the City from publishing or disclosing
statistics in a form that does not disclose information with respect to
particular taxpayers.
(Ord. 30-15.  Passed 11-17-15; Ord. 3-18.  Passed 1-16-18.)
182.17  FRAUD.
   No person shall knowingly make, present, aid, or assist in the preparation
or presentation of a false or fraudulent report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document authorized or required by the City ordinance or State law to
be filed with the Tax Administrator, or knowingly procure, counsel, or advise
the preparation or presentation of such report, return, schedule, statement,
claim, or document, or knowingly change, alter, or amend, or knowingly procure,
counsel or advise such change, alteration, or amendment of the records upon
which such report, return, schedule, statement, claim, or document is based
with intent to defraud the City or the Tax Administrator.

182.19  AUTHORITY OF TAX ADMINISTRATOR; VERIFICATION OF INFORMATION.
Authority.
   (a)   Nothing in this chapter shall limit the authority of the Tax
Administrator to perform any of the following duties or functions, unless the
performance of such duties or functions is expressly limited by a provision of
the Ohio Revised Code:
      (1)   A.   Exercise all powers whatsoever of a query nature as provided
by law, including, the right to inspect books, accounts, records, memorandums,
and Federal and State income tax returns, to examine persons under oath, to
issue orders or subpoenas for the production of books, accounts, papers,
records, documents, and testimony, to take depositions, to apply to a court for
attachment proceedings as for contempt, to approve vouchers for the fees of
officers and witnesses, and to administer oaths.
         B.   The powers referred to in this division of this section shall be
exercised by the Tax Administrator only in connection with the performance of
the duties respectively assigned to the Tax Administrator under the City’s
income tax ordinance;
      (2)   Appoint agents and prescribe their powers and duties;
      (3)   Confer and meet with officers of other municipal corporations and
states and officers of the United States on any matters pertaining to their
respective official duties as provided by law;
      (4)   Exercise the authority provided by law, including orders from
bankruptcy courts, relative to remitting or refunding taxes, including
penalties and interest thereon, for any reason overpaid. In addition, the Tax
Administrator may investigate any claim of overpayment and, if the Tax
Administrator finds that there has been an overpayment, make a written
statement of the Tax Administrator's findings, and approve and issue a refund
payable to the taxpayer, the taxpayer's assigns, or legal representative as
provided in this chapter;
      (5)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to consenting to
the compromise and settlement of tax claims;
      (6)   Exercise the authority provided by law relative to the use of
alternative apportionment methods by taxpayers in accordance with Section
182.03;
      (7)   A.   Make all tax findings, determinations, computations, and
orders the Tax Administrator is by law authorized and required to make and,
pursuant to time limitations provided by law, on the Tax Administrator's own
motion, review, re-determine, or correct any tax findings, determinations,
computations, or orders the Tax Administrator has made;
         B.   If an appeal has been filed with the Board of Review or other
appropriate tribunal, the Tax Administrator shall not review, re-determine, or
correct any tax finding, determination, computation, or order which the Tax
Administrator has made, unless such appeal or application is withdrawn by the
appellant or applicant, is dismissed, or is otherwise final;
      (8)   Destroy any or all returns or other tax documents in the manner
authorized by law;
      (9)   Enter into an agreement with a taxpayer to simplify the withholding
obligations described in Section
182.04.
Verification of Accuracy of Returns and Determination of Liability.
   (b)   (1)   The Tax Administrator, or any authorized agent or employee
thereof may examine the books, papers, records, and Federal and State income
tax returns of any employer, taxpayer, or other person that is subject to, or
that the Tax Administrator believes is subject to, the provisions of this
chapter for the purpose of verifying the accuracy of any return made or, if no
return was filed, to ascertain the tax due under this chapter, including
preparation of an estimated return in lieu of an unfiled return. Upon written
request by the Tax Administrator or a duly authorized agent or employee
thereof, every employer, taxpayer, or other person subject to this section is
required to furnish the opportunity for the Tax Administrator, authorized
agent, or employee to investigate and examine such books, papers, records, and
Federal and State income tax returns at a reasonable time and place designated
in the request.
            In any case where a taxpayer has failed to file a return which does
not show the proper amount of tax due, the Tax Administrator may determine the
amount of tax appearing to be due to the City from the taxpayer and shall send
to such taxpayer a written statement showing the amount of tax so determined
together with interest and penalties thereon, if any. If the taxpayer fails to
respond to the assessment within 30 days, the assessment shall become final and
the tax, penalties, and interest assessed shall become due and payable and
collectible as are other unpaid taxes.
      (2)   The records and other documents of any taxpayer, employer, or other
person that is subject to, or that the Tax Administrator believes is subject
to, the provisions of this chapter shall be open to the Tax Administrator's
inspection during business hours and shall be preserved for a period of six
years following the end of the taxable year to which the records or documents
relate, unless the Tax Administrator, in writing, consents to their destruction
within that period, or by order requires that they be kept longer. The Tax
Administrator may require any person, by notice served on that person, to keep
such records as the Tax Administrator determines necessary to show whether or
not that person is liable, and the extent of such liability, for the income tax
levied by the City or for the withholding of such tax.
      (3)   The Tax Administrator may examine under oath any person that the
Tax Administrator reasonably believes has knowledge concerning any income that
was or would have been returned for taxation or any transaction tending to
affect such income. The Tax Administrator may, for this purpose, compel any
such person to attend a hearing or examination and to produce any books,
papers, records, and Federal and State income tax returns in such person's
possession or control. The person may be assisted or represented by an
attorney, accountant, bookkeeper, or other tax practitioner at any such hearing
or examination. This division does not authorize the practice of law by a
person who is not an attorney.
      (4)   No person issued written notice by the Tax Administrator compelling
attendance at a hearing or examination or the production of books, papers,
records, or Federal or State income tax returns under this section shall fail
to comply.
Identification Information.
   (c)   (1)   Nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax Administrator from
requiring any person filing a tax document with the Tax Administrator to
provide identifying information, which may include the person's Social Security
number, Federal employer identification number, or other identification number
requested by the Tax Administrator. A person required by the Tax Administrator
to provide identifying information that has experienced any change with respect
to that information shall notify the Tax Administrator of the change before, or
upon, filing the next tax document requiring the identifying information.
      (2)   A.   If the Tax Administrator makes a request for identifying
information and the Tax Administrator does not receive valid identifying
information within thirty days of making the request, nothing in this chapter
prohibits the Tax Administrator from imposing a penalty upon the person to whom
the request was directed pursuant to Section
182.18, in addition to any applicable penalty described in Section
182.99.
         B.   If a person required by the Tax Administrator to provide
identifying information does not notify the Tax Administrator of a change with
respect to that information as required under Section
182.19(c) within thirty days after filing the next tax document requiring such
identifying information, nothing in this chapter prohibits the Tax
Administrator from imposing a penalty pursuant to Section
182.18.
         C.   The penalties provided for under divisions (c)(2)A. and B. of
this section may be billed and imposed in the same manner as the tax or fee
with respect to which the identifying information is sought and are in addition
to any applicable criminal penalties described in Section
182.99 for a violation of Section
182.17 and any other penalties that may be imposed by the Tax Administrator by
law.

this section with respect to prospective Municipal income tax liability. It
does not include ordinary correspondence of the Tax Administrator.
   (b)   A taxpayer may submit a written request for an opinion of the Tax
Administrator in accordance with the Rules and Regulations.
   (c)   A taxpayer is not relieved of tax liability for any activity or
transaction related to a request for an opinion that contained any
misrepresentation or omission of one or more material facts.
   (d)   The Tax Administrator may refuse to offer an opinion on any request
received under this section. Such refusal is not subject to appeal.
   (e)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator binds the Tax Administrator only
with respect to the taxpayer for whom the opinion was prepared and does not
bind the Tax Administrator of any other municipal corporation.
   (f)   An opinion of the Tax Administrator issued under this section is not
subject to appeal.

shall be appointed by the legislative authority of the City, but such
appointees may not be employees, elected officials, or contractors with the
City at any time during their term or in the five years (which applies only to
these two appointments) immediately preceding the date of appointment. One
member shall be appointed by the Mayor.  This member may be an employee of the
City, but may not be the Director of Finance or equivalent officer, or the Tax
Administrator or other similar official or an employee directly involved in
municipal tax matters, or any direct subordinate thereof.
      (2)   The term for members of the Board of Review shall be two years.
There is no limit on the number of terms that a member may serve if the member
is reappointed by the legislative authority. The board member appointed by the
Mayor shall serve at the discretion of the administrative official.
      (3)   Members of the Board of Review appointed by the legislative
authority may be removed by the legislative authority by majority vote for
malfeasance, misfeasance, or nonfeasance in office. To remove such a member,
the legislative authority must give the member a copy of the charges against
the member and afford the member an opportunity to be publicly heard in person
or by counsel in the member's own defense upon not less than ten days' notice.
The decision by the legislative authority on the charges is final and not
appealable.
      (4)   A member of the Board of Review who, for any reason, ceases to meet
the qualifications for the position prescribed by this section shall resign
immediately by operation of law.
      (5)   A vacancy in an unexpired term shall be filled in the same manner
as the original appointment within sixty days of when the vacancy was created.
Any member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the
term for which the member's predecessor was appointed shall hold office for the
remainder of such term. No vacancy on the Board of Review shall impair the
power and authority of the remaining members to exercise all the powers of the
Board of Review.
      (6)   If a member is temporarily unable to serve on the Board of Review
due to a conflict of interest, illness, absence, or similar reason, the
legislative authority or top administrative official that appointed the member
shall appoint another individual to temporarily serve on the Board of Review in
the member's place. The appointment of such an individual shall be subject to
the same requirements and limitations as are applicable to the appointment of
the member temporarily unable to serve.
   (b)   Whenever the Tax Administrator issues an assessment, the Tax
Administrator shall notify the taxpayer in writing at the same time of the
taxpayer's right to appeal the assessment, the manner in which the taxpayer may
appeal the assessment, and the address to which the appeal should be directed.
   (c)   Any person who has been issued an assessment may appeal the assessment
to the Board of Review by filing a request with the Board of Review. The
request shall be in writing, shall specify the reason or reasons why the
assessment should be deemed incorrect or unlawful, and shall be filed within
sixty days after the taxpayer receives the assessment.
   (d)   The Board of Review shall schedule a hearing to be held within sixty
days after receiving an appeal of an assessment under division (c) of this
section, unless the taxpayer requests additional time to prepare or waives a
hearing. If the taxpayer does not waive the hearing, the taxpayer may appear
before the Board of Review and may be represented by an attorney at law,
certified public accountant, or other representative. The Board of Review may
allow a hearing to be continued as jointly agreed to by the parties. In such a
case, the hearing must be completed within 120 days after the first day of the
hearing unless the parties agree otherwise.
   (e)   The Board of Review may affirm, reverse, or modify the Tax
Administrator's assessment or any part of that assessment. The Board of Review
shall issue a final determination on the appeal within ninety days after the
Board of Review's final hearing on the appeal, and send a copy of its final
determination by ordinary mail to all of the parties to the appeal within
fifteen days after issuing the final determination. The taxpayer or the Tax
Administrator may appeal the Board of Review's final determination as provided
in Ohio R.C. 5717.011.
   (f)   The Board of Review created pursuant to this section shall adopt rules
governing its procedures and shall keep a record of its transactions. Such
records are not public records available for inspection under Ohio R.C.
149.43.  Hearings requested by a taxpayer before a Board of Review created

313.02  THROUGH STREETS; STOP AND YIELD RIGHT-OF-WAY SIGNS.
   (a)   All State routes are hereby designated as through streets or highways,
provided that stop signs, yield signs or traffic control signals shall be
erected at all intersections with such through streets or highways, except as
otherwise provided in this section.  Where two or more State routes that are
through streets or highways intersect and no traffic control signal is in
operation, stop signs or yield signs shall be erected at one or more entrances
thereto by the Ohio Department of Transportation, except as otherwise provided
in this section.
   Whenever the Ohio Director of Transportation determines on the basis of an
engineering and traffic investigation that stop signs are necessary to stop
traffic on a through highway for safe and efficient operation, nothing in this
section shall be construed to prevent such installations.  When circumstances
warrant, the Director also may omit stop signs on roadways intersecting through
highways under his jurisdiction.  Before the Director either installs or
removes a stop sign under this paragraph, he shall give notice, in writing, of
that proposed action to the Municipality at least thirty days before installing
or removing the stop sign.
   (b)   Other streets or highways or portions thereof, are hereby designated
through streets or highways, if they are within the Municipality, if they have
a continuous length of more than one mile between the limits of such street or
highway or portion thereof, and if they have "stop" or "yield" signs or traffic
control signals at the entrances of the majority of intersecting streets or
highways.  For purposes of this section, the limits of such street or highway
or portion thereof, shall be a municipal corporation line, the physical
terminus of the street or highway or any point on such street or highway at
which vehicular traffic thereon is required by regulatory signs to stop or
yield to traffic on the intersecting street, provided that in residence
districts the Municipality may by ordinance designate such street or highway,
or portion thereof, not to be a through highway and thereafter the affected
residence district shall be indicated by official traffic control devices. 
Where two or more streets or highways designated under this subsection (b)
intersect and no traffic control signal is in operation, stop signs or yield
signs shall be erected at one or more entrances thereto by the Ohio Department
of Transportation or by Council or the authorized local authority, except as
otherwise provided in this section.
   (c)   Stop signs need not be erected at intersections so constructed as to
permit traffic to safely enter a through street or highway without coming to a
stop.  Signs shall be erected at such intersections indicating that the
operator of a vehicle shall yield the right of way to or merge with all traffic
proceeding on the through street or highway.
   (d)   Council or the authorized local authority may designate additional
through streets or highways and shall erect stop signs, yield signs or traffic
control signals at all streets and highways intersecting such through streets
or highways, or may designate any intersection as a stop or yield intersection
and shall erect like signs at one or more entrances to such intersection.

      (1)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular yellow signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter
the intersection to proceed straight through or turn right or left or make a u-
turn movement except as such movement is modified by lane-use signs, turn
prohibition signs, lane markings, roadway design, separate turn signal
indications, or other traffic control devices. Such vehicular traffic,
including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn movement, shall
yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (2)   A.   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing yellow arrow signal indication, displayed alone or in combination with
another signal indication, is permitted to cautiously enter the intersection
only to make the movement indicated by such arrow, or other such movement as is
permitted by other signal indications displayed at the same time. Such
vehicular traffic, including vehicles turning right or left or making a u-turn,
shall yield the right-of-way to both of the following:
            1.   Pedestrians lawfully within an associated crosswalk;
            2.   Other vehicles lawfully within the intersection.
         B.   In addition, vehicular traffic turning left or making a u-turn to
the left shall yield the right-of-way to other vehicles approaching from the
opposite direction so closely as to constitute an immediate hazard during the
time when such turning vehicle is moving across or within the intersection.
      (3)   Pedestrians facing any flashing yellow signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing yellow signal indication is first displayed.
      (4)   When a flashing circular yellow signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory or warning requirements of the other traffic
control device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently
applicable.
   (f)   Flashing Red Signal Indication.
      (1)   Vehicular traffic, on an approach to an intersection, facing a
flashing circular red signal indication, shall stop at a clearly marked stop
line; but if there is no stop line, before entering the crosswalk on the near
side of the intersection; or if there is no crosswalk, at the point nearest the
intersecting roadway where the driver has a view of approaching traffic on the
intersecting roadway before entering the intersection. The right to proceed
shall be subject to the provisions that are applicable after making a stop at a
stop sign.
      (2)   Pedestrians facing any flashing red signal indication at an
intersection, unless otherwise directed by a pedestrian signal indication or
other traffic control device, are permitted to proceed across the roadway
within any marked or unmarked associated crosswalk. Pedestrians shall yield the
right-of-way to vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the
flashing red signal indication is first displayed.
      (3)   When a flashing circular red signal indication is displayed as a
beacon to supplement another traffic control device, road users are notified
that there is a need to pay additional attention to the message contained
thereon or that the regulatory requirements of the other traffic control
device, which might not be applicable at all times, are currently applicable.
Use of this signal indication shall be limited to supplementing stop, do not
enter, or wrong way signs, and to applications where compliance with the
supplemented traffic control device requires a stop at a designated point.
   (g)   In the event an official traffic-control signal is erected and
maintained at a place other than an intersection, the provisions of this
section shall be applicable except as to those provisions which by their nature
can have no application. Any stop required shall be made at a sign or marking
on the pavement indicating where the stop shall be made, but in the absence of
any such sign or marking the stop shall be made at the signal.
   (h)   This section does not apply at railroad grade crossings. Conduct of
drivers of vehicles approaching railroad grade crossings shall be governed by
R.C. §§ 4511.61 and 4511.62.

which the signal indication is located because a lane control change is being
made to a steady red “X” signal indication.
   (c)   A Steady White Two-Way Left-Turn Arrow.  A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, but not
for through travel, with the understanding that common use of the lane by
oncoming road users for left turns also is permitted.
   (d)   A Steady White One-Way Left-Turn Arrow. A road user is permitted to
use a lane over which the signal indication is located for a left turn, without
opposing turns in the same lane, but not for through travel.
   (e)   A Steady Red “X”. A road user is not permitted to use the lane over
which the signal indication is located and that this signal indication shall
modify accordingly the meaning of other traffic controls present.

      (1)   A steady walking person signal indication, which symbolizes “walk”,
means that a pedestrian facing the signal indication is permitted to start to
cross the roadway in the direction of the signal indication, possibly in
conflict with turning vehicles. The pedestrian shall yield the right-of-way to
vehicles lawfully within the intersection at the time that the walking person
signal indication is first shown.
      (2)   A flashing upraised hand signal indication, which symbolizes “don't
walk”, means that a pedestrian shall not start to cross the roadway in the
direction of the signal indication, but that any pedestrian who has already
started to cross on a steady walking person signal indication shall proceed to
the far side of the traveled way of the street or highway, unless otherwise
directed by a traffic control device to proceed only to the median of a divided
highway or only to some other island or pedestrian refuge area.
      (3)   A steady upraised hand signal indication means that a pedestrian
shall not enter the roadway in the direction of the signal indication.
      (4)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to invalidate the
continued use of pedestrian control signals utilizing the word “wait” if those
signals were installed prior to March 28, 1985.

2317.02, may be admitted with expert testimony to be considered with any other
relevant and competent evidence in determining the guilt or innocence of the
defendant.
         B.   In any criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) or
(b) of this section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, the
court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of abuse,
controlled substances, metabolites of a controlled substance or a combination
of them in the defendant’s whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, urine or
other bodily substance at the time of the alleged violation as shown by
chemical analysis of the substance withdrawn within three hours of the time of
the alleged violation. The three-hour time limit specified in this division
regarding the admission of evidence does not extend or affect the two-hour time
limit specified in R.C. § 4511.192(A) as the maximum period of time during
which a person may consent to a chemical test or tests as described in that
section. The court may admit evidence on the concentration of alcohol, drugs of

withdrawn under this division (d)(1)B. shall be analyzed in accordance with
methods approved by the Director of Health by an individual possessing a valid
permit issued by the Director pursuant to R.C. § 3701.143.
         C.   As used in division (d)(1)B. of this section, “Emergency medical
technician- intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the
same meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
      (2)   In a criminal prosecution for a violation of division (a) of this
section or for an equivalent offense that is vehicle-related, if there was at
the time the bodily substance was withdrawn a concentration of less than the
applicable concentration of alcohol specified in divisions (a)(1)B., (a)(1)C.,
(a)(1)D. and (a)(1)E. of this section or less than the applicable concentration
of a listed controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled
substance specified for a violation of division (a)(1)J. of this section, that
fact may be considered with other competent evidence in determining the guilt
or innocence of the defendant. This division does not limit or affect a
criminal prosecution for a violation of division (b) of this section.
      (3)   Upon the request of the person who was tested, the results of the
chemical test shall be made available to the person or the person's attorney,
immediately upon the completion of the chemical test analysis. If the chemical
test was obtained pursuant to division (d)(1)B. of this section, the person
tested may have a physician, a registered nurse or a qualified technician,
chemist or phlebotomist of the person's own choosing administer a chemical test
or tests, at the person's expense, in addition to any administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer. If the person was under arrest as
described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the arresting officer shall advise the
person at the time of the arrest that the person may have an independent
chemical test taken at the person's own expense. If the person was under arrest
other than described in R.C. § 4511.191(A)(5), the form to be read to the
person to be tested, as required under division (g) of this section, shall
state that the person may have an independent test performed at the person's
expense. The failure or inability to obtain an additional chemical test by a

evidence is admissible under the Rules of Evidence, the court shall admit the
testimony or evidence and the trier of fact shall give it whatever weight the
trier of fact considers to be appropriate.
         C.   Division (d)(4)B. of this section does not limit or preclude a
court, in its determination of whether the arrest of a person was supported by
probable cause or its determination of any other matter in a criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding of a type described in that division,
from considering evidence or testimony that is not otherwise disallowed by
division (d)(4)B. of this section.
   (e)   Laboratory Report.
      (1)   Subject to division (e)(3) of this section, in any criminal
prosecution or juvenile court proceeding for a violation of division (a)(1)B.,

based upon a claim of assault and battery or any other claim that is not a
claim of malpractice, for any act performed in withdrawing blood from the
person. The immunity provided in this division also extends to an emergency
medical service organization that employs an emergency medical technician-
intermediate or emergency medical technician-paramedic who withdraws blood
under this section. The immunity provided in this division is not available to
a person who withdraws blood if the person engages in willful or wanton
misconduct.
      (2)   As used in division (f)(1), “Emergency medical technician-
intermediate” and “Emergency medical technician-paramedic” have the same
meanings as in R.C. § 4765.01.
(R.C. § 4511.19(A) - (F))
   (g)   Implied Consent.
      (1)   Definitions.  For the purpose of this division (g), the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.
         A.   "Alcohol monitoring device."  Any device that provides for
continuous alcohol monitoring, any ignition interlock device, any immobilizing
or disabling device other than an ignition interlock device that is constantly
available to monitor the concentration of alcohol in a person's system, or any
other device that provides for the automatic testing and periodic reporting of
alcohol consumption by a person and that a court orders a person to use as a
sanction imposed as a result of the person's conviction of or plea of guilty to
an offense.
         B.   “Community addiction services provider.”  Has the same meaning as
in R.C. § 5119.01.
         C.   “Physical control.” Has the same meaning as in R.C. § 4511.194.
      (2)   Implied consent to chemical tests. Any person who operates a
vehicle upon a highway or any public or private property used by the public for
vehicular travel or parking within this municipality or who is in physical
control of a vehicle shall be deemed to have given consent to a chemical test
or tests of the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine
to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a
controlled substance, or combination content of the person's whole blood, blood
serum or plasma, breath, or urine if arrested for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance.
      (3)   Tests at request of law enforcement agent.  The chemical test or
tests under division (g)(2) of this section shall be administered at the
request of a law enforcement officer having reasonable grounds to believe the
person was operating or in physical control of a vehicle in violation of a
division, section or ordinance identified in division (g)(2) of this section.
The law enforcement agency by which the officer is employed shall designate
which of the tests shall be administered.
      (4)   Effect of death or unconsciousness. Any person who is dead or
unconscious, or who otherwise is in a condition rendering the person incapable
of refusal, shall be deemed to have consented as provided in division (g)(2) of
this section and the test or tests may be administered, subject to R.C. §§
313.12 to 313.16.
      (5)   Chemical tests.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer arrests a person for a violation of
R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance and if the person if convicted would
be required to be sentenced under R.C. § 4511.19(G)(1)(c), (G)(1)(d) or (G)(1)
(e), the law enforcement officer shall request the person to submit, and the
person shall submit, to a chemical test or tests of the person’s whole blood,
blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine for the purpose of determining the
alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance, metabolite of a controlled
substance, or combination content of the person’s whole blood, blood serum or
plasma, breath, or urine. A law enforcement officer who makes a request
pursuant to this division that a person submit to a chemical test or tests is
not required to advise the person of the consequences of submitting to, or
refusing to submit to, the test or tests and is not required to give the person
the form described in division (g)(7) of this section, but the officer shall
advise the person at the time of the arrest that if the person refuses to take
a chemical test the officer may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary
to ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole
blood or blood serum or plasma. The officer shall also advise the person at the
time of the arrest that the person may have an independent chemical test taken
at the person’s own expense. Divisions (g)(3) and (g)(4) of this section apply
to the administration of a chemical test or tests pursuant to this division.
         B.   If a person refuses to submit to a chemical test upon a request
made pursuant to division (g)(5)A. of this section, the law enforcement officer
who made the request may employ whatever reasonable means are necessary to
ensure that the person submits to a chemical test of the person's whole blood
or blood serum or plasma. A law enforcement officer who acts pursuant to this
division to ensure that a person submits to a chemical test of the person's
whole blood or blood serum or plasma is immune from criminal and civil
liability based upon a claim for assault and battery or any other claim for the
acts, unless the officer so acted with malicious purpose, in bad faith, or in a
wanton or reckless manner.
(R.C. § 4511.191(A))
      (6)   Advice required.  Except as provided in division (g)(5) of this
section, the arresting law enforcement officer shall give advice in accordance
with this division to any person under arrest for a violation of division (a),
(b) or (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other municipal O.V.I.
ordinance. The officer shall give that advice in a written form that contains
the information described in division (g)(7) of this section and shall read the
advice to the person. The form shall contain a statement that the form was
shown to the person under arrest and read to the person by the arresting
officer. One or more persons shall witness the arresting officer’s reading of
the form, and the witnesses shall certify to this fact by signing the form. The
person must submit to the chemical test or tests, subsequent to the request of
the arresting officer, within two hours of the time of the alleged violation
and, if the person does not submit to the test or tests within that two-hour
time limit, the failure to submit automatically constitutes a refusal to submit
to the test or tests.
      (7)   Certification of arrest. Except as provided in division (g)(5) of
this section, if a person is under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of
this section, before the person may be requested to submit to a chemical test
or tests to determine the alcohol, drug of abuse, controlled substance,
metabolite of a controlled substance or combination content of the person's
whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine, the arresting officer
shall read the following form to the person:
"You now are under arrest for (specifically state the offense under state law
or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance for which the person was
arrested – operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol, a drug, or a
combination of them; operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance;
operating a vehicle after underage alcohol consumption; or having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence).
"If you refuse to take any chemical test required by law, your Ohio driving
privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay a fee to
have the privileges reinstated. If you have a prior conviction of O.V.I.,
O.V.U.A.C., or operating a vehicle while under the influence of a listed
controlled substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance under
state or municipal law within the preceding 20 years, you are now under arrest
for state O.V.I., and, if you refuse to take a chemical test, you will face
increased penalties if you subsequently are convicted of the state O.V.I.
(Read this part unless the person is under arrest for solely having physical
control of a vehicle while under the influence.) "If you take any chemical test
required by law and are found to be at or over the prohibited amount of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
your whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine as set by law, your
Ohio driving privileges will be suspended immediately, and you will have to pay
a fee to have the privileges reinstated.
"If you take a chemical test, you may have an independent chemical test taken
at your own expense."
      (8)   Actions required by arresting officer. If the arresting law
enforcement officer does not ask a person under arrest as described in division
(g)(5) of this section or division (g)(6) of this section to submit to a
chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this section, the arresting
officer shall seize the Ohio or out-of-state driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit of the person and immediately forward it to the court in
which the arrested person is to appear on the charge. If the arrested person is
not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the arrest,
and, upon the surrender, the agency immediately shall forward the license or
permit to the court in which the person is to appear on the charge. Upon
receipt of the license or permit, the court shall retain it pending the
arrested person's initial appearance and any action taken under R.C. §
4511.196.
      (9)   Duties of officer.
         A.   If a law enforcement officer asks a person under arrest as
described in division (g)(5) of this section to submit to a chemical test or
tests under that division and the test results indicate a prohibited
concentration of alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a
controlled substance in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma,
breath, or urine at the time of the alleged offense, or if a law enforcement
officer asks a person under arrest as described in division (g)(6) of this
section to submit to a chemical test or tests under R.C. § 4511.191 or this
section, if the officer advises the person in accordance with this section of
the consequences of the person's refusal or submission, and if either the
person refuses to submit to the test or tests or, unless the arrest was for a
violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, the person submits to the test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense, the arresting officer shall do all of the following:
            1.   On behalf of the Registrar of Motor Vehicles, notify the
person that, independent of any penalties or sanctions imposed upon the person,
the person's Ohio driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or
nonresident operating privilege is suspended immediately, that the suspension
will last at least until the person's initial appearance on the charge, which
will be held within five days after the date of the person's arrest or the
issuance of a citation to the person, and that the person may appeal the
suspension at the initial appearance or during the period of time ending 30
days after that initial appearance;
            2.   Seize the driver's or commercial driver's license or permit of
the person and immediately forward it to the Registrar. If the arrested person
is not in possession of the person's license or permit or it is not in the
person's vehicle, the officer shall order the person to surrender it to the law
enforcement agency that employs the officer within 24 hours after the person is
given notice of the suspension, and, upon the surrender, the officer's
employing agency immediately shall forward the license or permit to the
Registrar;
            3.   Verify the person's current residence and, if it differs from
that on the person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit, notify
the Registrar of the change;
            4.   Send to the Registrar, within 48 hours after the arrest of the
person, a sworn report that includes all of the following statements:
               a.   That the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that, at
the time of the arrest, the arrested person was operating a vehicle in
violation of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B) or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance or for
being in physical control of a stationary vehicle in violation of R.C. §
4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance;
               b.   That the person was arrested and charged with a violation
of R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B), 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, or a municipal O.V.I. ordinance;
               c.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
the officer asked the person to take the designated chemical test or tests,
advised the person in accordance with this section of the consequences of
submitting to, or refusing to take, the test or tests, and gave the person the
form described in division (g)(7) of this section;
               d.   Unless division (g)(9)A.4.e. of this section applies, that
either the person refused to submit to the chemical test or tests or, unless
the arrest was for a violation of R.C. § 4511.194 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, the person submitted to the chemical test or tests and the
test results indicate a prohibited concentration of alcohol, a controlled
substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's whole
blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine at the time of the alleged
offense;
               e.   If the person was under arrest as described in division (g)
(5) of this section and the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance
with that division, that the person was under arrest as described in that
division, that the chemical test or tests were performed in accordance with
that division, and that test results indicated a prohibited concentration of
alcohol, a controlled substance, or a metabolite of a controlled substance in
the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath, or urine at the time
of the alleged offense.
         B.   Division (g)(9)A. of this section does not apply to a person who
is arrested for a violation of division (o) of this section, R.C. § 4511.194 or
a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, or any other substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance, who is asked by a law enforcement officer to
submit to a chemical test or tests under this section, and who submits to the
test or tests, regardless of the amount of alcohol, a controlled substance, or
a metabolite of a controlled substance that the test results indicate is
present in the person's whole blood, blood serum or plasma, breath or urine.
      (10)   Sworn report of arresting officer.
         A.   The arresting officer shall give the officer's sworn report that
is completed under this section to the arrested person at the time of the
arrest, or the Registrar of Motor Vehicles shall send the report to the person
by regular first-class mail as soon as possible after receipt of the report,
but not later than 14 days after receipt of it. An arresting officer may give
an unsworn report to the arrested person at the time of the arrest, provided
the report is complete when given to the arrested person and subsequently is
sworn to by the arresting officer. As soon as possible, but not later than 48
hours after the arrest of the person, the arresting officer shall send a copy
of the sworn report to the court in which the arrested person is to appear on
the charge for which the person was arrested.
         B.   The sworn report of an arresting officer completed under this
section is prima facie proof of the information and statements that it
contains. It shall be admitted and considered as prima facie proof of the
information and statements that it contains in any appeal under R.C. § 4511.197
relative to any suspension of a person's driver's or commercial driver's
license or permit or nonresident operating privilege that results from the
arrest covered by the report.
(R.C. § 4511.192)
      (11)   Suspension effective immediately. A suspension of a person's
driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident operating
privilege under this section for the time described in R.C. § 4511.191(B) or
(C) is effective immediately from the time at which the arresting officer
serves the notice of suspension upon the arrested person. Any subsequent
finding that the person is not guilty of the charge that resulted in the
person's being requested to take the chemical test or tests under division (g)
(1) through (g)(5) of this section does not affect the suspension.
      (12)   Initial appearance. If a person arrested for operating a vehicle
in violation of division (a) or (b) of this section, R.C. § 4511.19(A) or (B),
or any other municipal O.V.I. ordinance, or for being in physical control of a
vehicle in violation of division (o) of this section or R.C. § 4511.194 or a
substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, regardless of whether the
person's driver's or commercial driver's license or permit or nonresident
operating privilege is or is not suspended under R.C. § 4511.191(B) or (C) or
R.C. Chapter 4510, the person's initial appearance on the charge resulting from
the arrest shall be held within five days of the person's arrest or the
issuance of the citation to him or her, subject to any continuance granted by
the court pursuant to R.C. § 4511.197 regarding the issues specified in that
section.

within 60 days of sentencing of the offender, the court issues a written
finding on the record that, due to the unavailability of space at the jail
where the offender is required to serve the term, the offender will not be able
to begin serving that term within the 60-day period following the date of
sentencing, the court may impose an alternative sentence as specified in R.C. §
4511.19(G)(3) that includes a term of house arrest with electronic monitoring,

the National Automobile Dealers Association. The proceeds of any fine so
imposed shall be distributed in accordance with division (C)(2) of that
section.
      (7)   In all cases in which an offender is sentenced under division (h)

nonresident operating privilege is suspended under this section or R.C. §
4511.19 files an appeal regarding any aspect of the person's trial or sentence,
the appeal itself does not stay the operation of the suspension.

operates a vehicle while the person has a concentration of a listed controlled
substance or a listed metabolite of a controlled substance in the person's

or, in a case involving the operation of a motorcycle by the offender, the
offender’s driver’s or commercial driver’s license bearing the motorcycle
endorsement or the offender’s restricted license was expired at the time of the
offense, except as otherwise provided in this division, the offense is a minor
misdemeanor. If within three years of the offense, the offender previously has
been convicted of or pleaded guilty to two or more violations of this section

any recommendations of the physician or chiropractor as noted on the affidavit.
   (i)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to require any person to
carry with the person the birth certificate of a child to prove the age of the

section shall be punished as follows, provided that the failure of an operator
of a motor vehicle to secure more than one child in a child restraint system,

section, the offender is guilty of a minor misdemeanor and shall be fined not
less than twenty-five dollars ($25.00) nor more than seventy-five dollars

action as evidence of negligence or contributory negligence.  But the trier of
fact may determine based on evidence admitted consistent with the Ohio rules of
evidence that the failure contributed to the harm alleged in the tort action
and may diminish a recovery of compensatory damages that represents noneconomic
loss, as defined in Ohio R.C. 2307.011 in a tort action that could have been
recovered but for the plaintiff's failure to wear all of the available elements
of a properly adjusted occupant restraining device.  Evidence of that failure
shall not be used as a basis for a criminal prosecution of the person other

with occupant restraining devices, any occupant of the passenger car who
sustained injury or death was not wearing an available occupant restraining
device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a device, or was
not wearing such a device as properly adjusted, then, consistent with the Rules
of Evidence, the fact that the occupant was not wearing the available occupant
restraining device, was not wearing all of the available elements of such a
device, or was not wearing such a device as properly adjusted is admissible in
evidence in relation to any claim for relief in a tort action to the extent

section is guilty of a misdemeanor of the third degree.

be in the form that the municipality prescribes. The municipality may prescribe
a permit fee to be imposed and collected when any permit described in this
section is issued. The permit fee may be in an amount sufficient to reimburse
the municipality for the administrative costs incurred in issuing the permit,
and also to cover the cost of normal and expected damage caused to the roadway
or a street or highway structure as the result of the operation of the
nonconforming vehicle or combination of vehicles.
         B.   For the purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the
Director under R.C. § 4513.34, milk transported in bulk by vehicle is deemed a
nondivisible load.
         C.   For purposes of this section and of rules adopted by the Director
under R.C. § 4513.34, three or fewer aluminum coils, transported by a vehicle,
are deemed a nondivisible load. The Director shall adopt rules establishing
requirements for an aluminum coil permit that are substantially similar to the
requirements for a steel coil permit under O.A.C. Chapter 5501:2-1.
      (4)   The municipality shall issue a special regional heavy hauling
permit under division (a)(1)A. of this section upon application and payment of
the applicable fee. However, the municipality may issue or withhold a special
permit specified in division (a)(1)B. of this section. If a permit is to be
issued, the municipality may limit or prescribe conditions of operation for the
vehicle and may require the posting of a bond or other security conditioned
upon the sufficiency of the permit fee to compensate for damage caused to the
roadway or a street or highway structure. In addition, the municipality, as a
condition of issuance of an overweight permit, may require the applicant to
develop and enter into a mutual agreement with the municipality to compensate
for or to repair excess damage caused to the roadway by travel under the
permit.
      (5)   Every permit issued under this section shall be carried in the
vehicle or combination of vehicles to which it refers and shall be open to
inspection by any police officer or authorized agent of any authority granting
the permit. No person shall violate any of the terms of a permit.
      (6)   The Director of Transportation may debar an applicant from applying
for a special permit under this section upon a finding based on a reasonable
belief that the applicant has done any of the actions specified in R.C. §
4513.34(F).
      (7)   Notice and procedures for debarment shall be as provided in R.C. §
4513.34(G).

section that relate to an approved route except upon order of a law enforcement
officer or authorized agent of the issuing authority.
      (9)   A permit issued by the municipality under this section for the
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles is valid for the purposes of
the vehicle operation in accordance with the conditions and limitations
specified on the permit. Such a permit is voidable by law enforcement only for
operation of a vehicle or combination of vehicles in violation of the weight,
dimension, or route provisions of the permit. However, a permit is not voidable
for operation in violation of a route provision of a permit if the operation is
upon the order of a law enforcement officer.

peace, property, health and safety. The Police Chief and the City Manager may
require the posting of bond or other security necessary to compensate for any
damage to a roadway or road structure.
      (4)    For each such permit, the Police Chief and the City Manager shall
charge five dollars ($5.00) and for each hour of time or any part thereof spent
by each police officer in supervising the movement of such vehicle the
applicant shall pay the sum of ten dollars ($10.00).
      (5)    Signs shall be posted indicating "No Through Trucks-Gross Weight 5
Tons" or words of similar import to apprise drivers of the limitations imposed
by this section. No driver shall disobey the instructions indicated on any such
sign.
      (6)    Violation of any of the limitations, terms or conditions of the

which offense is an offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this
State and the other jurisdiction, or, while in this Municipality, the person
conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction, which offense is an
offense under both the laws of this Municipality or this State and the other
jurisdiction, and a substantial overt act in furtherance of the conspiracy is
undertaken in this Municipality by the person or another person involved in the
conspiracy, subsequent to the person's entrance into the conspiracy.  In any
case in which a person attempts to commit, is guilty of complicity in the
commission of, or conspires to commit an offense in another jurisdiction as

commit, or is guilty of complicity in the commission of, an offense in this
Municipality.
      (4)   While out of this Municipality, the person omits to perform a legal

   (b)   This Municipality includes the land and water within its boundaries
and the air space above such land and water, and real property outside the
corporate limits, with respect to which this Municipality has either exclusive
or concurrent legislative jurisdiction.  Where the boundary between this
Municipality and another jurisdiction is disputed, the disputed territory is
conclusively presumed to be within this Municipality for purposes of this
section.
   (c)   When an offense is committed under the laws of this Municipality, and
it appears beyond a reasonable doubt that the offense or any element of the
offense took place either in this Municipality or in another jurisdiction or
jurisdictions, but it cannot reasonably be determined in which it took place,
the offense or element is conclusively presumed to have taken place in this
Municipality for purposes of this section.
   (d)   When a person is subject to criminal prosecution and punishment in
this Municipality for an offense committed or completed outside of this
Municipality, the person is subject to all specifications for that offense that

under this section to criminal prosecution and punishment in this Municipality
need not be committed personally by the person as long as it is committed by
another person who is in complicity or conspiracy with the person.
   (f)   This section shall be liberally construed, consistent with
constitutional limitations, to allow this Municipality the broadest possible
jurisdiction over offenses and persons committing offenses in, or affecting,
this Municipality.
   (g)   For purposes of subsection (a)(2) of this section, an overt act is
substantial when it is of a character that manifests a purpose on the part of

   (h)   As used in this section, "computer", "computer system", "computer
network", "information service", "telecommunication", "telecommunications
device", "telecommunications service", "data", and "writing" have the same
meaning as in Ohio R.C. 2913.01.

         B.   For an offense by a person who is not a public servant but whose
offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a public servant, at
any time while that public servant remains a public servant, or within two
years thereafter.
      (2)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
         A.   “Offense is directly related to the misconduct in office of a
public servant.” The phrase includes but is not limited to a violation of R.C.
§ 101.71, 101.91, 121.61 or 2921.13, 102.03(F) or (H), 2921.02(A), 2921.43(A)
or (B), or 3517.13(F) or (G), that is directly related to an offense involving
misconduct in office of a public servant, or a violation of any municipal
ordinance substantially equivalent to those Ohio Revised Code sections listed
in this division (c)(2)A.
         B.   “Public servant” has the same meaning as in R.C. § 2921.01.
   (d)   (1)   If a DNA record made in connection with the criminal
investigation of the commission of a violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 is
determined to match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if
the time of the determination is later than 25 years after the offense is

match another DNA record that is of an identifiable person and if the time of
the determination is within 25 years after the offense is committed,
prosecution of that person for a violation of the section may be commenced
within the longer of 25 years after the offense is committed or five years
after the determination is complete.
      (3)   As used in this division, “DNA record” has the same meaning as in
R.C. § 109.573.
   (e)   An offense is committed when every element of the offense occurs. In
the case of an offense of which an element is a continuing course of conduct,
the period of limitation does not begin to run until the course of conduct or
the accused’s accountability for it terminates, whichever occurs first.
   (f)   A prosecution is commenced on the date an indictment is returned or an
information filed, or on the date a lawful arrest without a warrant is made, or
on the date a warrant, summons, citation or other process is issued, whichever
occurs first. A prosecution is not commenced by the return of an indictment or
the filing of an information unless reasonable diligence is exercised to issue
and execute process on the same. A prosecution is not commenced upon issuance
of a warrant, summons, citation or other process unless reasonable diligence is
exercised to execute the same.
   (g)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the corpus
delicti remains undiscovered.
   (h)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time when the
accused purposely avoids prosecution. Proof that the accused departed this
municipality or conceals the accused’s identity or whereabouts is prima facie
evidence of the accused’s purpose to avoid prosecution.
   (i)   The period of limitation shall not run during any time a prosecution
against the accused based on the same conduct is pending in this state, even
though the indictment, information or process that commenced the prosecution is
quashed or the proceedings on the indictment, information or process are set
aside or reversed on appeal.
   (j)   (1)   “Property” means any property, real or personal, tangible or
intangible, and any interest or license in that property.  “Property” includes,
but is not limited to, cable television service, other telecommunications
service, telecommunications devices, information service, computers, data,
computer software, financial instruments associated with computers, other
documents associated with computers, or copies of the documents, whether in
machine or human readable form, trade secrets, trademarks, copyrights, patents,
and property protected by a trademark, copyright, or patent.  “Financial
instruments associated with computers” include, but are not limited to, checks,
drafts, warrants, money orders, notes of indebtedness, certificates of deposit,
letters of credit, bills of credit or debit cards, financial transaction
authorization mechanisms, marketable securities, or any computer system
representations of any of them.
      (1)   The victim of the offense reaches the age of majority.
      (2)   A public children services agency, or a municipal or county peace
officer that is not the parent or guardian of the child, in the county in which
the child resides or in which the abuse or neglect is occurring or has occurred
has been notified that abuse or neglect is known, suspected or believed to have

violation of R.C. § 2907.02 or 2907.03 committed on and after July 16, 2015 and
apply to a violation of either of those sections committed prior to July 16,
2015 if prosecution for that violation was not barred under this section as it
existed on July 15, 2015.
(R.C. § 2901.13)
   (m)   This section shall not apply to prosecutions commenced within the
period of limitations set forth in Ohio R.C. 718.12(B) for violations of the
Municipal income tax ordinance.
501.07  REQUIREMENTS FOR CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   Except as provided in subsection (b) hereof, a person is not guilty of
an offense unless both of the following apply:
      (1)   The person's liability is based on conduct that includes either a
voluntary act, or an omission to perform an act or duty that the person is
capable of performing;
      (2)   The person has the requisite degree of culpability for each element
as to which a culpable mental state is specified by the language defining the
offense.
   (b)   When the language defining an offense does not specify any degree of
culpability, and plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict criminal
liability for the conduct described in the section, then culpability is not
required for a person to be guilty of the offense. The fact that one division
of a section plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict liability for an
offense defined in that division does not by itself plainly indicate a purpose
to impose strict criminal liability for an offense defined in other divisions
of the section that do not specify a degree of culpability.
   (c)   (1)   When language defining an element of an offense that is related
to knowledge or intent or to which mens rea could fairly be applied neither
specifies culpability nor plainly indicates a purpose to impose strict
liability, the element of the offense is established only if a person acts
recklessly.
      (2)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not apply to offenses defined
in Ohio R.C. Title XLV.
      (3)   Division (c)(1) of this section does not relieve the prosecution of
the burden of proving the culpable mental state required by any definition
incorporated into the offense.
   (d)   Voluntary intoxication may not be taken into consideration in
determining the existence of a mental state that is an element of a criminal
offense.  Voluntary intoxication does not relieve a person of a duty to act if
failure to act constitutes a criminal offense.  Evidence that a person was
voluntarily intoxicated may be admissible to show whether or not the person was
physically capable of performing the act with which the person is charged.
   (e)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.
      (1)   “Culpability.” Purpose, knowledge, recklessness or negligence, as
defined in Ohio R.C. 2901.22.
      (2)   “Intoxication.” Includes but is not limited to intoxication
resulting from the ingestion of alcohol, a drug, or alcohol and a drug.
      (3)   “Involuntary acts.” Reflexes, convulsions, body movements during
unconsciousness or sleep, and body movements that are not otherwise a product
of the actor’s volition are “involuntary acts.”
      (4)   “Possession.” A voluntary act if the possessor knowingly procured
or received the thing possessed, or was aware of the possessor’s control of the
thing possessed for a sufficient time to have ended possession.
(ORC 2901.21)
501.08  CULPABLE MENTAL STATES.
   (a)   A person acts purposely when it is the person’s specific intention to
cause a certain result, or when the gist of the offense is a prohibition
against conduct of a certain nature, regardless of what the offender intends to
accomplish thereby, it is the offender’s specific intention to engage in
conduct of that nature.
   (b)   A person acts knowingly, regardless of purpose, when the person is
aware that the person’s conduct will probably cause a certain result or will
probably be of a certain nature. A person has knowledge of circumstances when
the person is aware that such circumstances probably exist. When knowledge of
the existence of a particular fact is an element of an offense, such knowledge
is established if a person subjectively believes that there is a high
probability of its existence and fails to make inquiry or acts with a conscious
purpose to avoid learning the fact.
   (c)   A person acts recklessly when, with heedless indifference to the
consequences, the person disregards a substantial and unjustifiable risk that
the person’s conduct is likely to cause a certain result or is likely to be of
a certain nature. A person is reckless with respect to circumstances when, with
heedless indifference to the consequences, the person disregards a substantial
and unjustifiable risk that such circumstances are likely to exist.
   (d)   A person acts negligently when, because of a substantial lapse from
due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that the person’s
conduct may cause a certain result or may be of a certain nature.  A person is
negligent with respect to circumstances when, because of a substantial lapse
from due care, the person fails to perceive or avoid a risk that such
circumstances may exist.
   (e)   When the section defining an offense provides that negligence suffices
to establish an element thereof, then recklessness, knowledge or purpose is
also sufficient culpability for such element.  When recklessness suffices to
establish an element of an offense, then knowledge or purpose is also
sufficient culpability for such element.  When knowledge suffices to establish
an element of an offense, then purpose is also sufficient culpability for such
element.
(ORC 2901.22)
501.09  ATTEMPT.
   (a)   No person, purposely or knowingly, and when purpose or knowledge is
sufficient culpability for the commission of an offense, shall engage in
conduct that, if successful, would constitute or result in the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that, in retrospect,
commission of the offense that was the object of the attempt was either
factually or legally impossible under the attendant circumstances, if that
offense could have been committed had the attendant circumstances been as the
actor believed them to be.
   (c)   No person who is convicted of committing a specific offense or of
complicity in the commission of an offense, shall be convicted of an attempt to
commit the same offense in violation of this section.
   (d)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that the
actor abandoned the actor's effort to commit the offense or otherwise prevented
its commission, under circumstances manifesting a complete and voluntary
renunciation of the actor's criminal purpose.
   (e)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of an attempt to commit an
offense. An attempt to commit aggravated murder, murder or an offense for which
the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life is a felony of the first degree,
to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to commit a drug abuse
offense for which the penalty is determined by the amount or number of unit
doses of the controlled substance involved in the drug abuse offense is an
offense of the same degree as the drug abuse offense attempted would be if that
drug abuse offense had been committed and had involved an amount or number of
unit doses of the controlled substance that is within the next lower range of
controlled substance amounts than was involved in the attempt. An attempt to
commit any other offense is an offense of the next lesser degree than the
offense attempted. In the case of an attempt to commit an offense other than a
violation of R.C. Chapter 3734 that is not specifically classified, an attempt
is a misdemeanor of the first degree if the offense attempted is a felony, and
a misdemeanor of the fourth degree if the offense attempted is a misdemeanor.
In the case of an attempt to commit a violation of any provision of R.C.
Chapter 3734, other than R.C. § 3734.18, that relates to hazardous wastes, an
attempt is a felony to be prosecuted under appropriate state law. An attempt to
commit a minor misdemeanor, or to engage in conspiracy, is not an offense under
this section.
   (f)   As used in this section, “drug abuse offense” has the same meaning as
in Ohio R.C. 2925.01.
(R.C. § 2923.02)
501.10  COMPLICITY.
   (a)   No person, acting with the kind of culpability required for the
commission of an offense, shall do any of the following:
      (1)   Solicit or procure another to commit the offense;
      (2)   Aid or abet another in committing the offense;
      (3)   Cause an innocent or irresponsible person to commit the offense.
   (b)   It is no defense to a charge under this section that no person with
whom the accused was in complicity has been convicted as a principal offender.
   (c)   No person shall be convicted of complicity under this section unless
an offense is actually committed, but a person may be convicted of complicity
in an attempt to commit an offense in violation of Section
501.09.
   (d)   If an alleged accomplice of the defendant testifies against the
defendant in a case in which the defendant is charged with complicity in the
commission of or an attempt to commit an offense, an attempt to commit an
offense or an offense, the court when it charges the jury, shall state
substantially the following:
      "The testimony of an accomplice does not become
      inadmissible because of his complicity, moral turpitude
      or self-interest, but the admitted or claimed complicity
      of a witness may affect his credibility and make his
      testimony subject to grave suspicion, and require that
      it be weighed with great caution.
"It is for you, as jurors, in the light of all the facts presented to you from
the witness stand, to evaluate such testimony and to determine its quality and
worth or its lack of quality and worth."
   (e)   It is an affirmative defense to a charge under this section that,
prior to the commission of or attempt to commit the offense, the actor
terminated his complicity, under circumstances manifesting a complete and
voluntary renunciation of his criminal purpose.
   (f)   Whoever violates this section is guilty of complicity in the
commission of an offense, and shall be prosecuted and punished as if he were a
principal offender.  A charge of complicity may be stated in terms of this
section, or in terms of the principal offense.
(ORC 2923.03)
501.11  ORGANIZATIONAL CRIMINAL LIABILITY.
   (a)   An organization may be convicted of an offense under any of the
following circumstances:
      (1)   The offense is a minor misdemeanor committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (2)   A purpose to impose organizational liability plainly appears in the
section defining the offense, and the offense is committed by an officer, agent
or employee of the organization acting in its behalf and within the scope of
the officer’s, agent’s, or employee’s office or employment, except that if the
section defining the offense designates the officers, agents or employees for
whose conduct the organization is accountable or the circumstances under which
it is accountable, those provisions shall apply.
      (3)   The offense consists of an omission to discharge a specific duty
imposed by law on the organization.
      (4)   If, acting with the kind of culpability otherwise required for the
commission of the offense, its commission was authorized, requested, commanded,
tolerated or performed by the board of directors, trustees, partners or by a
high managerial officer, agent or employee acting in behalf of the organization
and within the scope of such a board’s or person’s office or employment.
   (b)   If strict liability is imposed for the commission of an offense, a
purpose to impose organizational liability shall be presumed, unless the
contrary plainly appears.
   (c)   In a prosecution of an organization for an offense other than one for
which strict liability is imposed, it is a defense that the high managerial
officer, agent or employee having supervisory responsibility over the subject
matter of the offense exercised due diligence to prevent its commission.  This
defense is not available if it plainly appears inconsistent with the purpose of
the section defining the offense.
   (d)   As used in this section, “organization” means a corporation for profit
or not for profit, partnership, limited partnership, joint venture,
unincorporated nonprofit association, estate, trust or other commercial or
legal entity.  “Organization” does not include an entity organized as or by a
governmental agency for the execution of a governmental program. 
(ORC 2901.23)
501.12  PERSONAL ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONAL CONDUCT.
   (a)   An officer, agent or employee of an organization as defined in Section
501.11 may be prosecuted for an offense committed by such organization, if he
acts with the kind of culpability required for the commission of the offense,
and any of the following apply:
      (1)   In the name of the organization or in its behalf, he engages in
conduct constituting the offense, or causes another to engage in such conduct,
or tolerates such conduct when it is of a type for which he has direct
responsibility;
      (2)   He has primary responsibility to discharge a duty imposed on the
organization by law, and such duty is not discharged.
   (b)   When a person is convicted of an offense by reason of this section, he
is subject to the same penalty as if he had acted in his own behalf.
(ORC 2901.24)
501.13  DISPOSITION OF PROPERTY.
   (a)   Any property, other than contraband that is subject to the provisions
of Ohio R.C. 2933.43 and other than property that has been lawfully seized in
relation to a violation of Ohio R.C. 2933.42, that has been lost, abandoned,
stolen, seized pursuant to a search warrant, or otherwise lawfully seized or
forfeited, and that is in the custody of a law enforcement agency, shall be
kept safely pending the time it no longer is needed as evidence, and shall be
disposed of pursuant to this section.  Every law enforcement agency  that has
any such lost, abandoned, stolen, seized or forfeited property in its custody,
except for property to be disposed of under subsection (d)(4) hereof, shall
maintain an accurate record of each item of the property. The record shall
include the date on which each item of property came into the agency's custody,
the manner in which it was disposed of, the date of its disposition and the
name of the person who received the property if it was not destroyed. The
record of any property that is no longer needed as evidence shall be open to
public inspection during the agency's regular business hours.
   (b)    A law enforcement agency that has property in its possession that is
required to be disposed of pursuant to this section shall make a reasonable
effort to locate the persons entitled to possession of the property in its
custody, to notify them of when and where it may be claimed and to return the
property to them at the earliest possible time. In the absence of evidence
identifying persons entitled to custody, it is sufficient notice to advertise
in a newspaper of general circulation in the County, briefly describing the
nature of the property in custody, and inviting persons to view and establish
their right to it.
   (c)    A person loses any right he may have to the possession of property if
either of the following apply:
      (1)    The property was the subject, or was used in a conspiracy or
attempt to commit, or in the commission, of an offense other than a traffic
offense, and such person is a conspirator, accomplice or offender with respect
to the offense;
      (2)    When a court determines that the property should be forfeited
because, in light of the nature of the property or the circumstances of such
person, it is unlawful for the person to acquire or possess the property.
   (d)    Unclaimed or forfeited property in the custody of a law enforcement
agency other than contraband that is subject to the provisions of Ohio R.C.
2933.43 and other than property that has been lawfully seized in relation to a
violation of Ohio R.C. 2923.42, shall be disposed of on application to and
order of any court of record that has territorial jurisdiction over the
Municipality as follows:
      (1)    Drugs shall be disposed of pursuant to Ohio R.C. 3719.11 or placed
in the custody of the Secretary of the Treasury of the United States for
disposal or use for medical or scientific purposes under applicable Federal
law.
      (2)    Firearms and dangerous ordnance suitable for police work may be
given to a law enforcement agency for that purpose. Firearms suitable for
sporting use, or as museum pieces or collectors' items, may be sold at public

ordnance shall be destroyed.
      (3)    Obscene material shall be destroyed.
      (4)   Beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol seized from a person who is
not the holder of a permit issued under Ohio R.C. Chapters 4301 and 4303, or is
an offender, and forfeited to the State under Ohio R.C. 4301.45 or 4301.53
shall be sold by the Department of Liquor Control, if the Department determines
that the beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol is fit for sale. If any tax
imposed under Ohio R.C. Title XLIII has not been paid in relation to the beer,
intoxicating liquor or alcohol, the proceeds of the sale shall first be used to
pay the tax. All other money collected under subsection (d)(4) hereof shall be
paid into the State Treasury. Any such beer, intoxicating liquor or alcohol
that the Department determines to be unfit for sale shall be destroyed.
      (5)   Money received by an inmate of a correctiona1 institution from an
unauthorized source or in an unauthorized manner shall be returned to the
sender, if known, or deposited in the inmates' industrial and entertainment
fund if the sender is not known.
      (6)   Vehicle and vehicle parts forfeited under Ohio R.C. 4549.61 to
4549.63 may be given to a law enforcement agency for use in the performance of
its duties. Such parts may be incorporated into any other official vehicle.
Parts that do not bear vehicle identification numbers or derivatives thereof
may be sold or disposed of as provided by rules of the Director of Highway

      (7)    A.   Computers, computer networks, computer systems and computer
software suitable for police work may be given to a law enforcement agency for
that purpose, other computers, computer networks, computer systems and computer
software shall be disposed of pursuant to subsection (d)(8) hereof.
         B.    As used in this section "computers," "computer networks,"

R.C. 2913.01.
      (8)   Other unclaimed or forfeited property, with the approval of the
court, may be used by the law enforcement agency that has possession of it. If
the other unclaimed or forfeited property is not used by the law enforcement

501.99  PENALTIES FOR MISDEMEANORS.
   (a)   Considerations in Misdemeanor Sentencing.
      (1)   A court that sentences an offender for a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of any provision of the Ohio Revised Code, or of any
municipal ordinance that is substantially equivalent to a misdemeanor or minor
misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised Code, shall be guided
by the overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing. The overriding purposes
of misdemeanor sentencing are to protect the public from future crime by the
offender and others and to punish the offender. To achieve those purposes, the
sentencing court shall consider the impact of the offense upon the victim and
the need for changing the offender's behavior, rehabilitating the defender, and
making restitution to the victim of the offense, the public, or the victim and
the public.
      (2)   A sentence imposed for a misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation
of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a violation of a municipal ordinance
that is subject to division (a)(1) of this section shall be reasonably
calculated to achieve the two overriding purposes of misdemeanor sentencing set
forth in division (a)(1) of this section, commensurate with and not demeaning
to the seriousness of the offender's conduct and its impact upon the victim,
and consistent with sentences imposed for similar offenses committed by similar
offenders.
      (3)   A court that imposes a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor
or minor misdemeanor violation of an Ohio Revised Code provision or for a
violation of a municipal ordinance that is subject to division (a)(1) of this
section shall not base the sentence upon the race, ethnic background, gender,
or religion of the offender.
      (4)   Divisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section shall not apply to any
offense that is disposed of by a traffic violations bureau of any court
pursuant to Traffic Rule 13 and shall not apply to any violation of any
provision of the Ohio Revised Code that is a minor misdemeanor and that is
disposed of without a court appearance. Divisions (a)(1) to (a)(3) of this
section do not affect any penalties established by the Municipality for a
violation of its ordinances that are not substantially equivalent to a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor violation of a provision of the Ohio Revised
Code.
(ORC 2929.21)
   (b)   Misdemeanor Jail Terms.
      (1)   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 or 2929.23 or division (b)
(5) or (b)(6) of this section and unless another term is required or authorized
pursuant to law, if the sentencing court imposing a sentence upon an offender
for a misdemeanor elects or is required to impose a jail term on the offender
pursuant to this chapter, the court shall impose a definite jail term that
shall be one of the following:
         A.   For a misdemeanor of the first degree, not more than 180 days;
         B.   For a misdemeanor of the second degree, not more than 90 days;
         C.   For a misdemeanor of the third degree, not more than 60 days;
         D.   For a misdemeanor of the fourth degree, not more than 30 days.
      (2)   A.   A court that sentences an offender to a jail term under
division (b) of this section may permit the offender to serve the sentence in
intermittent confinement or may authorize a limited release of the offender as
provided in division (d)(2) of this section.  The court retains jurisdiction
over every offender sentenced to jail to modify the jail sentence imposed at
any time, but the court shall not reduce any mandatory jail term.
         B.   1.   If a prosecutor, as defined in R.C. § 2935.01, has filed a
notice with the court that the prosecutor wants to be notified about a
particular case and if the court is considering modifying the jail sentence of
the offender in that case, the court shall notify the prosecutor that the court
is considering modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case. The
prosecutor may request a hearing regarding the court’s consideration of
modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, and, if the
prosecutor requests a hearing, the court shall notify the eligible offender of
the hearing.
            2.   If the prosecutor requests a hearing regarding the court’s
consideration of modifying the jail sentence of the offender in that case, the
court shall hold the hearing before considering whether or not to release the
offender from the offender’s jail sentence.
      (3)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under division (b)
of this section and the court assigns the offender to a County Jail that has
established a County Jail Industry Program pursuant to Ohio R.C. 5147.30, the
court shall specify, as part of the sentence, whether the offender may be
considered for participation in the program. During the offender's term in the
County Jail, the court retains jurisdiction to modify its specification
regarding the offender's participation in the County Jail Industry Program.
      (4)   If a person sentenced to a jail term pursuant to division (b) of
this section, the court may impose as part of the sentence pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 2929.28 a reimbursement sanction, and, if the local detention facility in
which the term is to be served is covered by a policy adopted pursuant to Ohio
R.C.  307.93, 341.14, 341.19, 341.21, 341.23, 753.02, 753.04, 753.16, 2301.56,
or 2947.19 and Ohio R.C. 2929.37, both of the following apply:
         A.   The court shall specify both of the following as part of the
sentence:
            1.   If the person is presented with an itemized bill pursuant to
Ohio R.C. 2929.37 for payment of the costs of confinement, the person is
required to pay the bill in accordance with that section.
            2.   If the person does not dispute the bill described in division
(b)(4)A.1. of this section and does not pay the bill by the times specified in
Ohio R.C. 2929.37, the Clerk of the Court may issue a certificate of judgment
against the person as described in that section.
         B.   The sentence automatically includes any certificate of judgment
issued as described in division (b)(4)A.2. of this section.
      (5)   If an offender who is convicted of or pleads guilty to a violation
of Ohio R.C. 4511.19(B), or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance,
also is convicted of or also pleads guilty to a specification of the type
described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1414 and if the court imposes a jail term on the
offender for the underlying offense, the court shall impose upon the offender
an additional definite jail term of not more than six months. The additional
jail term shall not be reduced pursuant to any provision of the Ohio Revised
Code. The offender shall serve the additional jail term consecutively to and
prior to the jail term imposed for the underlying offense and consecutively to
any other mandatory term imposed in relation to the offense.
      (6)   A.   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and to a specification of the
type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 and if the court imposes a jail term on
the offender for the misdemeanor violation, the court may impose upon the
offender an additional definite jail term as follows:
            1.   Subject to division (b)(6)A.2. of this section, an additional
definite jail term of not more than 60 days;
            2.   If the offender previously has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to one or more misdemeanor or felony violations of Ohio R.C. 2907.22,
2907.23, 2907.24, 2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance, and also was convicted of or pleaded guilty to a
specification of the type described in Ohio R.C. 2941.1421 regarding one or
more of those violations, an additional definite jail term of not more than 120
days.
         B.   In lieu of imposing an additional definite jail term under
division (b)(6)A. of this section, the court may directly impose on the
offender a sanction that requires the offender to wear a real-time processing,
continual tracking electronic monitoring device during the period of time
specified by the court. The period of time specified by the court shall equal
the duration of an additional jail term that the court could have imposed upon
the offender under division (b)(6)A. of this section. A sanction imposed under
this division shall commence on the date specified by the court, provided that
the sanction shall not commence until after the offender has served the jail
term imposed for the misdemeanor violation of Ohio R.C. 2907.23, 2907.24,
2907.241, or 2907.25, or any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and
any residential sanction imposed for the violation under division (d) of this
section or Ohio R.C. 2929.26. A sanction imposed under this division shall be
considered to be a community control sanction for purposes of division (c) or
this section or Ohio R.C. 2929.25, and all provisions of this Code and the Ohio
Revised Code that pertain to community control sanctions shall apply to a
sanction imposed under this division, except to the extent that they would by
their nature be clearly inapplicable. The offender shall pay all costs
associated with a sanction imposed under this division, including the cost of
the use of the monitoring device.
      (7)   If an offender is convicted of or pleads guilty to a misdemeanor
violation of R.C. § 2903.13 and also is convicted of or pleads guilty to a
specification of the type described in R.C. § 2941.1423 that charges that the
victim of the violation was a woman whom the offender knew was pregnant at the
time of the violation, the court shall impose on the offender a mandatory jail
term that is a definite term of at least 30 days.
      (8)   If a court sentences an offender to a jail term under this division
(b), the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender and the jail
term. Upon motion of either party or upon the court’s own motion, the court, in
the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may substitute
one or more community control sanctions under division (d) or (e) of this
section for any jail days that are not mandatory jail days.
(ORC 2929.24)
   (c)   Misdemeanor Community Control Sanctions.
      (1)   A.   Except as provided in Ohio R.C. 2929.22 and 2929.23 or when a
jail term is required by law, in sentencing an offender for a misdemeanor,
other than a minor misdemeanor, the sentencing court may do either of the
following:
            1.   Directly impose a sentence that consists of one or more
community control sanctions authorized by divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this
section. The court may impose any other conditions of release under a community
control sanction that the court considers appropriate. If the court imposes a
jail term upon the offender, the court may impose any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions in addition to the jail
term.
            2.   Impose a jail term under division (b) of this section from the
range of jail terms authorized under that division for the offense, suspend all
or a portion of the jail term imposed, and place the offender under a community
control sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
divisions (d), (e), or (f) of this section.
         B.   The duration of all community control sanctions imposed upon an
offender and in effect for an offender at any time shall not exceed five years.
         C.   At sentencing, if a court directly imposes a community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)
(1)A.1. of this section, the court shall state the duration of the community
control sanctions imposed and shall notify the offender that if any of the
conditions of the community control sanctions are violated the court may do any
of the following:
            1.   Impose a longer time under the same community control sanction
if the total time under all of the offender's community control sanctions does
not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this section;
            2.   Impose a more restrictive community control sanction under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, but the court is not required to
impose any particular sanction or sanctions;
            3.   Impose a definite jail term from the range of jail terms
authorized for the offense under division (b) of this section.
      (2)   If a court sentences an offender to any community control sanction
or combination of community control sanctions pursuant to division (c)(1)A.1.
of this section, the sentencing court retains jurisdiction over the offender
and the period of community control for the duration of the period of community
control. Upon the motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the
court, in the court’s sole discretion and as the circumstances warrant, may
modify the community control sanctions or conditions of release previously
imposed, substitute a community control sanction or condition of release for
another community control sanction or condition of release previously imposed,
or impose an additional community control sanction or condition of release.
      (3)   A.   If a court sentences an offender to any community control
sanction or combination of community control sanctions authorized under
division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, the court shall place the offender
under the general control and supervision of the court or of a department of
probation in the jurisdiction that serves the court for purposes of reporting
to the court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. If
the offender resides in another jurisdiction and a department of probation has
been established to serve the Municipal Court or County Court in that
jurisdiction, the sentencing court may request the Municipal Court or the
County Court to receive the offender into the general control and supervision
of that department of probation for purposes of reporting to the sentencing
court a violation of any of the conditions of the sanctions imposed. The
sentencing court retains jurisdiction over any offender whom it sentences for
the duration of the sanction or sanctions imposed.
         B.   The sentencing court shall require as a condition of any
community control sanction that the offender abide by the law and not leave the
State without the permission of the court or the offender's probation officer.
In the interests of doing justice, rehabilitating the offender, and ensuring
the offender's good behavior, the court may impose additional requirements on
the offender.  The offender's compliance with the additional requirements also
shall be a condition of the community control sanction imposed upon the
offender.
      (4)   A.   If the court imposing sentence upon an offender sentences the
offender to any community control sanction or combination of community control
sanctions authorized under division (d), (e), or (f) of this section, and the
offender violates any of the conditions of the sanctions, the public or private
person or entity that supervises or administers the program or activity that
comprises the sanction shall report the violation directly to the sentencing
court or to the department of probation or probation officer with general
control and supervision over the offender. If the public or private person or
entity reports the violation to the department of probation or probation
officer, the department or officer shall report the violation to the sentencing
court.
         B.   If an offender violates any condition of a community control
sanction, the sentencing court may impose upon the violator one or more of the
following penalties:
            1.   A longer time under the same community control sanction if the
total time under all of the community control sanctions imposed on the violator
does not exceed the five-year limit specified in division (c)(1)B. of this
section;
            2.   A more restrictive community control sanction;
            3.   A combination of community control sanctions, including a jail
term.
         C.   If an offender was acting pursuant to R.C. § 2925.11(B)(2)(b), or
any substantially equivalent municipal ordinance, and in so doing violated the
conditions of a community control sanction based on a minor drug possession
offense, as defined in R.C. § 2925.11, the sentencing court may consider the
offender’s conduct in seeking or obtaining medical assistance for another in
good faith or for self or may consider the offender being the subject of
another person seeking or obtaining medical assistance in accordance with that
division as a mitigating factor before imposing any of the penalties described
in division (c)(4)B. of this section.
         D.   If the court imposes a jail term upon a violator pursuant to
division (c)(4)B. of this section, the total time spent in jail for the
misdemeanor offense and the violation of a condition of the community control
sanction shall not exceed the maximum jail term available for the offense for
which the sanction that was violated was imposed. The court may reduce the
longer period of time that the violator is required to spend under the longer
sanction or the more restrictive sanction imposed under division (c)(4)B. of
this section by all or part of the time the violator successfully spent under
the sanction that was initially imposed.
      (5)   Except as otherwise provided in this division, if an offender, for
a significant period of time, fulfills the conditions of a community control
sanction imposed pursuant to division (d), (e), or (f) of this section in an
exemplary manner, the court may reduce the period of time under the community
control sanction or impose a less restrictive community control sanction.
Fulfilling the conditions of a community control sanction does not relieve the
offender of a duty to make restitution under division (f) of this section.
(ORC 2929.25)
   (d)   Community Residential Sanction.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any community residential sanction or combination of
community residential sanctions under this division (d).  Community residential
sanctions include, but are not limited to, the following:
         A.   A term of up to 180 days in a halfway house or a term in a
halfway house not to exceed the longest jail term available for the offense,

responsibility for paying the costs of confining the offender in a jail has
entered into a contract with the halfway house for use of the facility for
misdemeanor offenders;
         B.   If the offender is an eligible offender, as defined in R.C. §
307.932, a term in a community alternative sentencing center or district
community alternative sentencing center established and operated in accordance
with that section, in the circumstances specified in that section, with one of
the conditions of the sanction being that the offender successfully complete
the portion of the sentence to be served in the center.
      (2)   A sentence to a community residential sanction under division (d)
(1)B. of this section shall be in accordance with R.C. § 307.932. In all other
cases, the court that sentences an offender to a community residential sanction
under this division (d) may do either or both of the following:
         A.   Permit the offender to serve the offender's sentence in
intermittent confinement, overnight, on weekends or at any other time or times
that will allow the offender to continue at the offender' occupation or care
for the offender' family;
         B.   Authorize the offender to be released so that the offender may
seek or maintain employment, receive education or training, receive treatment,
perform community service, or otherwise fulfill an obligation imposed by law or
by the court. A release pursuant to this division shall be only for the
duration of time that is needed to fulfill the purpose of the release and for
travel that reasonably is necessary to fulfill the purposes of release.
      (3)   The court may order that a reasonable portion of the income earned
by the offender upon a release pursuant to division (d)(2) of this section be
applied to any financial sanction imposed under division (f) of this section.
      (4)   No court shall sentence any person to a prison term for a
misdemeanor or minor misdemeanor or to a jail term for a minor misdemeanor.
      (5)   If a court sentences a person who has been convicted of or pleaded
guilty to a misdemeanor to a community residential sanction as described in
division (d)(1) of this section, at the time of reception and at other times
the person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community
alternative sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing
center, or other place at which the offender will serve the residential
sanction determines to be appropriate, the person in charge of the operation of
the halfway house, community alternative sentencing center, district community
alternative sentencing center, or other place may cause the convicted offender
to be examined and tested for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis, including
but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, and other contagious diseases. The
person in charge of the operation of the halfway house, community alternative
sentencing center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other
place at which the offender will serve the residential sanction may cause a
convicted offender in the halfway house, community alternative sentencing
center, district community alternative sentencing center, or other place who
refuses to be tested or treated for tuberculosis, HIV infection, hepatitis,
including but not limited to hepatitis A, B and C, or another contagious
disease to be tested and treated involuntarily.
      (6)   The Municipality may enter into a contract with a halfway house for
use of the halfway house to house misdemeanor offenders under a sanction
imposed under division (d)(1)A. of this section.
(ORC 2929.26)
   (e)   Nonresidential Sanction Where Jail Term is not Mandatory.
      (1)   Except when a mandatory jail term is required by law, the court
imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a minor misdemeanor, may
impose upon the offender any nonresidential sanction or combination of
nonresidential sanctions authorized under this division.  Nonresidential

ordinance or a violation of Ohio R.C.  2903.13 or a substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance involving a person who was a family or household member at
the time of the violation, if the offender committed the offense in the
vicinity of one or more children who are not victims of the offense, and if the
offender or the victim of the offense is a parent, guardian, custodian, or
person in loco parentis of one or more of those children. This division does
not limit the court in requiring that the offender obtain counseling for any
offense or in any circumstance not specified in this division.
      (2)   If the court imposes a term of community service pursuant to
division (e)(1)C. of this section, the offender may request that the court
modify the sentence to authorize the offender to make a reasonable
contribution, as determined by the court, to the general fund of the county,
municipality, or other local entity that provides funding to the court. The
court may grant the request if the offender demonstrates a change in
circumstances from the date the court imposes the sentence or that the
modification would otherwise be in the interests of justice. If the court
grants the request, the offender shall make a reasonable contribution to the
court, and the clerk of the court shall deposit that contribution into the
general fund of the county, municipality, or other local entity that provides
funding to the court. If more than one entity provides funding to the court,
the clerk shall deposit a percentage of the reasonable contribution equal to
the percentage of funding the entity provides to the court in that entity’s
general fund.
      (3)   In addition to the sanctions authorized under division (e)(1) of
this section, the court imposing a sentence for a misdemeanor, other than a
minor misdemeanor, upon an offender who is not required to serve a mandatory
jail term may impose any other sanction that is intended to discourage the
offender or other persons from committing a similar offense if the sanction is
reasonably related to the overriding purposes and principles of misdemeanor
sentencing.
      (4)   The court imposing a sentence for a minor misdemeanor may impose a
term of community service in lieu of all or part of a fine. The term of
community service imposed for a minor misdemeanor shall not exceed 30 hours.
After imposing a term of community service, the court may modify the sentence
to authorize a reasonable contribution, as determined by the court, to the
appropriate general fund as provided in division (e)(2) of this section.
(ORC 2929.27)
   (f)   Financial Sanctions.
      (1)   In addition to imposing court costs pursuant to Ohio R.C. 2947.23,
the court imposing a sentence upon an offender for a misdemeanor, including a
minor misdemeanor, may sentence the offender to any financial sanction or
combination of financial sanctions authorized under this division (f). If the
court in its discretion imposes one or more financial sanctions, the financial
sanctions that may be imposed pursuant to this section include, but are not
limited to, the following:
         A.   Restitution.
            1.   Unless the misdemeanor offense is a minor misdemeanor or could
be disposed of by the Traffic Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic
Rule 13, restitution by the offender to the victim of the offender’s crime or
any survivor of the victim, in an amount based upon the victim’s economic loss.
The court may not impose restitution as a sanction pursuant to this division if
the offense is a minor misdemeanor or could be disposed of by the Traffic
Violations Bureau serving the court under Traffic Rule 13. If the court
requires restitution, the court shall order that the restitution be made to the
victim in open court or to the adult probation department that serves the
jurisdiction or the clerk of the court on behalf of the victim.
            2.   If the court imposes restitution, the court shall determine
the amount of restitution to be paid by the offender. If the court imposes
restitution, the court may base the amount of restitution it orders on an
amount recommended by the victim, the offender, a presentence investigation
report, estimates or receipts indicating the cost of repairing or replacing
property, and other information, provided that the amount the court
               orders as restitution shall not exceed the amount of economic
loss suffered by the victim as a direct and proximate result of the commission
of the offense. If the court decides to impose restitution, the court shall
hold an evidentiary hearing on restitution if the offender, victim, or survivor
disputes the amount of restitution. If the court holds an evidentiary hearing,
at the hearing the victim or survivor has the burden to prove by a
preponderance of the evidence the amount of restitution sought from the
offender.
            3.   All restitution payments shall be credited against any
recovery of economic loss in a civil action brought by the victim or any
survivor of the victim against the offender.  No person may introduce evidence
of an award of restitution under this section in a civil action for purposes of
imposing liability against an insurer under R.C. § 3937.18.
            4.   If the court imposes restitution, the court may order that the
offender pay a surcharge, of not more than 5% of the amount of the restitution
otherwise ordered, to the entity responsible for collecting and processing
restitution payments.
            5.   The victim or survivor of the victim may request that the
prosecutor in the case file a motion, or the offender may file a motion, for
modification of the payment terms of any restitution ordered. If the court
grants the motion, it may modify the payment terms as it determines
appropriate.

minor misdemeanor pursuant to division (e)(4) of this section in lieu of or in
addition to imposing a financial sanction under this section and in addition to
imposing court costs. If a person fails to pay a financial sanction or court
costs, the court may order community service in lieu of the financial sanction

section.

division (f), the court imposing sentence upon an offender for misdemeanor
domestic violence or menacing by stalking may impose a fine of not less than
seventy dollars ($70.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00), which
shall be transmitted to the Treasurer of Ohio to be credited to the address
confidentiality program fund created by R.C. § 111.48.
      (5)   A.   Except as otherwise provided in this division (f)(5), a
financial sanction imposed under division (f)(1) of this section is a judgment
in favor of the State or the political subdivision that operates the court that
imposed the financial sanction, and the offender subject to the financial
sanction is the judgment debtor. A financial sanction of reimbursement imposed
pursuant to division (f)(1)C.1.a. of this section upon an offender is a
judgment in favor of the entity administering the community control sanction,
and the offender subject to the financial sanction is the judgment debtor. A
financial sanction of restitution imposed pursuant to division (f)(1)A. of this
section is an order in favor of the victim of the offender’s criminal act that
can be collected through a certificate of judgment as described in division (f)
(5)B.1. of this section, through execution as described in division (f)(5)B.2.
of this section or through an order as described in division (f)(5)B.3. of this
section and the offender shall be considered for purposes of the collection as
a judgment debtor.
         B.   Once a financial sanction is imposed as a judgment or order under
this division, the victim, private provider, State, or political subdivision
may do any of the following:
            1.   Obtain from the Clerk of the court in which the judgment was
entered a certificate of judgment that shall be in the same manner and form as
a certificate of judgment issued in a civil action;
            2.   Obtain execution of the judgment or order through any
available procedure, including any of the procedures identified in Ohio R.C.
2929.18(D)(1) and (D)(2) or a substantially equivalent municipal ordinance.
            3.   Obtain an order for the assignment of wages of the judgment
debtor under Ohio R.C. 1321.33 or a substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance.
      (6)   The civil remedies authorized under division (f)(5) of this section
for the collection of the financial sanction supplement, but do not preclude,
enforcement of the criminal sentence.
      (7)   Each court imposing a financial sanction upon an offender under
this division (f) may designate the Clerk of the Court or another person to
collect the financial sanction. The Clerk, or another person authorized by law
or the court to collect the financial sanction may do the following:
         A.   Enter into contracts with one or more public agencies or private
vendors for the collection of amounts due under the sanction. Before entering
into a contract for the collection of amounts due from an offender pursuant to
any financial sanction imposed pursuant to this division (f), a court shall
comply with Ohio R.C. 307.86 to 307.92.
         B.   Permit payment of all or any portion of the sanction in
installments, by financial transaction device if the court is a County Court or
a Municipal Court operated by a county, or by any other reasonable method, in
any time, and on any terms that the court considers just, except that the
maximum time permitted for payment shall not exceed five years. If the court is
a County Court or a Municipal Court operated by a county, the acceptance of
payments by any financial transaction device shall be governed by the policy
adopted by the Board of County Commissioners of the county pursuant to Ohio
R.C. 301.28. If the court is a Municipal Court not operated by a county, the
Clerk may pay any fee associated with processing an electronic transfer out of
public money or may charge the fee to the offender.
         C.   To defray administrative costs, charge a reasonable fee to an
offender who elects a payment plan rather than a lump sum payment of any
financial sanction.
      (8)   No financial sanction imposed under this division (f) shall
preclude a victim from bringing a civil action against the offender.

      (4)   If the dog is sold, given to another person, or dies, notify the

      (2)   Upon the issuance of a dangerous dog registration certificate to
the owner of a dog, the County Auditor shall provide the owner with a uniformly
designed tag that identifies the animal as a dangerous dog. The owner shall
renew the certificate annually for the same fee and in the same manner as the

      (3)   A.   If the owner of a dangerous dog for whom a registration

section.
(R.C. § 955.22)
   (k)   Hearing.
      (1)   The municipal court or county court that has territorial
jurisdiction over the residence of the owner, keeper, or harborer of a dog
shall conduct any hearing concerning the designation of the dog as a nuisance
dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog.
      (2)   If a person who is authorized to enforce this chapter has
reasonable cause to believe that a dog in the person’s jurisdiction is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the person shall notify the owner,
keeper, or harborer of that dog, by certified mail or in person, of both of the
following:
         A.   That the person has designated the dog a nuisance dog, dangerous
dog, or vicious dog, as applicable;
         B.   That the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog may request a
hearing regarding the designation in accordance with this division (k). The
notice shall include instructions for filing a request for a hearing in the
county in which the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer resides.
      (3)   If the owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog disagrees with the
designation of the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, the owner, keeper, or harborer, not later than ten days after
receiving notification of the designation, may request a hearing regarding the
determination. The request for a hearing shall be in writing and shall be filed
with the municipal court or county court that has territorial jurisdiction over
the residence of the dog’s owner, keeper, or harborer. At the hearing, the
person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog
has the burden of proving, by clear and convincing evidence, that the dog is a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of
the dog or the person who designated the dog as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog,
or vicious dog may appeal the court’s final determination as in any other case
filed in that court.
      (4)   A court, upon motion of an owner, keeper, or harborer or an
attorney representing the owner, keeper, or harborer, may order that the dog
designated as a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog be held in the
possession of the owner, keeper, or harborer until the court makes a final
determination under this section or during the pendency of an appeal, as
applicable. Until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal, the dog shall be confined or restrained in accordance with the
provisions of division (e) that apply to dangerous dogs regardless of whether
the dog has been designated as a vicious dog or a nuisance dog rather than a
dangerous dog. The owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog shall not be required
to comply with any other requirements established in this Code or the Ohio
Revised Code that concern a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, as
applicable, until the court makes a final determination and during the pendency
of any appeal.
      (5)   If a dog is finally determined under this division (k), or on
appeal as described in this division (k), to be a vicious dog, R.C. § 955.11(D)
and divisions (e) to (j) of this section apply with respect to the dog and the
owner, keeper, or harborer of the dog as if the dog were a dangerous dog, and §
505.18 applies with respect to the dog as if it were a dangerous dog, and the
court shall issue an order that specifies that those provisions apply with
respect to the dog and the owner, keeper, or harborer in that manner. As part
of the order, the court shall require the owner, keeper, or harborer to obtain
the liability insurance required under division (f)(1) in an amount described
in division (l)(5)B. of this section.
      (6)   As used in this division (k), “nuisance dog”, “dangerous dog”, and
“vicious dog” have the same meanings as in R.C. § 955.11.
(R.C. § 955.222)
   (l)   Penalty.
      (1)   Whoever recklessly violates division (b) of this section is guilty
of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree.
(R.C. § 951.99)
      (2)   A.   Whoever violates division (c) of this section or commits a
violation of division (d) of this section that involves a dog that is not a
nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog shall be fined not less than $25 or
more than $100 on a first offense, and on each subsequent offense shall be
fined not less than $75 or more than $250 and may be imprisoned for not more
than 30 days.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of
this section, if the offender is guilty of a violation of division (c) of this
section or a violation of division (d) of this section that involves a dog that
is not a nuisance dog, dangerous dog, or vicious dog, the court may order the
offender to personally supervise the dog that the offender owns, keeps, or
harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience training, or to do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(E))
      (3)   A.   Whoever commits a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a nuisance dog is guilty of a minor misdemeanor on the first
offense and of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on each subsequent offense
involving the same dog. Upon a person being convicted of or pleading guilty to
a third violation of division (d) of this section involving the same dog, the
court shall require the offender to register the involved dog as a dangerous
dog.
         B.   In addition to the penalties prescribed in division (l)(2)A. of
this section, if a violation of division (d) of this section involves a
nuisance dog, the court may order the offender to personally supervise the
nuisance dog that the offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to
complete dog obedience training, or to do both.
(R.C. § 955.99(F))
      (4)   Whoever commits a violation of division (d) of this section that
involves a dangerous dog, or a violation of division (e) of this section is
guilty of a misdemeanor of the fourth degree on a first offense and of a
misdemeanor of the third degree on each subsequent offense. Additionally, the
court may order the offender to personally supervise the dangerous dog that the
offender owns, keeps, or harbors, to cause that dog to complete dog obedience
training, or to do both, and the court may order the offender to obtain
liability insurance pursuant to division (f) of this section. The court, in the
alternative, may order the dangerous dog to be humanely destroyed by a licensed
veterinarian, the county dog warden, or the county humane society at the
owner’s expense. With respect to a violation of division (d) of this section
that involves a dangerous dog, until the court makes a final determination and
during the pendency of any appeal of a violation of that division and at the
discretion of the dog warden, the dog shall be confined or restrained in

provided under division (l)(10)A. of this section is less than the actual cost
of confinement of the dog, the owner shall remit the difference between the
security provided and the actual cost to the county dog warden within 30 days
after the court’s determination. If the county dog warden finds that the

   (f)   When considered as a whole, and judged with reference to ordinary

      (1)   Its dominant appeal is to prurient interest;

artistic purpose.

541.01  DETERMINING PROPERTY VALUE IN ARSON.
   (a)    The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or amount of physical harm involved in a violation of Section
541.02.
      (1)    If the property is an heirloom, memento, collector's item,
antique, museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that is
either irreplaceable or is replaceable only on the expenditure of substantial
time, effort or money, the value of the property or the amount of physical harm
involved is the amount that would compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(1) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property can be restored substantially to
its former condition, the amount of physical harm involved is the reasonable
cost of restoring the property.
      (3)    If the property is not covered under subsection (a)(l) hereof, and
the physical harm is such that the property cannot be restored substantially to
its former condition, the value of the property, in the case of personal
property, is the cost of replacing the property with new property of like kind
and quality, and in the case of real property or real property fixtures, is the
difference in the fair market value of the property immediately before and
immediately after the offense.
   (b)    As used in this section, "fair market value" has the same meaning as
in Section
545.02(c)(3).
   (c)   Prima-facie evidence of the value of property, as provided in Section
545.02(d) may be used to establish the value of property pursuant to this
section.

   (a)   If more than one item of property or services is involved in a theft
offense or in a violation of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A) involving a victim who is an
elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent municipal
ordinance, the value of the property or services involved for the purpose of
determining the value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate
value of all property or services involved in the offense.
   (b)   (1)   When a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series
of violations of, attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate,
or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C. 1716.14(A), 2913.02, 2913.03 or
2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43 involving a victim who
is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in
the offender’s same employment, capacity or relationship to another, all of
those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. When a series of offenses
under Ohio R.C. 2913.02, or a series of violations of, attempts to commit a
violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of Ohio R.C.
2913.02 or 2913.43 involving a victim who is an active duty service member or
spouse of an active duty service member, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, is committed by the offender in
the offender's same employment, capacity, or relationship to another, all of
those offenses shall be tried as a single offense. The value of the property or
services involved in the series of offenses for the purpose of determining the
value as required by Ohio R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all
property and services involved in all offenses in the series.
      (2)   If an offender commits a series of offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.02
that involves a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims, all of
the offenses may be tried as a single offense. If an offender is being tried
for the commission of a series of violations of, attempts to commit a violation
of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in violations of R.C. 1716.14(A),
2913.02, 2913.03 or 2913.04, 2913.21(B)(1) or (B)(2), or 2913.31 or 2913.43,
whether committed against one victim or more than one victim, involving a
victim who is an elderly person or disabled adult, or any substantially
equivalent municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If an offender is being tried for the commission of a series of violations of,
attempts to commit a violation of, conspiracies to violate, or complicity in
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.02 or 2913.43, or any substantially equivalent
municipal ordinance to any of these offenses, whether committed against one
victim or more than one victim, involving a victim who is an active duty
service member or spouse of an active duty service member pursuant to a scheme
or course of conduct, all of those offenses may be tried as a single offense.
If the offenses are tried as a single offense, the value of the property or
services involved for the purpose of determining the value as required by Ohio
R.C. 2913.61(A) is the aggregate value of all property and services involved in
all of the offenses in the course of conduct.
      (3)   When a series of two or more offenses under Ohio R.C. 2913.40,
2913.48, or 2921.41 is committed by the offender in the offender’s same

more offenses.
      (4)   In prosecuting a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2) or
(b)(3) of this section, it is not necessary to separately allege and prove each
offense in the series. Rather, it is sufficient to allege and prove that the
offender, within a given span of time, committed one or more theft offenses or
violations of Ohio R.C. 2913.40, 2913.48, or 2921.41 in the offender’s same
employment, capacity, or relationship to another as described in division (b)
(1) or (b)(3) of this section, or committed one or more theft offenses that
involve a common course of conduct to defraud multiple victims or a scheme or
course of conduct as described in division (b)(2) of this section. While it is
not necessary to separately allege and prove each offense in the series in
order to prosecute a single offense under division (b)(1), (b)(2), or (b)(3) of
this section, it remains necessary in prosecuting them as a single offense to
prove the aggregate value of the property or services in order to meet the
requisite statutory offense level sought by the prosecution.
   (c)   The following criteria shall be used in determining the value of
property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   The value of an heirloom, memento, collector’s item, antique,
museum piece, manuscript, document, record or other thing that has intrinsic
worth to its owner and that either is irreplaceable or is replaceable only on
the expenditure of substantial time, effort or money, is the amount which would
compensate the owner for its loss.
      (2)   The value of personal effects and household goods, and of
materials, supplies, equipment and fixtures used in the profession, business,
trade, occupation, or avocation of its owner, which property is not covered
under division (c)(1) of this section, and which retains substantial utility
for its purpose regardless of its age or condition, is the cost of replacing
the property with new property of like kind and quality.
      (3)   The value of any real or personal property that is not covered
under division (c)(1) or (c)(2) of this section, and the value of services, is
the fair market value of the property or services. As used in this section,
“fair market value” is the money consideration which a buyer would give and a
seller would accept for property or services, assuming that the buyer is
willing to buy and the seller is willing to sell, that both are fully informed
as to all facts material to the transaction, and that neither is under any
compulsion to act.
   (d)   Without limitation on the evidence which may be used to establish the
value of property or services involved in a theft offense:
      (1)   When the property involved is personal property held for sale at
wholesale or retail, the price at which the property was held for sale is prima
facie evidence of its value.
      (2)   When the property involved is a security or commodity traded on an
exchange, the closing price or, if there is no closing price, the asked price,
given in the latest marked quotation prior to the offense, is prima facie
evidence of the value of the security or commodity.
      (3)   When the property involved is livestock, poultry or raw
agricultural products for which a local market price is available, the latest
local market price prior to the offense is prima facie evidence of the value of
the livestock, poultry or products.
      (4)   When the property involved is a negotiable instrument, the face
value is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (5)   When the property involved is a warehouse receipt, bill of lading,
pawn ticket, claim check or other instrument entitling the holder or bearer to
receive property, the face value or, if there is no face value, the value of
the property covered by the instrument less any payment necessary to receive
the property, is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (6)   When the property involved is a ticket of admission, ticket for
transportation, coupon, token or other instrument entitling the holder or
bearer to receive property or services, the face value or, if there is no face
value, the value of the property or services which may be received by the
instrument is prima facie evidence of the value of the instrument.
      (7)   When the services involved are gas, electricity, water, telephone,
transportation, shipping or other services for which the rate is established by
law, the duly established rate is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.
      (8)   When the services involved are services for which the rate is not
established by law, and the offender has been notified prior to the offense of
the rate for the services, either in writing or orally, or by posting in a
manner reasonably calculated to come to the attention of potential offenders,
the rate contained in the notice is prima facie evidence of the value of the
services.

yearly expenditure for collection and treatment of all wastewater with a normal
level of BOD, SS and other pollutants, This value shall be determined by
deducting the cost of treating high level pollutant (CH) from the total annual
expenditure for collection and treatment (C).
   (v)    Treatment Cost of High Level BOD (YB). The cost of treatment per unit
of high level BOD. This cost shall be determined by first multiplying the total
annual BOD(B) by the percent high level BOD (BH). This result shall then be
divided into the total cost of treating high level BOD (ZB)
   (w)    Treatment Cost of High Level SS (YS). The cost of treatment per unit
of high level SS. This shall be determined by first multiplying the total
annual SS (S) by the percent high level SS (S H ). This result shall then be
divided into the total cost of treating high level SS (Z S )
   (x)    Treatment Cost of High Level Other Pollutants. The cost of treatment
per unit of the pollutant in question. This cost shall be determined by first
multiplying the total annual amount of the pollutant (O) by the percent high
level (O H ). The result shall then be divided into the total cost of treating
the high level pollutant (Z O ).

933.08  USER CHARGE ELEMENTS AND DETERMINATIONS.
   The basic user charges for all users connected to and discharging sewage,
industrial wastes, water or other liquids into the City Treatment Works shall
consist of the following:
   (a)    Administrative Fee.
      (1)    Definition. A flat rate charged per bill for administrative costs
levied to all active users without regard to volume of discharge or usage.
      (2)    Determination. Divide the annual administrative costs (C A ) by
the total annual bills (T) to determine the charge per bill.
   (b)    Treatment Charge for Unaccountable Flow (I/I).
      (1)    Definition. A flat rate charge per connection for treatment of
fifty percent (50%) of the unaccountable flow levied to all active users
without regard to volume of discharge or usage.
      (2)    Determination. Multiply the annual expenditure for normal level
pollutant treatment (C N ) times half of the percent of unaccounted flow (1/2P
U ). Divide the result by the total users (U). The resulting annual charge is
then divided by the number of billing periods per year to determine the charge
per bill.
   (c)    Volumetric Usage Charge.
      (1)    Definition. Charge per unit of discharge or volumetric usage for
collection and treatment of all accountable flow and one-half unaccountable
flow with normal level pollutants. To be levied to all users in relation to the
provisions of Sections
933.11 through
933.16 inclusive.
      (2)    Determination. Multiply the annual expenditure for normal level
pollutant treatment (C N ) by the percent accountable volume (P A ) plus one-
half the percent unaccountable flow (1/2 P U ).  Divide the result by annual
accountable volume (V A ) to determine the cost per unit of discharge.
   (d)    Inflation Surcharge.
      (1)    Definition. Rate charged per dollar billed to account for
inflation of all costs associated with the Wastewater Treatment System.
      (2)   Determination. The sum of all billing charges shall be multiplied
by a percentage equal to the annual inflation rate for the previous year as
measured by the Consumer Price Index.  The resulting product shall be added to
the other charges.

933.09  HIGH LEVEL POLLUTANT SURCHARGE.
   (a)   Where flows and loads are discharged in excess of the limitations
established in Section
933.12(b), a surcharge over and above the charges established in Section
933.08 shall be levied on all flows and loadings which are in excess of the
limitations set forth.
   (b)   The surcharge rate shall be calculated annually for each user
discharging wastewater with high level pollutant in accordance with the volumes
and amounts established in Section
933.07 to be effective January 1 of each year.
   (c)   For each user determined to be discharging high levels of BOD, SS or
other selected pollutants, an estimated annual discharge shall be determined
for each pollutant listed herein. This discharge shall be that amount exceeding
concentrations considered to be normal (e.g., 200 mg/1 BOD). The basis for this
figure shall be samples taken at random from the users discharge at the
discretion of the Superintendent, but at least annually.
   (d)   Determination of Surcharge.
      Surcharge = (A B x Y B ) + (A S x Y S ) + (A O +Y O )
      Where:
         A B = Annual discharge of BOD by user in excess of normal level.
         Y B = High level of BOD treatment cost per unit.
         A S = Annual discharge of SS by user in excess of normal level.
         Y S = High level SS treatment cost per unit.
         A O = Annual discharge of other pollutants by user in excess of normal
amounts.

wastewater discharge. (A.O.)
   In subsection (b)(2) hereof, a factor of seventy percent (70%) shall be
applied to the volume of water used by the premises, whether such volume is
measured or estimated, to determine the volume of wastewater discharged by the
premises. This volume shall be used to determine the volumetric usage charge
specified in Section
933.08.
(Ord. 31-81. Passed 12-1-81.)
   (c)   Premises With Metered Public Water and Other Sources of Water Supply.

conveyance or otherwise, shall comply with these subdivision regulations and
shall be platted in accordance herewith.
(Ord. 25-1980.  Passed 9-2-80.)
1109.02  DIVISION OF LAND WITHOUT PLAT.
   (a)   Whoever divides any parcel of land, whether by instrument of
conveyance or otherwise, for which division no plat is required by reason of
Ohio R.C. 711.001, and 711.131, shall submit such division, together with a
sketch identifying such division, to the Chairman of the Planning Commission or

such division of a parcel of land "Approved by the Planning Commission of the
City of Canal Fulton, Ohio; no plat required", sign his name and the date of
approval.
(Ord. 25-1980.  Passed 9-2-80.)
1109.03  STAGES OF SUBDIVISION APPROVAL.
   Subdivision shall be approved in three stages: sketch plan discussion stage,
preliminary plat stage, and final plat stage.
   (a)   The Sketch Plan Discussion Stage requires the subdivider to discuss
the proposed subdivision with the Planning Commission so that he can become
familiar with the subdivision regulations and the Commission can be aware of
future developments.
      (1)   Eight copies of the sketch plan shall be submitted to the Chairman
of the Planning Commission at least seven days prior to a regularly scheduled
meeting.
      (2)   Within thirty days of submission of the sketch plan the Chairman of
the Planning Commission shall mail a report of the comments and suggestions of
the City and its engineer to the developer.
      (3)   The format and requirements for the sketch plan are found in
Chapter 1113.
   (b)   The Preliminary Plat shall contain all the requirements of
Chapter 1113 and eight copies shall be prepared.  Seven copies shall be
transmitted to the Chairman of the Planning Commission and one to the City
Engineer at least seven days prior to a regularly scheduled meeting.
      (1)   A preliminary plat does not have the legal status of a final plat
and it can be modified by the Planning Commission to solve unforeseen problems.
      (2)   A.   Plat approval or rejection.  In accordance with Ohio R.C.
711.09, the Planning Commission shall certify the date of the plat submission
and the approval or the refusal to approve shall take place within thirty days
thereafter, or such further time as the applying party may agree to; otherwise,
such plat is deemed approved and may be recorded as if bearing such approval.
         B.   A preliminary plat shall be submitted to the Planning Commission
prior to the completion of the final surveys of roads and lots and before the
start of any grading or construction work upon the proposed streets and before
any plat of the subdivision is made in a form suitable for recording.  The
Planning Commission shall determine whether a preliminary plat is in proper
form and shall not receive and consider such a map as filed until it is
submitted in accordance with the requirements hereof.  Where the preliminary
plat covers only a part of the subdivider's entire holding, a sketch of the
prospective future development shall be furnished and the street system of the
submitted part will be considered in light of adjustments and connection with
the street system of the area not submitted for platting.
      (3)   Approval of the preliminary plat and proposed improvements shall be
effective for a period of eighteen months.  If the final plat has not been
recorded within this time limit, the preliminary plat must again be submitted
to the Planning Commission for approval.  However, if the allotment is in the
process of preliminary construction of improvements at the end of such eighteen
months, this provision may be waived by the Planning Commission.
   (c)   The Final Plat shall upon proper application be submitted to the
Planning Commission for approval prior to recording.  Final plats shall conform
to the approved preliminary plat and to these regulations; however, a final
plat may be for all or a portion of the area shown to be subdivided provided
that a preliminary plat has been filed and approved for the entire subdivision.

1117.01  PHYSICAL CONSIDERATIONS.
   (a)   Natural Land Use.  Subdivisions should be planned to take advantage of
the topography of the land to economize in the construction of drainage
facilities to reduce the amount of grading, and to minimize destruction of
trees and topsoil.
   (b)   Land Suitability.  If the Planning Commission finds that land proposed
to be subdivided is unsuitable for subdivision due to flooding, inadequate
drainage, soil and rock formations with severe limitations for development,
susceptibility to mud slides or earth slides, severe erosion potential,
unfavorable topography, inadequate water supply or sewage disposal capabilities
or any other feature harmful to the health, safety, or welfare of the future
residents of the proposed subdivision or community; and if from their
investigation it is found to be in the best interest of the public that the
land not be subdivided, then the Planning Commission shall not approve the plat
unless adequate methods are provided by the subdivider to remedy the problems.
   (c)   Historic Landmarks and Natural Features.  The preservation of
historical landmarks shall be required and due consideration shall be given to
preserving outstanding natural features such as scenic spots, water bodies or
exceptionally fine stands of trees.
(Ord. 25-1980.  Passed 9-2-80.)
1117.02  GENERAL STREET STANDARDS.
   (a)   The arrangement, character, extent and location of all streets shall
conform to the adopted General Development Plan.  The design of proposed
streets shall provide for both the continuation of existing streets and access
to adjacent unplatted lands so that the entire area can be served with a
coordinated street system.
   (b)   Existing or projected collector streets in adjoining areas shall be
continued in new subdivisions and local residential streets shall be continued
to prevent dead-end streets.
   (c)   No street arrangement shall be approved that prevents convenient
future access to adjoining undeveloped property.
   (d)   Local residential streets shall be designed so as not to offer direct
routes to through traffic.
   (e)   Where a subdivision abuts or contains an existing or proposed arterial
street, the Planning Commission may require marginal access streets, reverse
frontage with screen planting contained in a nonaccess reservation along the
rear property line, deep lots with rear service alleys, or other such treatment
as may be necessary for adequate protection of residential properties and to
afford separation of through and local traffic.
   (f)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad right of way, or
limited access highway right of way, the Planning Commission may require a
street parallel to and on each side of such right of way, at a distance
suitable for the appropriate use of the intervening land, as for park purposes
in residential districts, or for commercial or industrial  purposes in
appropriate districts.  Such distances shall also be determined with due regard
for the requirements of approach grades and future grade separation.
(Ord. 25-1980.  Passed 9-2-80.)
1117.03  STREET CLASSIFICATION.
   Street classification is the designation of streets and highways into
systems according to the function they perform.  The systems used for the
Street Classification are:
   (a)   Freeway:  A divided multi-lane highway for through traffic with all
crossroads separated in grade with full control of access.
   (b)   Expressway:  A divided arterial highway (not a freeway) for through
traffic with full or partial control of access, medians, at grade intersections
and some grade separations.
   (c)   Arterial:  A general term denoting a highway primarily for through
traffic usually on a continuous route.  This facility provides for through
traffic movement between areas, across the county, and to and from
expressways.  An arterial also provides access to abutting property but parking
and loading may be restricted to improve the capacity for moving traffic.
   (d)   Collector:  A street providing for traffic movement between major
arterials and local streets, and direct access to abutting property.  This
facility provides for the internal traffic movement within an area of the City.
   (e)   Local:  A street or road whose present function is to provide access
to residence, business, or other abutting property.  A local moves a vehicle
from an individual property to the nearest collector.

system is included, it shall be designed to assure that pedestrians can walk
safely and easily on a site, between properties and activities or special
features within the neighborhood open space system.  Sidewalks/walkways should
connect with off road trails, which in turn should link with potential open
space on adjoining underdeveloped parcels, (or with existing open space on
adjoining developed parcels, where applicable).
      The sidewalks/walkways shall be maintained by the Owners Association, or
other maintenance arrangement approved by the Planning Commission.  Deed
restrictions for sidewalks/walkways are required to include the following
language:
         No governmental body is responsible or liable for the care, repair,
replacement or maintenance of said sidewalks/walkways and the Owners
Association for such development shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless all
governmental bodies for any and all such claims or any kind or nature that may
arise or be related to the sidewalks/walkways.
   (d)   Staging of Residential Planned Development.  Each stage of a Planned

future related stages in the event future stages are not constructed.  The
construction and provision of all of the Common Open Spaces and public and
recreational facilities shown on the Final Plat must proceed at the same rate
as the construction of dwelling units.
   (e)   Open Space.  For requirements regarding Open Space refer to
Chapter 1114.
   (f)   Owners Association.  An Owners Association is a viable tool for owning
and maintaining various aspects of a Subdivision including but not limited to,
Common Areas and Open Space, private roads and sidewalks/walkways and landscape
elements (e.g. gateways, buffers).  Planned Unit Residential Developments with
any private streets shall provide for the establishment of an Owners
Association as part of Preliminary Plan and Final Plat approval.

any kind or nature on Common Areas including but not limited to: Open space,
recreation facilities and private roads.  The Owners Association shall
indemnify, defend and hold harmless all governmental bodies for any and all
claims of any kind or nature that may arise or are related to the Common
areas.  The Owners Association shall at all times maintain general liability
insurance coverage on the Common Areas in an amount of not less than one (1)
million dollars and shall increase the coverage in the future in an amount
determined to be commercially reasonable at said time.
      (2)   A preliminary document including bylaws shall be submitted by the
Developer at the Preliminary Plan Stage.  The bylaws outlining the rules and
regulations of the Owners Association shall be drafted in concurrence with the
Subdivision Regulations.  The final draft of the bylaws as approved by the
Planning Commission shall be filed with the Final Plat and recorded with the
County.  The Owners Association shall be established before any lot/parcel in
the subdivision is sold or any dwelling unit is occupied.  Once established,
the Owners Association shall maintain and exercise control over Common Areas,
Open Space and facilities.  As each lot/parcel is sold, the purchaser must
become a member of the Owners Association and this membership shall be written
in the deed and run with the land in perpetuity.  Owners must pay a pro rate
share of required costs and any assessment levied by the Owners Association can
become a lien on the property if not paid.
      (3)   The development shall comply with the provisions of paragraph 115
of Section
1145.04 of this Planning and Zoning Code.

1129.01  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Subdivisions shall be protected from flood hazard and inundation by
storm water, springs, and other surface waters.  The design and construction of
drainage facilities shall be such that all water courses traversing the
subdivision and water emanating from outside and/or within the subdivision will
be carried through and off the subdivision without any injury to roadway,
residential sites, or residences to be installed within the tract.
   (b)   Existing water courses entering the subdivision shall be received and
discharged from the subdivision as nearly as possible in the manner as existed
prior to the construction of the drainage facilities within the subdivision. 
Design of drainage facilities within the subdivision shall conform to the
ultimate drainage plan for areas within the subdivision watershed.  Run-off
water originating in a subdivision shall be drained to an adequate outlet.  All
acts of pollution as defined in Division A of Ohio R.C. 6111.01 shall be
prohibited.  Also no "sewage", "industrial wastes", or "other wastes", as
defined in Ohio R.C. 6111.01, may be discharged into any water course from the
subdivision.
   (c)   A drainage plan shall be submitted simultaneously with the plat of any
subdivision, showing the proposed scheme of surface drainage.  All necessary
facilities including underground pipe, inlets, catch basins or open drainage
ditches shall be installed to provide for the adequate disposal of subsurface
and surface water and maintenance of natural drainage courses.  The types and
sizes of all drainage facilities used to carry water through and off the
subdivision must be approved by the City Engineer and conform to the
specifications in Appendix A.
   (d)   Where an adequate public storm sewer main is available at the plant
boundary, the subdivider shall construct a storm sewer system to connect with
the storm sewer main.  If such storm sewer systems are not accessible, adequate
storm drainage shall be provided by natural drainage channels with easements of
adequate width as approved by the City Engineer.
   (e)   As a safety measure for the protection of the health and welfare of
the people of Canal Fulton, Ohio, the Council reserves the right to disapprove
any subdivision which is subject to periodic flooding, contains extremely poor
drainage facilities or has other physical impairment.  However, if the
subdivider agrees to make such improvements as will make the area completely
safe for residential occupancy, provided that in lieu of the improvements the
subdivider shall furnish a surety bond or a certified check covering the cost
of the required improvements, the subdivision may be approved subject, however,
to the approval of the Stark County Board of Health and the City Engineer.
(Ord. 25-1980.  Passed 9-2-80.)
1129.02  DESIGN OF DRAINAGE FACILITIES.
   (a)   Hydrologic Design.  Those waterways set forth in an adopted master
plan for drainage for Stark County shall be designed and constructed for the
quantities of water indicated in such master plan.  All other drainageways
shall be designed in accordance with the following frequencies:
      (1)   Major Waterways.  Major waterways are defined as those with a
tributary area in excess of six square miles.  Such major waterways shall be
designed for an average recurrence interval of fifty years.
      (2)   Secondary Waterways.  Secondary waterways are defined as those with
a tributary area of between one-half and six square miles.  Such secondary
waterways shall be designed for an average recurrence interval of ten to
twenty-five years.
      (3)   Minor Waterways.  Minor waterways are defined as those with 320
acres or less of tributary area.  Such minor waterways shall be designed for an
average recurrence interval of five to ten years.
   Design quantities of flow for major waterways and waterways included in an
adopted master plan for drainage will be provided the subdivider by the
county.  Design flows for secondary water ways shall follow the procedures
outlined in Circular No. 4 of the Hydraulics Branch of the Bureau of Public
Roads or Bulletin 43, Ohio Department of Natural Resources.  Design flows for
minor drainage facilities shall be computed by the use of the Rational formula:
   Q = C i A
   Wherein:   Q = Cubic feet per second
         C = Run-off coefficient
         i = Intensity of rain fall, inches per hour
         A = Tributary area
Note: C = O.4 for typical subdivisions.  C shall vary from 0.4 to 0.6 or higher
for high density allotments and special conditions such as large per cent of
paved area, steep slopes and impervious soils.  Intensity (i) to be determined
using ten year frequency curve.
   (b)   Hydraulic Design.
      (1)   The hydraulic design of the subdivision shall be such that, after
accumulating all energy losses through the various drainage transmission
systems within the subdivision, depth of flow in the streets shall not exceed
curb heights for ten year average recurrence intervals and for more remote
events depth of flow or ponding shall not exceed a level which would cause
inundation of foundations or basements in residences constructed within the
subdivision.  Within the subdivision, catch basins shall be so placed along the
streets that the width of flow in the gutter will not exceed two feet for a one
year average recurrence interval and will not exceed top of curb for a ten year
average recurrence interval.
      (2)   Site grading within the subdivision shall be such that all lots
will readily drain.
   (c)   Structural Design.  All bridges, culverts, catch basins, manholes,
inlet structures, etc., placed within the subdivision shall conform to standard
plans on file with the City.  Structural design of all drainage facilities
shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.
      (1)   Open Channels.  Minimum centerline radius of constructed channels
shall be a minimum of five times the top width of the channel.  Minimum bottom
width of constructed channels shall be three feet.
         A.   Earth channels constructed within the subdivision shall have side
slopes of 2:1 or flatter.  Revetment, bank stabilization and stream bed
stabilization, along constructed or natural channels, will be required if the
channel velocities are sufficient to cause bank or invert erosion.
         B.   The top of bank shall be so graded that side drainage will enter
channels only at points where structures are provided to prevent bank erosion. 
The design of open channels shall be in accordance with the Bureau of Public
Roads publication, "Design of Roadside Drainage Channels," Hydraulic Design
Series No. 4.  Earth channels constructed within the subdivision, in those
areas not revetted, shall be seeded over the prepared area (fertilized and
limed) with a mixture of 55 pounds of Kentucky Bluegrass (poa Pratensis) and 75
pounds of Creeping Red Fescue (Restuca rubra) per acre to establish a
vegetative cover.
      (2)   Closed Conduits.  Excepting for adequate natural waterways, as
hereinafter defined and except for allowable gutter flows, all storm drainage
within the subdivision which is capable of being transmitted in a reinforced
concrete pipe thirty inches or less in diameter, shall be carried in a closed
conduit.  Minimal conduit size shall be twelve inches diameter RCP or twelve
inches diameter CMP.  Minimum clearance between top of pipe and ground shall be
fifteen inches.
         A.   The alignment of closed conduits shall be as nearly straight as
practicable without undue bends and angle points; manholes or catch basins
shall be provided at all angle points and at intervals not to exceed 300 feet
for thirty inches and under 500 feet for over thirty inches.  Inverted siphons
shall not be permitted except for temporary structures.
         B.   Plain concrete pipe or equivalent may be used outside of road
rights-of- way provided the strength of such pipe is sufficient to withstand
loads imposed on it.  In areas having run-off water with acid content or other
corrosive effects, all pipe shall be provided with additional lining to assure
a project life of fifty years.  The above-stated pipe policy and the pipe
policy used by the State of Ohio Department of Transportation (ODOT) shall be
used in designing storm sewer systems.
      (3)   Bridges.  All drainage structures having a span of ten feet or
greater and all pipes having a diameter or span of ten feet or greater shall be
defined as bridges.  All calculations and plans pertaining to bridges shall
require both preliminary and final approval from the Stark County Bridge
Engineer.
      (4)   Culvert.
         A.   Minor Culvert.  All culverts having a diameter of thirty-six
inches or less shall be designated as minor culverts and shall be subject to
the same requirements as part 2, "Closed Conduits".  Minor culverts should
extend from right of way to right of way.
         B.   Major Culvert.  All culverts having a diameter greater than
thirty-six inches shall be designated as major culverts.  All major culverts
shall be designed in accordance with the requirements of Circular No. 4 of the
Hydraulics Branch of the Bureau of Public Roads or Bulletin 43 published by the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources and shall be subject to the approval of
the City Engineer.  Major culverts should extend from right of way to right of
way.

1129.03  EASEMENTS FOR DRAINAGE PURPOSES.
   (a)   Easements for Closed Conduits and Appurtenances Thereof.  An easement
of no less than twenty feet in width and sufficient to contain the closed
conduits shall be established on the final map of the subdivision as follows:
"Public Drainage Easement"
Drainage easements for closed conduits shall not traverse a building site and
shall, insofar as possible, be placed along or adjacent to lot boundary lines
in a straight alignment without angle points.
   (b)   Easements Along Streams.  Whenever any stream or important surface
drainage course is located within the area being subdivided, the subdivider
shall provide an easement of sufficient width for the purpose of widening,
deepening, relocating, improving or protecting the stream for drainage.
(Ord. 25-1980.  Passed 9-2-80.)
1129.04  DRAINAGE PLANS.
   The final subdivision map shall include and shall have appended to it
sufficient data for the City Engineer to check the drainage system as proposed
by the subdivider.  The following data shall be provided:

following standards and shall find adequate evidence showing that such use on
the proposed location:
      (1)   Will be designed, constructed, operated and maintained so as to be
harmonious and appropriate in appearance with the existing or intended
character of the general vicinity and that such use will not change the
essential character of the same area;
      (2)   Will not be hazardous or disturbing to existing or future
neighboring uses;
      (3)   Will not be detrimental to property in the immediate vicinity or to
the community as a whole;
      (4)   Will be served adequately by essential public facilities and
services such as highways, streets, police and fire protection, drainage
structures, refuse disposal and schools; or that the persons or agencies
responsible for the establishment of the proposed use shall be able to provide
adequately any such service;
      (5)   Will be in compliance with State, County, and City regulations;
      (6)   Will have vehicular approaches to the property which shall be so
designed as not to create an interference with traffic on surrounding public
streets or roads.

   115   General provisions:  It is the intent of this subsection to permit the
application of modern planning techniques in the development of residential
areas providing:
      (1)   A variety of housing types;
      (2)   A more flexible placing of buildings on the land;
      (3)   Flexibility in placing accessory facilities such as garages or
parking spaces;
      (4)   Flexibility of architectural design; and
      (5)   The clustering of houses and multi-family dwelling units so that
large areas of land can be left in open space.
   The benefits to the developer in a planned unit residential development are:
      (1)   Construction of housing at a greater density than would ordinarily
be permitted in the same district under conventional zoning;
      (2)   A wider choice of housing types than would ordinarily be permitted
in the same district under conventional zoning;
      (3)   Less extensive and thus more economical street lengths due to
clustering of the dwelling units; and
      (4)   Less extensive and more economical extension of water, sewer and
other utilities.
   The benefits to the community are:
      (1)   Open space available for community benefit;
      (2)   More economical maintenance of sewer, water and other utilities due
to the clustering of the dwelling units; and
      (3)   An attractive development option to encourage community development
on a planned basis.
   The planned unit residential development shall be constructed substantially
according to a pre-determined and approved plan subject to the following
general requirements:
      (1)   A planned unit residential development shall cover an area of not
less than ten contiguous acres which shall not be divided into parts;
         (a)   By any state or federal limited access highways;
         (b)   By any large area of land not included in the proposed
development; or
         (c)   By any railroad rights of way.  The existence of public or
private streets or highways (other than limited access highways), electrical
transmission lines, transmission pipes or other rights of way (in fee or
easement) within any area shall not be considered as any large area of land not
included when determining if an area is contiguous.
      (2)   Central sanitary sewerage facilities and central water facilities
shall be required.
      (3)   Thirty percent (30%) of the total land areas must be devoted to
open space dedicated to public use or for the exclusive use of residents of the
planned unit development.  No single park or open space area in a planned unit
residential development shall contain less than three acres of contiguous land.
      (4)   In large planned unit residential developments where a school
enrollment burden may result from the anticipated increased population, the
Planning Commission may require a percentage of the land not to exceed five
percent (5%) to be deeded to the school district for use as a school site.  If
additional school site area is required, then a portion of the open space as
required may be deeded to the school district at the discretion of the Planning
Commission to supplement the school site area.
      (5)   The housing density of a planned unit residential development shall
not exceed eight dwelling units per acre of land excluding land required for
open space and school sites.  (Ex. 10 acres x 30 percent for open space leaves
7 acres. 7 cards x 8 DU/acre = 56 total units.)  Final density will be
determined by the Planning Commission taking into consideration the impact of
the development on the neighborhood as to traffic, utility availability, and
safety.
(Ord. 22-1972.  Passed 8-1-72; Ord. 18-06.  Passed 7-18-06.)
      (6)   Editor's Note: Former subsection (b) hereof was repealed by
Ordinance 23-06, passed July 18, 2006.
      (7)   No single-family lot shall be less than 7,500 square feet or have
less than fifty feet of frontage on a public dedicated street.  The yards shall
comply with the yard requirements of the district in which the development is
located including the options for variable lot size, flexible setback and zero
lot line (proportionally reduced).
      (8)   Multi-family development shall require a minimum lot size of 4,300
square feet per dwelling unit.  All other lot requirements and yard
requirements of the R-4 Residential District for multi-family dwellings shall
apply to the Planned Unit Residential Development.
      (9)   Off-street parking shall be provided as regulated by
Chapter 1183.
      (10)   Developments regulated by this subsection shall conform in all
ways to the subdivision regulations of the City.

used, the plan shall show the required information.
   116   An integrated planned commercial development which is a grouping of
three or more commercial establishments which have common vehicular parking
facilities, controlled access to abutting streets, and are developed under a
unified site plan, shall be permitted provided the following conditions are
met:
      (1)   Only those types of business uses permitted for conventional
development in the district shall be permitted in integrated planned business
developments.
      (2)   The minimum setback building line shall be 100 feet measured from
the street right-of-way line.

disturbance or nuisance to surrounding properties, residents or to the
community in general.
   119   The proposed project shall conform to all requirements and/or
conditions as the Planning Commission may deem necessary to meet the following
criteria:
      (1)   Vehicular approaches to the property shall be so designed as not to
create an interference with traffic on surrounding public streets or roads.
      (2)   Maximum possible privacy for each apartment shall be provided
through good design and use of proper building materials and landscaping. 
Visual privacy should be provided through structural screening and landscaping
treatment.  Auditory privacy should be provided through sound proofing.
      (3)   The architectural design of apartment buildings should be developed
with consideration given to the relationship of adjacent development in terms
of building height, mass, texture, line and pattern, and character.
      (4)   Building location and placement should be developed with
consideration given to minimizing removal of trees and change of topography.
      (5)   T.V. antenna shall be centralized.

in regard to an industrial operation whose effects on adjacent premises, the
area or the community are not readily known, the Commission may seek expert
advice on what conditions should be imposed on the particular industrial
operation to reasonably modify any injurious or offensive effects likely to
result from such an operation.  The cost of securing such expert assistance
shall be borne by the applicant.
   125   All structures and activity areas should be located at least 100 feet
from all property lines.
   126   Upon issuance of a conditional zoning certificate by the Planning
Commission stating the desire to vary individual lot sizes, varying individual
lots sizes may be permitted provided that the overall density requirements of
the zoning district or districts within which the project is located are not
exceeded.  The average net area of all lots within a variable lot size
development shall not be less than the minimum lot size within which the
development is located.
(Ord. 22-1972.  Passed 8-1-72.)
      (1)   Minimum lot sizes for variable density development shall be:
   R-1         12,000 sq. ft. with centralized sewer and water

(Ord. 21-05.  Passed 9-6-05.)
      (2)   Unless otherwise specified during subdivision review, minimum yard
and frontage requirements for each lot in a variable density development may be
reduced in proportion to the total reduction in lot size below the standard
zoning requirements for the zone in which the lot is located.
      (3)   Each variable lot size development shall consist of a minimum of
three acres.
   127   Upon issuance of a conditional zoning certificate by the Planning
Commission stating the desire to use flexible setbacks, the front yard setbacks
in a residential subdivision may be varied to allow an average setback of
thirty-five feet throughout such subdivision and meeting the following
requirements:
      (1)   The minimum front yard setback allowed will be twenty-five feet.
      (2)   The building setbacks of lots adjacent to existing structures must
conform to the setback of the existing structures except in the extension of an
existing flexible setback subdivision.
      (3)   The flexible setback option is applicable only to a platted
subdivision.
      (4)   Review of a flexible setback subdivision by the Planning Commission
will include consideration of the flexible setbacks as a condition for approval
of the subdivision.  Subdivision approval and flexible front yard setback
approval may take place concurrently.
      (5)   Upon approval of the flexible front yard setback, such setback
lines will be placed on the subdivision map and filed with the Zoning
Inspector.
      (6)   At the time of filing, the approved flexible front yard setback
lines will become binding to each lot as they appear on the final subdivision
map.
   128   Upon issuance of a conditional zoning certificate by the Planning
Commission stating the desire to develop a zero lot line subdivision, a
subdivision may be developed eliminating the side yard requirement and
permitting residential dwellings to be built on the side yard lot line of each
lot in a subdivision provided the following requirements are met:
      (1)   The zero lot line option is applicable only to a platted
subdivision.
      (2)   No part of the structure shall project into the adjacent yard.
      (3)   Each home in the subdivision will be placed as near the right or
left lot line as the furthest structural projection will permit.  The lot line
chosen will be adhered to around an entire block within the subdivision.
      (4)   Lots adjacent to existing structures are eligible for zero lot line
only if the lot line furthest from the existing structure is used.  If this is
not possible, the side yard restrictions of the zone or zones in which the
subdivision is being built must be adhered to for all those lots adjacent to
existing structures.  This does not apply to the extension of an existing zero
lot line subdivision.
      (5)   Review of a zero lot line subdivision by the Planning Commission
will include consideration of the zero lot line option as a condition for
approval of the subdivision.  Subdivision approval and zero lot line approval
may take place concurrently.
      (6)   Upon approval of the zero lot lines, such zero lot lines will be
placed on the subdivision map and filed with the Planning Commission.
      (7)   At the time of filing, the approved zero lot lines will become
binding to each lot as they appear on the final subdivision map.
      (8)   The entire subdivision must have an agreement of cooperation
between property owners granting permission to enter the property adjacent to
the zero lot lines for safety purposes and performance of necessary
maintenance.
   129   A mobile home for residential purposes may be permitted by the
Planning Commission under a conditional use permit subject to the following
purposes, requirements and conditions:
      (1)   For the purpose of providing housing in a mobile home for the
immediate members of the family residing in a dwelling already constructed on
the lot, and for the following circumstances only:
         (a)   In case of fire, flood, storm or any similar act of God which
destroys the present dwelling, a mobile home may be permitted for a period not
to exceed one year.
         (b)   For the purpose of permitting the immediate members of the
family to reside in a mobile home may be permitted for a period not to exceed
one year.
      (2)   All mobile homes shall have adequate health facilities including
running water and toilet facilities inside the mobile home connected to an
approved sanitary sewerage system.
      (3)   The required health facilities may be connected to available
approved facilities of a permanent residence or business.
      (4)   If no approved facilities are available, the same must be
established and must conform to the health requirements as regulated by the
Stark County General Health District.
      (5)   Only one mobile home may be permitted at any existing  residence
and it must be located in the rear yard directly in back of the permanent
residence and must conform to all yard setback requirements.
      (6)   Mobile homes shall have a maximum of 500 square feet of living
space.
      (7)   A permit shall be required for every mobile home and shall be for a
period not to exceed one year beginning at the time of issuance of such permit
and may be renewed annually upon approval by the Planning Commission and
subject to
Chapter 143.
   Should the emergency or hardship be relieved during the permit year, the
permit may be revoked after thirty days notice and the trailer must be
removed.  The proportion of the unused permit year shall be the basis for
return of permit fees charged for the total year.
   130   In areas adjoining the Flood Plain District lying at sea level
elevations between 952 and 957 feet, all residential, commercial, industrial
and public structures shall be floodproofed to prevent water damage to the
building and its contents.  The 957 foot elevation at the Market Street Bridge
marks the Standard Project Flood level which, according to the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers, is the highest conceivable flood in Canal Fulton, based on
meteorological and hydrological data for the Tuscarawas River Valley. 
Floodproofing and other flood protection measures should be allowed only upon
issuance of a special use permit by the Planning Commission.
      (1)   Residential Areas.  In residential structures the first floor
finished surface shall be above 957 feet (Standard Project Flood).  If placed
on fill, the fill shall be above 952 feet (Intermediate Regional Flood).  The
fill should extend at such elevation at least fifteen feet beyond the limits of
any structure or building erected thereon.
      (2)   Commercial Areas.  Commercial buildings or structures generally
should be raised with no first floor or nonfloodproofed portions of the
basement floor below the flood protection elevation.  Accessory land uses such
as yards, railroad tracks and parking lots may be at lower elevations. 
However, in the absence of an adequate local flood warning system, no area
should be designed for use by the public which would be inundated to a depth
greater than two feet or subjected to flood velocities greater than four feet
per second upon the occurrence of the regional flood.
      (3)   Manufacturing and Industrial Areas.  Manufacturing and industrial
buildings, structures and appurtenant works should be raised or floodproofed to
the flood protection elevation.  Measures should be taken to minimize
interference with normal plant operations especially for streams having
protracted flood durations.  Certain accessory land uses such as yards,
railroad tracks and parking lots may be at lower elevations.
      (4)   Public Utilities, Roads and Bridges.  Public utilities facilities,
roads, railroad tracks and bridges within the regulatory flood plain should be
designed to minimize increases in flood elevations and should be compatible
with existing local comprehensive flood plain development plans.  When failure
or interruption of these public facilities would result in danger to the public
health or safety or where such facilities are essential to the orderly
functioning of the area, elevating or floodproofing to the flood protection
elevation should be provided.  Where failure or interruption of service would
not endanger life or health, a lesser degree of protection may be provided for
minor or auxiliary roads, railroad tracks or utilities.  Any structure
constructed by State agencies or local units of government should comply with
the regulations.
      (5)   Storage of Materials.  Material that, in time of flooding, are
buoyant, flammable, explosive or could be injurious to human, animal or plant
life should be stored at or above the flood protection elevation, floodproofed,

(Ord. 22-72.  Passed 8-1-72.)
1147.08  POWERS AND DUTIES.
   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the following powers:
   (a)   The Board shall have the power to hear and decide appeals where it is

made by the Zoning Inspector in the enforcement of this Zoning Ordinance.
(Ord. 22-72.  Passed 8-1-72.)
   (b)   The Board shall have the power to authorize, upon appeal, in specific
cases, such variances from the terms of the zoning ordinances as will not be
contrary to the public interest.
      (1)   In requests for variances involving only matters of area, the
applicant must demonstrate that he has encountered practical difficulties in
the use of this property.  Practical difficulties include but are not limited
to:
         A.   Whether the property in question will yield a reasonable return
or whether there can be any beneficial use of the property without the
variance;
         B.   Whether the variance is substantial;
         C.   Whether the essential character of the neighborhood would be
substantially altered or whether adjoining properties would suffer a
substantial detriment as a result of the variance;
         D.   Whether the variance would adversely affect the delivery of
governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, garbage);
         E.   Whether the property owner purchased the property with knowledge
of the zoning restriction;
         F.   Whether the property owner's predicament feasibly can be obviated
through some method other than a variance;
         G.   Whether the spirit and intent behind the zoning requirement would
be observed and substantial justice done by granting the variance.
      (2)   In all other variances, the applicant must demonstrate that a
literal enforcement of the zoning ordinance will result in unnecessary
hardship, and that the spirit of this Zoning Ordinance would be observed and
substantial justice done.
         In granting a variance, the Board may impose such conditions as it may
deem necessary to protect the public health, safety and morals and in
furtherance of the purposes and intent of this Zoning Ordinance.

original jurisdiction.  Such appeals shall be taken within twenty days after
the decision.  The appellant shall post security for the cost of all action
required for the hearing of the appeal.  An appeals shall stay all proceedings

would, in his opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property.  In such
cases, proceedings shall not be stayed by other than a restraining order
granted by the Board or by a court having lawful jurisdiction.  Within its
powers, the Board may reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or modify the
order, requirement, decision or determination as in its opinion ought to be

approve, or disapprove the proposal, and if approved, shall refer the proposal
with a copy of its report and recommendation to City Council.
   (c)   Commission Review Without Owner's Consent.  In the case of any
proposed Historic district, and in the case of a proposed historic landmark
site where the owner of the site nominated for designation does not consent to
the review, the Commission shall hold a public hearing on the proposal not more
than sixty days after the filing of the application.
      (1)   Notice of public hearing shall be in accordance with this Code's
public notice requirements, except that notice by first class mail to property
owners within 300 feet of the property in question shall not be required.  In
lieu thereof, the Commission shall mail written notices of the hearing to the
owners of all the sites included in the proposed designation.  In addition, in
cases of nomination by fewer than all of the owners of the property, notice
shall be mailed at least ten days prior to the hearing date to the owners of
all property included in the proposed designation.  Failure to send notice by
mail to any such owner where the address of such owner is unknown and not a
matter of public record shall not invalidate any proceedings in connection with
the proposed designation.
      (2)   Commission shall review the application for conformance of the
proposed designation with the established criteria for designation and the
standards of this section within sixty days after the conclusion of the public
hearing.  The Commission shall either approve, modify and approve, or
disapprove the proposal, and if approved, shall refer the proposal with a copy
of its report and recommendation to City Council.

1153.01  STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION.
   Article XVIII, Section 3, of the Ohio Constitution grants municipalities the
legal authority to adopt land use and control measures for promoting the
health, safety, and general welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the City
Council of Canal Fulton, State of Ohio, does ordain as follows in this chapter.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.02  FINDINGS OF FACT.
   The City of Canal Fulton has special flood hazard areas that are subject to
periodic inundation which may result in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary
public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax
base.  Additionally, structures that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed,
or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. In
order to minimize the threat of such damages and to achieve the purposes
hereinafter set forth, these regulations are adopted.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.03  STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.
   It is the purpose of these regulations to promote the public health, safety
and general welfare, and to:
   (a)   Protect human life and health;
   (b)   Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control
projects;
   (c)   Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with
flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
   (d)   Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
   (e)   Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and
gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in
areas of special flood hazard;
   (f)   Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the proper use and
development of areas of special flood hazard so as to protect property and
minimize future flood blight areas;
   (g)   Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions;
   (h)   Minimize the impact of development on adjacent properties within and
near flood prone areas;
   (i)   Ensure that the flood storage and conveyance functions of the
floodplain are maintained;
   (j)   Minimize the impact of development on the natural, beneficial values
of the floodplain;
   (k)   Prevent floodplain uses that are either hazardous or environmentally
incompatible; and
   (l)   Meet community participation requirements of the National Flood
Insurance Program.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.04  METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSS.
   In order to accomplish its purposes, these regulations include methods and
provisions for:
   (a)   Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety,
and property due to water hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
flood heights or velocities;
   (b)   Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which
serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
   (c)   Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels,
and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood
waters;
   (d)   Controlling filling, grading, dredging, excavating, and other
development which may increase flood damage; and,
   (e)   Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers, which
will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in
other areas.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.05  LANDS TO WHICH THESE REGULATIONS APPLY.
   These regulations shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard within
the jurisdiction of the City as identified in Section
1153.06, including any additional areas of special flood hazard annexed by the
City.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.06  BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING THE AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD.
   (a)   For the purposes of these regulations, the following studies and /or
maps are adopted:
      (1)   Flood Insurance Study Stark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas and
Flood Insurance Rate Map Stark County, Ohio and Incorporated Areas, both
effective September 29, 2011.
      (2)   Other studies and /or maps, which may be relied upon for
establishment of the flood protection elevation, delineation of the 100-year
floodplain, floodways or delineation of other areas of special flood hazard.
      (3)   Any hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis authored by a
registered Professional Engineer in the State of Ohio which has been approved
by the City of Canal Fulton as required by Section
1153.26 Subdivisions and Large Scale Developments.
   (b)   Any revisions to the aforementioned maps and /or studies are hereby
adopted by reference and declared to be a part of these regulations. Such maps
and/or studies are on file at the Clerk of Council's Office, 155 East Market
Street, Canal Fulton, Ohio.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.07  ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS.
   These regulations are not intended to repeal any existing ordinances
including subdivision regulations, zoning or building codes. In the event of a
conflict between these regulations and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall be followed. These regulations shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement but the land subject to such interests shall
also be governed by the regulations.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.08  INTERPRETATION.
   In the interpretation and application of these regulations, all provisions
shall be:
   (a)   Considered as minimum requirements;
   (b)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and,
   (c)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under
state statutes. Where a provision of these regulations may be in conflict with
a state or Federal law, such state or Federal law shall take precedence over
these regulations.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.09  WARNING AND DISCLAIMER OF LIABILITY.
   The degree of flood protection required by these regulations is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering
considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood
heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. These regulations do
not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted
within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damage. These regulations
shall not create liability on the part of the City, any officer or employee
thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damage that
results from reliance on these regulations or any administrative decision
lawfully made thereunder.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.10  SEVERABILITY.
   Should any section or provision of these regulations be declared by the
courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the
validity of the regulations as a whole, or any part thereof other than the part
so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.11  DEFINITIONS.
   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in these
regulations shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give these regulations the most reasonable application.
   (a)   “Accessory structure.”  A structure on the same lot with, and of a
nature customarily incidental and subordinate to, the principal structure.
   (b)   “Appeal.” A request for review of the floodplain administrator's
interpretation of any provision of these regulations or a request for a
variance.
   (c)   “Base flood.”  The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood may also be referred to
as the one percent (1%) chance annual flood or one-hundred (100) year flood.
   (d)   “Base (100-year) flood elevation (BFE).”  The water surface elevation
of the base flood in relation to a specified datum, usually the National
Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 or the North American Vertical Datum of 1988,

storage of equipment or materials.
   (g)   “Enclosure below the lowest floor.”  See “Lowest Floor.”
   (h)   “Executive Order 11988 (Floodplain Management).”  Issued by President
Carter in 1977, this order requires that no federally assisted activities be
conducted in or have the potential to affect identified special flood hazard
areas, unless there is no practicable alternative.
   (i)   “Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA).”  The agency with the
overall responsibility for administering the National Flood Insurance Program.
   (j)   “Fill.”  A deposit of earth material placed by artificial means.
   (k)   “Flood” or “Flooding.”  A general and temporary condition of partial
or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from:
      (1)   The overflow of inland or tidal waters, and/or
      (2)   The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from
any source.
   (l)   “Flood hazard boundary map (FHBM).”  Usually the initial map, produced
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or U.S. Department of Housing and
Urban Development, for a community depicting approximate special flood hazard
areas.
   (m)   “Flood insurance rate map (FIRM).”  An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has delineated the areas of special flood hazard.
   (n)   “Flood insurance risk zones.”  Zone designations on FHBMs and FIRMs
that indicate the magnitude of the flood hazard in specific areas of a
community. Following are the zone definitions:
      (1)   Zone A. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood; base flood elevations are not determined.
      (2)   Zones A1-30 and Zone AE. Special flood hazard areas inundated by
the one hundred (100)-year flood; base flood elevations are determined.
      (3)   Zone AO. Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood; with flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually sheet flow on
sloping terrain); average depths are determined.
      (4)   Zone AH.  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood; flood depths of 1 to 3 feet (usually areas of ponding); base
flood elevations are determined.
      (5)   Zone A99.  Special flood hazard areas inundated by the one hundred
(100)-year flood to be protected from the one hundred (100)-year flood by a
Federal flood protection system under construction; no base flood elevations
are determined.
      (6)   Zone B and Zone X (shaded). Areas of five hundred (500)-year flood;
areas subject to the one hundred (100)-year flood with average depths of less
than one (1) foot or with contributing drainage area less than one (1) square
mile; and areas protected by levees from the base flood.
      (7)   Zone C and Zone X (unshaded).  Areas determined to be outside the
five hundred (500)-year floodplain.
   (o)   “Flood Insurance Study (FIS).”  The official report in which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency or the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban
Development has provided flood profiles, floodway boundaries (sometimes shown
on flood boundary and floodway maps), and the water surface elevations of the
base flood.
   (p)   “Flood Protection Elevation.” The Flood Protection Elevation, or FPE,
is the base flood elevation plus two (2) feet of freeboard. In areas where no
base flood elevations exist from any authoritative source, the flood protection
elevation can be historical flood elevations, or base flood elevations
determined and/or approved by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (q)   “Floodway.”  A floodway is the channel of a river or other watercourse
and the adjacent land areas that have been reserved in order to pass the base
flood discharge. A floodway is typically determined through a hydraulic and
hydrologic engineering analysis such that the cumulative increase in the water
surface elevation of the base flood discharge is no more than a designated
height. In no case shall the designated height be more than one (1) foot at any
point within the community. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area, and is
usually characterized by any of the following: Moderate to high velocity flood
waters, high potential for debris and projectile impacts, and moderate to high
erosion forces.
   (r)   “Freeboard.”  A factor of safety usually expressed in feet above a
flood level for the purposes of floodplain management. Freeboard tends to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood heights
greater than the height calculated for a selected size flood and floodway
conditions, such as wave action, obstructed bridge openings, debris and ice
jams, and the hydrologic effect of urbanization in a watershed.
   (s)   “Historic structure.”  Any structure that is:
      (1)   Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a
listing maintained by the U.S. Department of Interior) or preliminarily
determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for
individual listings on the National Register;
      (2)   Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the
Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered
historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to
qualify as a registered historic district; or
      (3)   Individually listed on the State of Ohio's inventory of historic
places maintained by the Ohio Historic Preservation Office.
   (t)   “Hydrologic and hydraulic engineering analysis.” An analysis performed
by a professional engineer, registered in the State of Ohio, in accordance with
standard engineering practices as accepted by FEMA, used to determine flood
elevations and/or floodway boundaries.
   (u)   “Letter of map change (LOMC).”  A letter of map change is an official
FEMA determination, by letter, to amend or revise effective flood insurance
rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps, and flood insurance studies. LOMCs
are broken down into the following categories:
      (1)   “Letter of map amendment (LOMA).” A revision based on technical
data showing that a property was incorrectly included in a designated special
flood hazard area. A LOMA amends the current effective flood insurance rate map
and establishes that a specific property is not located in a special flood
hazard area.
      (2)   “Letter of map revision (LOMR).”  A revision based on technical
data that, usually due to manmade changes, shows changes to flood zones, flood
elevations, floodplain and floodway delineations, and planimetric features. One
common type of LOMR, a LOMR-F, is a determination concerning whether a
structure or parcel has been elevated by fill above the base flood elevation
and is, therefore, excluded from the special flood hazard area.
      (3)   “Conditional letter of map revision (CLOMR).”  A formal review and
comment by FEMA as to whether a proposed project complies with the minimum
national flood insurance program floodplain management criteria. A CLOMR does
not amend or revise effective flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and
floodway maps, or flood insurance studies.
   (v)   “Lowest floor.”  The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area
(including basement) of a structure. This definition excludes an “enclosure
below the lowest floor” which is an unfinished or flood resistant enclosure
usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, in an area
other than a basement area, provided that such enclosure is built in accordance
with the applicable design requirements specified in these regulations for
enclosures below the lowest floor.
   (w)   “Manufactured home.”  A structure, transportable in one or more
sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or
without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. The
term “manufactured home” does not include a “recreational vehicle.”  For the
purposes of these regulations, a manufactured home includes manufactured homes
and mobile homes as defined in Chapter 3733 of the Ohio Revised Code.
   (x)   “Manufactured home park.”  As specified in the Ohio Administrative
Code 3701-27-01, a manufactured home park means any tract of land upon which
three or more manufactured homes, used for habitation are parked, either free
of charge or for revenue purposes, and includes any roadway, building,
structure, vehicle, or enclosure used or intended for use as part of the
facilities of the park. A tract of land that is subdivided and the individual
lots are not for rent or rented, but are for sale or sold for the purpose of
installation of manufactured homes on the lots, is not a manufactured home
park, even though three or more manufactured homes are parked thereon, if the
roadways are dedicated to the local government authority.
   (y)   “National flood insurance program (NFIP).” The NFIP is a federal
program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase
insurance protection against losses from flooding. This insurance is designed
to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the
escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by
floods. Participation in the NFIP is based on an agreement between local
communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt
and enforce floodplain management regulations to reduce future flood risks to
all development in special flood hazard areas, the federal government will make
flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection
against flood loss.
   (z)   “New construction.”  Structures for which the “start of construction”
commenced on or after the initial effective date of the City of Canal Fulton
Flood Insurance Rate Map, July 5, 1982, and includes any subsequent
improvements to such structures.
   (aa)   “Person.”  Includes any individual or group of individuals,
corporation, partnership, association, or any other entity, including state and
local governments and agencies. An agency is further defined in the Ohio R.C.
111.15 as any governmental entity of the state and includes, but is not limited
to, any board, department, division, commission, bureau, society, council,
institution, state college or university, community college district, technical
college district, or state community college. “Agency” does not include the
general assembly, the controlling board, the adjutant general's department, or
any court.
   (bb)   “Recreational vehicle.”  A vehicle which is:
      (1)   Built on a single chassis,
      (2)   400 square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal
projection,
      (3)   Designed to be self- propelled or permanently towable by a light
duty truck, and
      (4)   Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as
temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use.
   (cc)   “Registered professional architect.”  A person registered to engage
in the practice of architecture under the provisions of Ohio R.C. 4703.01 to
4703.19.
   (dd)   “Registered professional engineer.”  A person registered as a
professional engineer under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ee)   “Registered professional surveyor.”  A person registered as a
professional surveyor under Ohio R.C. Chapter 4733.
   (ff)   “Special flood hazard area.”  Also known as “areas of special flood
hazard,” it is the land in the floodplain subject to a one percent (1%) or
greater chance of flooding in any given year. Special flood hazard areas are
designated by the Federal Emergency Management Agency on flood insurance rate
maps, flood insurance studies, flood boundary and floodway maps and flood
hazard boundary maps as zones A, AE, AH, AO, Al-30, and A99. Special flood

inundation areas, and flood prone soils associated with a watercourse.
   (gg)   “Start of construction.”  The date the building permit was issued,
provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction,
rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days
of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or
footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work
beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as
clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets
and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings,
piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include
the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or
sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a
substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first
alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building,
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of a building.
   (hh)   “Structure.”  A walled and roofed building, manufactured home, or gas
or liquid storage tank that is principally above ground.
   (ii)   “Substantial damage.”  Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition
would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
before the damage occurred.
   (jj)   “Substantial improvement.”  Any reconstruction, rehabilitation,
addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or
exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the
“start of construction” of the improvement. This term includes structures,
which have incurred “substantial damage,” regardless of the actual repair work
performed. The term does not, however, include:
      (1)   Any improvement to a structure that is considered “new
construction,”
      (2)   Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications
which have been identified prior to the application for a development permit by
the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to
assure safe living conditions; or
      (3)   Any alteration of a “historic structure,” provided that the
alteration would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a
“historic structure.”
   (kk)   “Variance.”  A grant of relief from the standards of these
regulations consistent with the variance conditions herein.
   (ll)   “Violation.”  The failure of a structure or other development to be
fully compliant with these regulations.

floodway data have not been identified, the Floodplain Administrator shall
review and reasonably utilize any other flood hazard data available from a
federal, state, or other source.
   (b)   Base flood elevations and floodway boundaries produced on FEMA flood
maps and studies shall take precedence over base flood elevations and floodway
boundaries by any other source that reflect a reduced floodway width and/or
lower base flood elevations. Other sources of data, showing increased base
flood elevations and/or larger floodway areas than are shown on FEMA flood maps
and studies, shall be reasonably used by the Floodplain Administrator.
   (c)   When preliminary flood insurance rate maps and/or flood insurance
study have been provided by FEMA:
      (1)   Upon the issuance of a letter of final determination by the FEMA,
the preliminary flood hazard data shall be used and replace all previously
existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA for the purposes of administering
these regulations.
      (2)   Prior to the issuance of a letter of final determination by FEMA,
the use of preliminary flood hazard data shall only be required where no base
flood elevations and/or floodway areas exist or where the preliminary base
flood elevations or floodway area exceed the base flood elevations and/or
floodway widths in existing flood hazard data provided from FEMA. Such
preliminary data may be subject to change and /or appeal to FEMA.
   (d)   The Floodplain Administrator shall make interpretations, where needed,
as to the exact location of the flood boundaries and areas of special flood
hazard. A person contesting the determination of the location of the boundary
shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as
provided in Sections
1153.33 through
1153.38, Appeals and Variances.
   (e)   Where a map boundary showing an area of special flood hazard and field
elevations disagree, the base flood elevations or flood protection elevations
(as found on an elevation profile, floodway data table, established high water
marks, etc.) shall prevail.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.23   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE DETERMINATIONS.
   (a)   Damages to structures may result from a variety of causes including
flood, tornado, wind, heavy snow, fire, etc. After such a damage event, the
Floodplain Administrator shall:
      (1)   Determine whether damaged structures are located in special flood
hazard areas;
      (2)   Conduct substantial damage determinations for damaged structures
located in special flood hazard areas; and
      (3)   Make reasonable attempt to notify owners of substantially damaged
structures of the need to obtain a floodplain development permit prior to
repair, rehabilitation, or reconstruction.
   (b)   Additionally, the Floodplain Administrator may implement other
measures to assist with the substantial damage determination and subsequent
repair process. These measures include issuing press releases, public service
announcements, and other public information materials related to the floodplain
development permits and repair of damaged structures; coordinating with other
federal, state, and local agencies to assist with substantial damage
determinations; providing owners of damaged structures materials and other
information related to the proper repair of damaged structures in special flood

stage.” The field determination of “bankfull stage” shall be based on methods
presented in Chapter 7 of the USDA Forest Service General Technical Report RM-
245, Stream Channel Reference Sites: An Illustrated Guide to Field Technique or
other applicable publication available from a Federal, State, or other
authoritative source. For all proposed developments that alter a watercourse,
the following standards apply:
      (1)   The bankfull flood carrying capacity of the altered or relocated
portion of the watercourse shall not be diminished. Prior to the issuance of a
floodplain development permit, the applicant must submit a description of the
extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of the
proposed development, and certification by a registered professional engineer
that the bankfull flood carrying capacity of the watercourse will not be
diminished.
      (2)   Adjacent communities, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, and the
Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Water, must be notified prior
to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. Evidence of such notification
must be submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency.
      (3)   The applicant shall be responsible for providing the necessary
maintenance for the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that
the flood carrying capacity will not be diminished. The Floodplain
Administrator may require the permit holder to enter into an agreement with
Canal Fulton specifying the maintenance responsibilities. If an agreement is
required, it shall be made a condition of the floodplain development permit.
      (4)   The applicant shall meet the requirements to submit technical data
in Section
1153.21(a)(1)C. when an alteration of a watercourse results in the relocation
or elimination of the special flood hazard area, including the placement of
culverts.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.33   APPEALS BOARD ESTABLISHED.
   (a)   The City of Canal Fulton Planning Commission is hereby appointed to

Council's Office 155 East Market Street, Canal Fulton, Ohio.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)

regulations.
   (b)   Authorize variances in accordance with Section
1153.36 of these regulations.

of the Floodplain Administrator may request and shall be granted a hearing on
the matter before the Appeals Board provided that such person shall file,
within thirty (30) days of the date of such notice and order, or other official
action, a brief statement of the grounds for such hearing or for the mitigation
of any item appearing on any order of the Floodplain Administrator's decision.
Such appeal shall be in writing, signed by the applicant, and be filed with the
Floodplain Administrator. Upon receipt of the appeal, the Floodplain
Administrator shall transmit said notice and all pertinent information on which
the Floodplain Administrator's decision was made to the Appeals Board.
   (b)   Upon receipt of the notice of appeal, the Appeals Board shall fix a
reasonable time for the appeal, give notice in writing to parties in interest,
and decide the appeal within a reasonable time after it is submitted.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.36  VARIANCES.
   Any person believing that the use and development standards of these
regulations would result in unnecessary hardship may file an application for a
variance. The Appeals Board shall have the power to authorize, in specific
cases, such variances from the standards of these regulations, not inconsistent
with federal regulations, as will not be contrary to the public interest where,
owing to special conditions of the lot or parcel, a literal enforcement of the
provisions of these regulations would result in unnecessary hardship.
   (a)   Application for a variance.
      (1)   Any owner, or agent thereof, of property for which a variance is
sought shall make an application for a variance by filing it with the
Floodplain Administrator, who upon receipt of the variance shall transmit it to
the Appeals Board.
      (2)   Such application at a minimum shall contain the following
information: Name, address, and telephone number of the applicant; legal
description of the property; parcel map; description of the existing use;
description of the proposed use; location of the floodplain; description of the
variance sought; and reason for the variance request.
      (3)   All applications for a variance shall be accompanied by a variance
application fee set in the schedule of fees adopted by the City of Canal
Fulton.
   (b)   Public hearing.  At such hearing the applicant shall present such
statements and evidence as the Appeals Board requires. In considering such
variance applications, the Appeals Board shall consider and make findings of
fact on all evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other
sections of these regulations and the following factors:
      (1)   The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the
injury of others.
      (2)   The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage.
      (3)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to
flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner.
      (4)   The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to
the community.
      (5)   The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use that
are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.
      (6)   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where
applicable.
      (7)   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated
development.
      (8)   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and
floodplain management program for that area.
      (9)   The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary
and emergency vehicles.
      (10)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and
sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if
applicable, expected at the site.
      (11)   The costs of providing governmental services during and after
flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and
bridges.
   (c)   (1)   Variances shall only be issued upon:
         A.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.
         B.   A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the property.
Increased cost or inconvenience of meeting the requirements of these
regulations does not constitute an exceptional hardship to the applicant.
   C.   A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights beyond that which is allowed in these regulations;
additional threats to public safety; extraordinary public expense, nuisances,
fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws.
         D.   A determination that the structure or other development is
protected by methods to minimize flood damages.
         E.   A determination that the variance is the minimum necessary,
considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
      (2)   Upon consideration of the above factors and the purposes of these
regulations, the Appeals Board may attach such conditions to the granting of
variances, as it deems necessary to further the purposes of these regulations.
   (d)   Other conditions for variances.
      (1)   Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any
increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.
      (2)   Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in
size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level, providing items in Section
1153.36(b)(1) to (11) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases
beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the
variance increases.
      (3)   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor
elevation below the base flood elevation and the cost of flood insurance will
be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation.
(Ord. 23-11.  Passed 9-6-11.)
1153.37  PROCEDURE AT HEARINGS.
   (a)   All testimony shall be given under oath.
   (b)   A complete record of the proceedings shall be kept, except
confidential deliberations of the Board, but including all documents presented
and a verbatim record of the testimony of all witnesses.
   (c)   The applicant shall proceed first to present evidence and testimony in
support of the appeal or variance.

the appeal or variance.

attendance of witnesses. A reasonable deposit to cover the cost of issuance and
service shall be collected in advance.
   (h)   The Board shall prepare conclusions of fact supporting its decision.
The decision may be announced at the conclusion of the hearing and thereafter
issued in writing or the decision may be issued in writing within a reasonable
time after the hearing.

decision to the Stark County Court of Common Pleas, as provided in Ohio R.C.
Chapter 2506.

1175.01  PURPOSE.
   In order to promote the economic and general welfare of the people of the
City and of the public generally, and to insure the harmonious, orderly and
efficient growth and development of the City, it is deemed to be essential by

being the continued existence and preservation of historic areas and buildings;
continued construction of buildings in historic styles and general harmony as
to style, form, color, proportion, texture and material between buildings of
historic design and those of more modern design; that such purpose is advanced
through the preservation and protection of the old historic or architecturally
worthy structures and quaint neighborhoods which serve as visible reminders of
the historical and cultural heritage of the City, the State of Ohio and the
Nation.  Parking is an essential concern for the on going economic vitality of
the Historic District and should be of primary concern.

      (9)   After the Historic Preservation Commission proposes a designation
(s) of any area, place, building, or structure as a landmark, it will take the
following actions:
         A.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall advise the Planning
Commission of the proposed designation and secure from the Planning Commission
its opinion and recommendation as to any other planning consideration which may
be relevant to the proposed designation, together with its recommendation of
approval, rejection or modification of the proposed designation.  The
recommendation shall become part of the official record concerning the proposed
designation and shall be submitted by the Historic Preservation Commission

Commission may make such modifications, changes and alterations concerning the
proposed designation as it deems necessary in consideration of the
recommendation by the Planning Commission.
         B.   The Historic Preservation Commission shall thereafter notify the
owner of such property of the proposed designation.  Whenever possible, the
Commission shall secure the owner's written consent or submittal of the
proposed designation, together with its recommendation and findings of fact, to
Council.  In the event that the owner refuses or declines to give his written
consent to the proposed designation, the Commission shall schedule a public
hearing on the question of the proposed designation, setting forth a date, time
and place and causing written notice to be given to the owner or any persons
having a legal or equitable interest in the property being proposed for
designation. The Commission shall cause a legal notice to be published in a
newspaper of general circulation in the City setting forth the nature of the
hearing, the property involved and the date, time and place of the scheduled
public hearing.
         C.   The Commission shall conduct the public hearing and provide a
reasonable opportunity for all interested parties to express their opinions
under such rules as the Commission may adopt for the purpose of governing the
proceedings of the hearings. Each speaker shall be fully identified as to name,
address and the interests which he represents.  The Commission shall make a
determination with respect to the proposed designation in writing within thirty
days after the initial hearing date and shall notify any owner or any person
having a legal or equitable interest in the property, as well as such other
interested parties as may request a copy thereof.  The Commission shall set
forth in its recommendation such findings of fact which constitute the basis
for its decision and shall transmit the recommendation concerning the proposed
designation to Council.
         D.   City Council shall give due consideration to the findings and
recommendations of the Commission, as well as such views as may have been
expressed by persons participating in the hearing before the Commission, in
addition to the recommendation of the Planning Commission, in making its
determination with respect to the proposed designation of any areas, places,
buildings, or structures as landmarks.  Council may, in its discretion, hold
public hearings on any such proposed designation, whether designation is

(Ord. 11-03.  Passed 4-1-03.)
1175.05  CRITERIA FOR APPROPRIATENESS.
   The following are criteria to be used in evaluating appropriateness of
structures and/or alterations of such structures within the Historic District.
   (a)   Spacing.
      (1)   "Lot coverage" is the percentage of lot area covered by the primary
structure; building to lot coverage provides an important component of building
spacing by being a measure of the density of developed land along each block
front and on each lot.  New construction should have a lot coverage similar to
those of existing buildings in the area.  For example, compare:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bf6eb727091284fb24578cca1d215f719b0a84c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2785.jpg]
 
      (2)   "Setback" is the distance from the edge of the right of way to the
building front.  Uniformity of front yard setback establishes a framework of
order and coherence, and insures a strong and continuous streetscape. 
Consistency of setback is an especially important unifying factor where
building styles vary.  For example, compare:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bf6eb727091284fb24578cca1d215f719b0a84c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2788.jpg]
 
      (3)   "Building height" is the distance from the average finished grade
at its intersection with the front of the building to the highest point of the
building.  Consistency of height is an important factor contributing to the
scale and character of an area.  Buildings quite different from the predominate
pattern of an area will disrupt the area's structural relatedness.  It should
be realized that the perceived height frequently differs from actual height. 
The perceived height is a product of the number of stories, the relationship of
height and width, the height of porches, and other visual factors.  The actual
height depends mainly on the height of each story and pitch of the roof.  Both
measurements of height should be considered.  For example, compare:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bf6eb727091284fb24578cca1d215f719b0a84c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2791.jpg]
 
      (4)   "Spacing of buildings" refers to the distance between adjacent
buildings.  Closely spaced buildings have a strong spatial tension, or
attraction between them, while buildings distant from each other have little
force of attraction.  Additionally, regular patterns of spacing convey a sense
of order and cohesion; regularity of rhythm adds strength and continuity to the
streetscape for an observer moving along a street.  The spacing of buildings
will be affected by the minimum side yard requirements in the Zoning
Ordinance.  For example, compare:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bf6eb727091284fb24578cca1d215f719b0a84c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2794.jpg]
 
   (b)   Architectural Design Components.  "Architectural design components"
refers to aspects of the design of each individual building.  These components
must be compatible within the building as a unit as well as with the
buildings's surroundings.  Design components help provide a sense of unity and
coherence within the historic area.
      (1)   Exterior building and roofing materials.  The dominant building
material for a particular streetscape may be brick or wood siding for example;
or the dominant roofing material may be asbestos shingles or tin.  A mixture of
materials adds variety to an area, but a degree of variety which becomes
chaotic should be avoided.  Ideally, materials used in new construction or
remodeling should exhibit an affinity with existing materials in the area. 
Additionally, some buildings and roofing materials (such as artificial brick or
stone siding) may be inappropriate for the style or character of existing
buildings; the use of such materials in remodeling should be discouraged.
      (2)   Exterior texture effects result from the nature of the materials
used, such as the horizontal regularity of wood siding, or the roughness of
brick with tooled joints.  Texture may also result from the repetition of
architectural details, such as porch balustrades.  New buildings using textured
materials or details are less obtrusive in old areas of finely scaled detail.
      (3)   Proportion of width to height of openings.  This proportion of
width to height applies to openings within the facade, such as doors and
windows.  In a sequence of buildings, the use of similarly proportioned
openings will help establish the relatedness of structures.  Openings which
vary significantly from that which exists in surrounding buildings may have a
disruptive effect on the character of an area.  For example, compare:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bf6eb727091284fb24578cca1d215f719b0a84c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2797.jpg]
 
      (4)   Architectural styles.  Use of forms which are especially indigenous
to the area, such as porches or cupolas, should be encouraged in order to
enhance the elements which contribute to the distinctive character of the
district.  Motifs in detailing which are prevalent in the district, such as
certain stained glass forms or types of bracketing, should be retained whenever
possible for their continued contribution to the area's unique qualities.
      (5)   Roof form and pitch in relation to facade.  Roof forms in a given
streetscape may be gable, hip, gambrel, mansard or flat, and pitches may vary. 
Roof forms and pitches should be in harmony with the predominant type in the
neighborhood.  For example, compare:
[https://export.amlegal.com/media/bf6eb727091284fb24578cca1d215f719b0a84c2/
IMAGES/0-0-0-2800.jpg]
 
      (6)   Shape and form of the building.  The basic shape and form of the
facades of new structures or additions should be compatible with facades'
shapes and forms already existing in the area.  Facades with highly or
unorthodox shapes and forms may not be in harmony with existing structures, and
they may call undue amounts of attention to themselves.  Similar consideration
should likewise be given to the shape and form of the building as a whole. 
Construction of additions and appendages should follow the guidelines under
subsection (b) hereof, so that they will respect the original design in the use
of materials and details, as well as shape and form.  (However, it must be
recognized that "Victorian" architecture delighted in unusual shapes and forms
and asymmetry.  Victorian houses may have polygonal bays, turrets, unusual
gables, and oddly placed windows.  "Unusual" additions to such structures may
be entirely compatible with the original design and may fit well in the
neighborhood, if they are thoughtfully designed.)
      (7)   Architectural detailing.  Details such as lintels, stained glass,
foundation materials and chimneys give a building or set of buildings an
identity and distinctive character.  Older buildings in particular tend to
display a very fine level of detail.  New construction should seek to reflect
the level of detail in an area; blank facades introduced into an area of
detailed buildings will disrupt the quality of design.
      (8)   Color.  Appropriate paint colors should be recommended for each
building according to the age and architecture represented.  The colors of
adjacent buildings, as well as the streetscape in general, should be taken into
account.  It might be decided, for instance, that where red is an appropriate
color based upon the age and architecture of the building, it might still be
preferable to decide in favor of gray because of colors of the adjacent
structures and the general streetscape.
         When the concern is with new construction in a preservation district,
care should be taken to avoid colors of contemporary origin that clash or
loudly contrast with the older colors.  Earth shades are preferable for new
construction, or colors which predominate in the surrounding older buildings so
as to minimize the impact of any conflict in design.
         It should be noted here that excellent contemporary architecture is
not in conflict with the concept of a preservation district.  It is only
necessary that due consideration is given to the spirit and atmosphere of the
immediate area.
         Color choices will be conditioned upon the areas of color surfaces
involved, the material to be affected and the issue of building color versus
signage or accent color.  No prior draft of rules can possibly determine color
appropriateness in all areas.
   (c)   Signage.  The existing articles of the Zoning Ordinance dealing with
signage would apply to the Historic District with the additional guidelines.
      (1)   The signage for a particular building or shop be reduced to the
fewest separate panels and/or statements possible.  The description of goods or
services beyond the basic statement of the nature of the business, should be
restricted.  Example:  "The Old World Delicatessen" would not be followed with
the usual "wine, pop, cola, beer and party mixes sold here".  Any owner has the
right to place signage within the shop window to more fully elaborate on his
goods, providing the signs are not contrary to the intent of the total signage
criteria.  (See subsection (c)(5) hereof.)
      (2)   Most buildings are designed with a definite panel or framed zone
for the sign mounting.  This should be used with the sign taking a
complimentary shape.
      (3)   Letter styles are many.  Keep to one, or at most two, styles or
faces at each shop.  This enhances readability as well as creates a more
dependable "logo" for the shop.
      (4)   Colors are a highly subjective item.  Colors should be highly
compatible within the sign itself and should correlate with the building
colors.  Bizarre color combinations intended to shock the eye should be
restricted as being incompatible with the streetscape.  Good contrast is
essential for distant readability.  Some established logos will warrant
recognition.
      (5)   Material used can be a variable, but natural looking materials are
desirable.
      (6)   Excellent signs already in place would be cited as a guide for
future sign-making petitioners.  A body of sign photos or drawings from
elsewhere can be used as preliminary guidelines.
      (7)   Signage needed for public instruction should be the subject of a
special program and assignment wherein all existing signage (locational,
directional, instructive) be reviewed for effective size, placement and
message.  A new consistent logo and letter style should be developed and put to
use in future sign replacement.  The culminating design should reflect
excellence of letter design - clear and vigorous, not whimsical.
      (8)   Signage need not always be externally fixed on a building.  The
fine art of lettering on glass, once very common, deserves a comeback and would
be a sound solution.  Projecting signs can be highly successful if thoughtfully
styled and scaled to avoid either a heavy or a trivial appearance.  The goal is
to match sign with building or product and to do so within reasonable limits of
size and placement and with compatibility with the streetscape.
      (9)   It is further recommended that no signage of commercial nature be
erected in the right of way or tree lawn.  Vistas up and down the street are
injured by such pole or stem-mounted signs, especially where excellent tree
forms cover the message in the first place.  Projecting signs are not out of
place when formally attached to the building facade, but their size becomes
critical to avoid blocking the view of the buildings beyond.
(Ord. 20-1978.  Passed 9-19-78.)
1175.051  SECOND SIGNS.
   In the spirit of historic preservation and the beautification of the canal
corridor, the Historic Preservation Commission may authorize the Zoning
Inspector to issue a permit for a second sign to be attached to a building in
the following circumstances:
   (a)   The second sign must be a part of a building beautification project
that enhances the objectives of the Historic Preservation Commission.
   (b)   The second sign shall not exceed the size of the sign approved for the
front of the building or twenty square feet whichever is smaller.
   (c)   A second sign may be permitted only when the back of the building
faces the canal or the building has frontage on two streets.
   (d)   A certificate of appropriateness must be issued as provided in this
chapter.
   (e)   No more than two signs may be approved for any one building.
(Ord. 13-05.  Passed 6-7-05.)
1175.06  DEMOLITION OR REMOVAL OF A STRUCTURE.
   (a)   Demolition or Removal Procedure.  The Zoning Inspector shall notify
the Commission of any application involving the demolition, partial demolition
or removal of a structure or a significant accessory structure.  The Commission
shall schedule a public hearing at a date within thirty days of filing of
application with the Zoning Inspector, with proper notification through the
newspaper at least ten days prior to the hearing, and shall notify the
applicant in writing.  At the hearing, the Commission shall be able to request
any or all of the following information:
      (1)   A report from the Commission architect, on the state of repair and
structural stability of the structure under consideration.
      (2)   Information and graphics on the extent and process of demolition or
removal, including information on any proposed changes in landscaping.
      (3)   Evidence of any hardship that would result in substantial economic
loss to the applicant from denial of the petition.
      (4)   An assessment of any alterations in the essential character of the
area which would occur as a result of the demolition or removal action.
   (b)   Decision of the Commission.  If the Commission decision is to postpone
the demolition or removal, the Commission shall notify the owner in writing. 
During the period set forth for postponement of the requested action, the
Commission shall explore alternatives to demolition or removal.  The period set
for postponement of the requested action shall not be greater than six months
from the time of filing the request with the Zoning Inspector except by
agreement of the owner/applicant.  Such alternatives may include consultation
with private civic groups, interested private citizens and other public boards
or agencies in an effort to find a persuasive means of preserving the
structure.  If sale of the property is considered a feasible alternative by the
owner, an appraisal shall be obtained by the Commission to establish a fair
selling price.  If the appraisal obtained by the Commission is unsatisfactory
to the owner/applicant, he may obtain his own appraisal.  The building must
remain on the open market not less than six months.
      (1)   If after the expiration of the listing, no alternative agreement
has been reached with the applicant, the Commission shall issue a certificate
of appropriateness for demolition or removal of the structure in question.
      (2)   In granting the certificate of appropriateness, the Commission
shall prescribe any conditions it deems necessary to minimize the adverse
impact of the requested demolition or removal.
(Ord. 20-1978.  Passed 9-19-78.)
1175.07  PRE-APPLICATION CONFERENCE.
   Prior to the preparation of extensive drawings and specifications, the
individual proposing a change within the district shall present within ten days
prior to a regular meeting a set of rough sketches to the chairman for
consideration and advice from the Commission.  In case of minor repair or
alterations to existing buildings, the Commission may give preliminary and
final approval at one review session.
(Ord. 20-1978.  Passed 9-19-78.)
1175.08  REVIEW PROCEDURE.
   (a)   A zoning certificate shall be required for the construction, erection,
alteration, removal, moving or demolition (hereafter referred to as change) of
any structure or building in the Historic District or one designated as an
Historic Landmark.  The certificate shall not be issued where such action will
affect the exterior architectural features of any such structure or building,
unless and until a certificate of appropriateness has been issued by the
Historic Preservation Commission.  Upon application for a zoning certificate
with respect to any structure or building in the above categories, the Zoning
Inspector shall submit such application, together with all the requirements of
Section
1175.09 within five days of receipt thereof to the Historic Preservation
Commission for its consideration.
   (b)   Upon receipt by the Commission of the zoning permit application and
related materials for any such proposed change, the Commission shall provide
notice to the applicant and meet to consider the application within fourteen
working days of receipt of the materials.  If the application is approved, the
Commission shall issue to the applicant within five days a certificate of
appropriateness.  The certificate expires twelve months from the date of
issuance.
   (c)   If not approved, the Commission shall issue to the applicant a
statement of specific reasons for denial of the certificate together with
suggested revisions in the plan which would lead to approval.  The applicant
may resubmit application at any time.
   (d)   Denial by the Commission of a certificate of appropriateness may be
appealed by the applicant to the Planning Commission in accordance with
Chapter 1147.  After such request from the applicant, the Planning Commission
shall notify the applicant by certified mail of the date of the hearing.  In
addition the date and location of the meeting shall be published at least once
in a paper of local circulation not less than fifteen days prior to the date of
the hearing.  A majority vote of the Planning Commission shall be necessary to
grant a certificate.
(Ord. 20-1978.  Passed 9-19-78.)
1175.09  SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS.
   (a)   Every zoning certificate application for a structure to be built or
remodeled within the Historic District in the City shall be approved by the
Zoning Inspector and the Historic Preservation Commission.  In order for the
above mentioned application to be so approved, the applicant shall submit to
the Zoning Inspector two sets of complete drawings and supplemental
specifications, prepared in accordance with good architectural practice,

1180.01  FINDINGS/PURPOSE AND SCOPE.
   (a)   The City Engineer finds that land development projects and associated
increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds
resulting in the following:
      (1)   The increased risk of flooding. Streams and storm water facilities
that receive excessive sediment have a reduced capacity to convey water, The
increase of storm water runoff rates and volumes can cause flooding, stream
channel erosion and sediment transport and deposition;
      (2)   Damage to fisheries and habitat quality in streams and wetlands
when siltation clogs spawning gravel and when excessive turbidity impairs the
survivability of aquatic organisms;
      (3)   The increase in public expenditures for maintenance of storm water
facilities, ditches, culverts and storm sewers that receive excessive amounts
of sediment;
      (4)   Damage to adjacent properties, including public right-of-ways, when
sediment is deposited on these properties;
      (5)   Promotes transport of nutrients to lakes causing algal blooms and
oxygen depletion.
   (b)   These rules shall apply to all soil-disturbing activities on land
within the City corporate limits used or being developed for non-farm
commercial, industrial residential, or other non-farm purposes, including, but
not limited to: individual or multiple lots, subdivisions, multi-family
developments, condominium units, commercial and industrial developments,
recreational projects, general clearing and grading projects, underground
utilities, highways, building activities on farms, aquaculture ponds,
redevelopment of urban areas and all other uses unless expressly excluded as
follows:
      (1)   Activities related to producing agricultural crops and silviculture
operations or areas regulated by the Ohio Agricultural Sediment Abatement Rules
(H.B. 88).
      (2)   Strip mining and surface mining operations regulated under Ohio
R.C. 1513.01 and 1514.01.
      (3)   Normal landscape maintenance activities and gardening/horticulture.
      (4)   A Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan is not required before
clearing, grading, excavating, filling or otherwise wholly or partially less
than one contiguous acre of land owned by one person or operated as one
development unit; however, areas of less than one contiguous acre are not
exempt from compliance with all other provisions of these rules.
(Ord. 37-09.  Passed 12-15-09.)
1180.02  ADMINISTRATION.
   The Stark Soil and Water Conservation District, acting as the City's duly

devices by the developer's delegated representative, regular inspections will
be performed by the Stark SWCD for compliance with these rules. If it appears
that a violation of any of these rules has occurred, the owner and developer
will be notified of deficiencies or noncompliance in writing through a notice
of violation by proof of delivery mail. If within 30 days after receipt of the
letter, the owner or developer has not rectified the deficiency or received
approval of plans for its correction, a second notice of violation will be
issued. The owner or developer has another 15 days to rectify the violation or
a "stop work order" will be issued immediately by the City engineer.
   (c)   If the City or the Stark Soil and Water Conservation District, acting
as the City's duly authorized representative, determines that a violation
exists, they may request the City Solicitor in writing and shall seek an
injunction to cease work immediately until compliance with these rules. A court
may also order the construction of sediment control improvements or
implementation or other control measures and may assess a civil fine of not
less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more than five hundred dollars
($500.00) for each day of a rule or stop work order.
   (d)   The Stark SWCD may require revisions to the SWPPP as necessary to

special conditions applicable to the site such that strict adherence to the
provisions of these rules will result in unnecessary hardship and not fulfill
the intent of these rules. A written request for variance shall be provided to
the Stark SWCD and shall state the specific variances sought and the reasons
with supporting data for their granting. The Stark SWCD shall not grant a
variance unless and until the applicant provides sufficient specific reasons
justifying the variance. The Stark SWCD will conduct its review of the request
for variance within 20 working days.
   (b)   Adverse economic conditions shall not be a valid reason to grant a
variance.
(Ord. 37-09.  Passed 12-15-09.)

APPENDIX
The following recommendations, materials, and forms are prepared as models for
use by officials in the day-to-day administration of zoning.    These materials
provide basic guidelines for handling almost all areas of zoning, including the
application for and issuance of zoning certificates, procedures and forms for
conditional zoning certificates, amendments to either zoning texts or maps, and
zoning appeals and variances.    Since zoning is one of the major legal tools
to guide and control development, it is important that it be effectively and
appropriately utilized.    These model materials are also a basis for
establishing a greater degree of standardization and continuity in zoning
procedures and administration among neighboring political subdivisions.

1188.01  PURPOSE AND FINDINGS.
   (a)   Purpose.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish reasonable and
uniform regulations to minimize and control the negative effects of amusement
arcades within the City in order to promote the health, safety and welfare of
the citizens of the City. It is not the purpose or intent of this chapter to
restrict or deny access to recreational and skilled-based amusement machines.
   (b)   Findings.
      (1)   The State of Ohio currently allows certain games of skill while
games of chance are deemed illegal. Based upon experience within the City,
certain arcades identified as operating games of skill, have generated various
complaints by citizens, involving thefts, questionable pay practices,
considerable sums of cash being transacted, food management concerns, fire code
and access, and other issues of compliance with local and State laws.
      (2)   These businesses are located throughout the City in general
business districts, in areas which attract adults and children. It is the
specific finding that games of skill operated electronically, may easily be
altered to illegal games of chance. Further, that the City has a duty to its
citizens to require businesses open to the public to maintain safe ingress and
egress, to maintain adequate security where a considerable volume of cash is
transacted, and to otherwise operate within the bounds of the law.
(Ord. 2-10.  Passed 4-6-10.)

1301.02  PURPOSE.
   The purpose of the Ohio Building Code is to establish uniform minimum
requirements for the erection, construction, repair, alteration, and
maintenance of buildings, including construction of industrialized units.  Such
requirements shall relate to the conservation of energy, safety, and sanitation
of buildings for their intended use and occupancy with consideration for the
following:
   (a)   Performance.  Establish such requirements, in terms of performance
objectives for the use intended.
   (b)   Extent of Use.  Permit to the fullest extent feasible, the use of
materials and technical methods, devices, and improvements which tend to reduce
the cost of construction without affecting minimum requirements for the health,
safety, and security of the occupants of buildings without preferential
treatment of types or classes of materials or products or methods of
construction.
   (c)   Standardization.  To encourage, so far as may be practicable, the
standardization of construction practices, methods, equipment, material and
techniques, including methods employed to produce industrialized units.
      The rules of the Board of Building Standards and proceedings shall be
liberally construed in order to promote its purpose.  When the Building
Official finds that the proposed design is a reasonable interpretation of the
provisions of this Code, it shall be approved.  Materials, equipment and
devices approved by the Building Official pursuant to Section 118 of the Ohio
Building Code shall be constructed and installed in accordance with such
approval.
(OBC 101.3)

structure or any appurtenances connected or attached to such buildings or
structures.  As provided in Section 3791.04(B) of the Ohio Revised Code, no
plans or specifications shall be approved or inspection approval given unless
the building represented by those plans or specifications would, if
constructed, repaired, erected or equipped according to those plans or
specifications, comply with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code and

gross income received from sales of products in the building or structure by
the owner or operator is from sales of products produced or raised in a normal
crop year on farms owned or operated by the seller.  (See Sections 3781.06 and

evidence and examine witnesses appearing for or against him.
   (b)   Notice of Violation.  The Building Official is authorized to serve a
notice of violation or order on the person responsible for the erection,
construction, alteration, extension, repair, moving, removal, demolition or
occupancy of a building or structure.  When the Building Official finds that
work or equipment is contrary to approved construction documents and the rules
of the Board of Building Standards, the Building Official shall send a notice
in writing to the owner of said building or the owner's agent which shall state
where and in what respect the work or equipment does not conform to the
approved plans for same and the rules of the Board.  The notice shall specify a
reasonable period of time in which to conform to said plans or the rules of the
Board.  Before any work may continue on the construction, erection, alteration,
or equipment of any building for which the approval is invalid, the owner of
the building shall resubmit the plans or drawings and specifications for
approval as required under Section 105.3 of the Ohio Building Code.
   (c)   Prosecution of Violation.  Upon the issuance of any order provided for

provisions of Section 3781.19 of the Ohio Revised Code and all appeals from
such hearing have been completed, or the order has been released.
(OBC 113)
1301.07  STOP WORK ORDER.
   (a)   Authority.  Whenever the Building Official finds any work regulated by
this Code being performed in a manner contrary to the provisions of this Code
or in a dangerous or unsafe manner, the Building Official is authorized to
issue a stop work order whenever the Building Official finds, after inspection,
that the site preparations or structure to be constructed, or in the case of an
industrialized unit, the installation of the unit, or that the use of an
appliance, materials, assemblage, or manufactured product does not comply with
the provisions of Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised Code or the rules
adopted pursuant thereto.  The effect of such an order shall be limited to the
matter specified in the order.
   (b)   Issuance.  The stop work order shall be in writing and shall be given
to the owner of the property involved, or to the owner's agent and the person
doing the work.  Upon issuance of a stop work order, the cited work shall

and the conditions under which the cited work will be permitted to resume.
   (c)   Unlawful Continuance.  Any person who shall continue any work after
having been served with a stop work order, except such work as that person is
directed to perform to remove a violation or unsafe condition.  Failure to
cease work after receipt of a stop work order is hereby declared a public
nuisance.
(OBC 114)
1301.08  CONFLICT.
   (a)   General.  Where, in any specific case, different sections of the Ohio
Building Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other
requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.  Where there is a conflict
between a general requirement and a specific requirement, the specific
requirement shall be applicable.
   (b)   Other Laws.  The provisions of the Ohio Building Code shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of state or federal law.  The Municipality,
under Section 3781.01 of the Ohio Revised Code, may make further and additional
regulations, not in conflict with Chapters 3781 and 3791 of the Ohio Revised
Code or with the rules of the Board of Building Standards.  However, under
Section 3781.12 of the Ohio Revised Code, approval by the Board of Building
Standards of any fixture, device, material, system, assembly or product of a
manufacturing process, or method or manner of construction or installation
shall constitute approval for their use anywhere in Ohio.  The rules of the
Board of Building Standards shall supersede and govern any order, standard, or
rule of the Division of the Fire Marshal or Industrial Compliance in the
Department of Commerce, and Department of Health and of counties and townships,
in all cases where such orders, standards or rules are in conflict with the
rules of the Board of Building Standards, except that rules adopted and orders

arising from injury, death or loss to persons or property emanating from the

not issue a permit until the exhibitor provides the bond or proof of the
insurance coverage required by this subsection.

1521.01  COST RECOVERY FOR REPAIR OR REMOVAL.
   (a)   No insurance company doing business in the State of Ohio shall pay a
claim of named insured for fire damage to a structure located within the
Village of Canal Fulton where the amount recoverable for the fire loss to the
structure under all insurance policies exceeds five thousand dollars ($5,000)
and is greater than or equal to sixty percent (60%) of all fire insurance
policy monetary limitations unless there is compliance with the following
procedures:
      (1)   When the loss agreed to between the named insured or insureds and
the insurance company or insurance companies equals or exceeds sixty percent
(60%) of the aggregate limits of liability on all fire policies covering the
building or structure, the insurance company or companies, in accordance with
Ohio R.C. 715.26(F), shall transfer from the insurance proceeds to the Clerk-
Treasurer in the aggregate amount of two thousand dollars ($2,000) for each
fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000), and each fraction of that amount, of a
claim, or, if at the time of a proof of loss agreed to between the named
insured or insureds and the insurance company or companies the named insured or
insureds have submitted a contractor's signed estimate of the costs of
removing, repairing, or securing the building or other structure, shall
transfer from the insurance proceeds the amount specified in the estimate. 
There shall be a minimum transfer of two thousand dollars ($2,000).
         A.   Such transfer of proceeds shall be on a pro rata basis by all
companies insuring the building or structure.  Policy proceeds remaining after
the transfer to the Village may be disbursed in accordance with the policy
terms.
         B.   The named insured or insureds may submit a contractor's signed
estimate of the costs of removing, repairing or securing the building or other
structure after the transfer, and the Village Administrator, after notifying
the Fire Chief, shall return the amount of the fund in excess of the estimate
to the named insured or insureds, provided that the Village has not commenced
to remove, repair or secure the building or other structure.
      (2)   Upon receipt of proceeds by the Village as authorized by this
section, the Clerk-Treasurer shall place the proceeds in a separate fund to be
used solely as security against the total cost of removing, repairing or
securing incurred by the Village pursuant to Ohio R.C. 715.261.
         A.   When transferring the fund as required in subsection (a)(1)
hereof, an insurance company shall provide the Village with the name and
address of the named insured or insureds whereupon the Village shall contact
the named insured or insureds, certify that the proceeds have been received by
the Village and notify them that the following procedures will be followed:
         B.   The fund shall be returned by the Village Administrator to the
named insured or insureds when repairs, removal or securing of the building or
other structure have been completed and the required proof is received by the
Fire Chief, provided that, the Village has not incurred any costs for such
repairs, removal or securing.  If the Village has incurred any costs for
repairs, removal or securing of the building or other structure, such costs
shall be paid from the fund and if excess funds remain, the Village shall
transfer the remaining funds to the named insured or insureds after repair,
rebuilding or removal has been completed.  Nothing in this section shall be

be construed to prohibit the Village and the named insured or insureds from
entering into an agreement that permits the transfer of funds to the named
insured or insureds if some other reasonable disposition of the damaged
property has been negotiated.
   (b)   The Village Administrator, on behalf of the Village, is hereby
designated as the officer authorized to carry out the duties of this section,
provided that no funds so held under this section shall be released without
notification of such intent to the Fire Chief.

copy of this section to the Superintendent of Insurance for the State of Ohio.
