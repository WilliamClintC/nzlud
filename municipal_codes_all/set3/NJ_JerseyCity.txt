PREFACE 
The City of Jersey City has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the city, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity of modern life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the city. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the Council ordered the following codification of the city's legislation, to replace the 1971 Code of the City of Jersey City, adopted 5-4-1971, as readopted 9-19-1978 by Ord. No. S-128 and June 14, 1995 by Ord. No. 95-050. The following paragraphs will further explain the organization and contents of the Code of Jersey City. 
Contents of Code 
The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective legislation of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Council of the City of Jersey City, including revisions or amendments to existing legislation deemed necessary by the Council in the course of the codification. 
Division of Code 
The Code is divided into parts. Part I, Administrative Legislation, contains all city legislation of an administrative nature, namely, that dealing with the administration of government, that establishing or regulating municipal departments and that affecting officers and employees of the municipal government and its departments. Part II, General Legislation, contains all other city legislation of a regulatory nature. Items of legislation in this part generally impose penalties for violation of their provisions, whereas those in Part I do not. 
Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters 
The various items of legislation are organized into chapters, their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter. Thus, for example, all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in Part II, in the chapter entitled ""Streets and Sidewalks." In such chapters, use of Article or Part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation. 
Table of Contents 
The Table of Contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the several Articles or Parts are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate location of the material. 
Reserved Chapters 
Space has been provided in the Code for the convenient insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments. In the Table of Contents such space appears as chapters entitled "(Reserved)." In the body of the Code, reserved space is provided by breaks in the page-numbering sequence between chapters. 
Pagination 
A unique page-numbering system has been used, in which each chapter forms an autonomous unit. One hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter, and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals "01." Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 601, Chapter 53 on page 5301, etc. By use of this system, it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters, and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization. 
Numbering of Sections 
A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed, in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is § 6-1, while the fourth section of Chapter 53 is § 53-4. New sections can then be added between existing sections using a decimal system. Thus, for example, if two sections were to be added between §§ 53-4 and 53-5, they would be numbered as §§ 53-4.1 and 53-4.2. 
Scheme 
The Scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease and precision of reference, the Scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text. 
Histories 
At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived, including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number, local law number, bylaw number, resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing Parts or Articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of each Part or Article is indicated in the History. Amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.

"Excessive costs" are hereby defined as costs of purchasing green products where either the immediate cost of purchasing the green product exceeds by seventy-five percent (75%) the immediate cost of the comparable conventional product in the current fiscal year, or where the average yearly cost of the green product exceeds by seventy-five percent (75%) the average yearly cost of comparable conventional product when amortized over the entire lifetime of both products. When evaluating the costs of green products and comparable conventional products, the Purchasing Agent shall compare total costs of each including, but not limited to: the costs of maintenance, insurance, disposal, replacement, safety and health, training, material management and potential liability costs. 
"Green products" are hereby defined as those products which the Purchasing Agent has determined would have a lesser or reduced negative effect on human health and the environment when compared with comparable conventional products and services, where such comparison includes consideration of all phases of the product's life cycle, including raw materials acquisition, production, manufacturing, packaging, transportation, distribution, operation, maintenance, and disposal, including potential for reuse or ability to be recycled. 
"Green purchasing" is hereby defined as the practice of purchasing green products. 
"Green Seal" is the non-profit organization, located at 1001 Connecticut Avenue, NW, Suite 827, Washington, DC 20036-5525 which evaluates and certifies products based on each product's environmental impact throughout its life cycle.

The Purchasing Agent may, in consultation with the City department(s) ordering or leasing the product(s), evaluate for environmental impact such other products as he or she deems appropriate and may classify as green products those products which, considering the totality of their life cycle, have a reduced effect on human health and the environment when compared with comparable products that serve a similar function. 
(e)  Guidance for Green Product Classification. The Purchasing Agent, when evaluating and classifying products as "green products," shall consult: 
[1]  the Comprehensive Procurement Guideline for Products Containing Recovered Materials, as set forth in part 247 of Title 40 of the United States Code of Federal Regulations;

GreenSeal Certified Products and products which have achieved equivalent third-party certification shall be classified as green products unless they contain dangerous levels of toxic or hazardous substances, as defined in section (i), or unless there is a compelling reason not to so classify them. Compelling reasons against classification of such products as green products may include, but are not limited to: 
[1]  excessive distance a product must be shipped throughout its life-cycle 
[2]  environmentally harmful packaging 
[3]  product's lack of fuel efficiency or energy efficiency 
[4]  product's emission of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs); and 
[5]  product's significant lack of durability. 
(g)  Requirement for purchasing green products. Subject to paragraph (h) below, the Purchasing Agent shall purchase green products over comparable conventional products whenever the cost of the green product does not exceed by twenty-five percent (75%) the cost of comparable conventional product, and may purchase green products over comparable conventional products when the cost of green product does not exceed by seventy-five percent (75%) the cost of the comparable conventional product. When evaluating the cost of a green product and a comparable product, the Purchasing Agent shall compare total costs over the life of the item, including, but not limited to: the costs of maintenance, insurance, disposal, replacement, safety and health, training, material management and potential liability costs. 
(h)  Waiver of green product preference. Wherever there exists one (1) or more significant concerns regarding the purchase or lease of a green product, including excessive costs, health, safety, performance, compatibility, lack of availability within a reasonable period of time, or statutory prohibitions the Purchasing Agent may waive the preference for purchasing a green product and may purchase, lease, or allow the purchase or lease of comparable conventional products to the extent such concerns require, subject to section (i)[3]. Reasons for such a waiver shall be detailed in writing by the Purchasing Agent and maintained in the Office of the Purchasing Agent. 
(i)  Toxic or hazardous substances. The presence of toxic or hazardous substances is to be considered in product classification and purchasing as follows: 
[1]  The Purchasing Agent shall not classify as green products any products which he or she determines contain dangerous levels of toxic or hazardous substances including, but not limited to lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium, polybrominated biphenyls or polybrominated dephenyl ethers. 
[2]  The Purchasing Agent shall consider a product's achievement of Green Seal Certification or equivalent third-party certification as compelling evidence that the level of toxic or hazardous substances in the product is not dangerous. 
[3]  The Purchasing Agent shall not select products with dangerous levels of toxic or hazardous substances for purchase or lease except where: 
[a]  Purchasing Agent has waived the green product requirement pursuant to material concerns specified in subsection (h) above; and 
[b]  There is no comparable conventional product available that addresses the material concerns necessitating the waiver but does not contain dangerous levels of toxic or hazardous substances. 
(j)  Maintenance of information about green products. The Purchasing Agent shall develop and maintain lists, descriptions and other relevant documentary information about green products and recycled products and make such information available to all City departments whenever possible. 
(k)  Purchasing or lease contract specifications. The Purchasing Agent shall review and modify current and future procurement requirements so that contract specifications, clauses and solicitation language address the standards of subsection F(3). 
(l)  Electronic devices. In accordance with subsections [1][5] below, the Purchasing Agent shall evaluate all electronic devices purchased or leased by the City for environmental impact, and determine whether all such electronic devices shall be to classified as green products. 
[1]  Except as indicated in paragraph (i) above, electronic devices issued the ENERGY STAR title shall be considered green products for the purposes of this ordinance. 
[2]  The Purchasing Agent may also classify electronic devices which are not ENERGY STAR products as green products. In determining such classification, the Purchasing Agent shall consult those guidelines and standards issued, or to be issued, by the New Jersey State agency which is, or will be, charged with establishing energy-efficient guidelines, in addition to the guidelines denoted in paragraph (e) and (f) above. 
[3]  Subject to sections [4] and [5] below, when purchasing or leasing new electronic devices or replacing existing electronic devices the City shall select those which are both ENERGY STAR products and green products, where available, over those which are green products but not ENERGY STAR Products. 
[4]  In accordance with section (i) above, wherever an ENERGY STAR electronic device contains dangerous levels of toxic or hazardous substances, it shall not be considered a green product and shall not be selected over other electronic devices which are green products. 
[5]  Whenever valid concerns regarding the purchase or lease of a ENERGY STAR Electronic Device exist, including health, safety, performance, availability, statutory prohibitions and/or excessive costs, the Purchasing Agent may waive the requirement for purchasing the ENERGY STAR electronic device, and may purchase, lease, or allow the purchase or lease of comparable non-ENERGY STAR products to the extent such concerns require. Reasons for such a waiver shall be detailed in writing by the Purchasing Agent and maintained in the contract file. 
(m)  Carpets. In accordance with [1] and [2] below, the Purchasing Agent or his or her designee shall evaluate all carpets, carpet cushions, and carpet adhesives purchased or leased by the City for environmental impact, and determine whether all such products shall be classified as green products: 
[1]  The Purchasing Agent may consider any widely accepted industry recommendations for reduced volatile organic compounds when classifying carpeting products in addition to the guidelines denoted in paragraphs (e) and (f) above. 
[2]  No carpet, carpet cushion, or carpet adhesive purchased by any City department shall contain the following volatile organic compounds in any significant concentration:

The Purchasing Agent shall have the authority to change classification status of any product by either adding or removing such product from the list of green products provided he or she has good cause to reclassify and does so according to the principles set forth in subsections (e), (f) and (i). Good cause to reclassify shall include but not be limited to: 
[1]  Changes in the physical makeup or manufacture of the product or packaging which result in a material change in the product's net impact on human health, safety, or the environment. 
[2]  Changes in the distribution or transportation of the product which result in a material change in the product's net impact on human health, safety, or the environment. 
[3]  Purchasing Agent's discovery of information previously unknown to him or her regarding the presence or absence of dangerous levels of toxic or hazardous substances in the product, the threat any such substances impose, or newly discovered hazards of substances previously not considered hazardous.

(p)  The City of Jersey City will not purchase products containing in whole or in part wood from tropical forests or temperate rainforests excepting those woods which are proven to have been harvested in an environmentally sound manner in accordance with the guidelines set forth in Appendix A. [Added 3-22-2006 by Ord. No. 06-035] 
The city will not allow the use or purchase of products containing in whole or in part wood from tropical forests or temperate rainforests by any entity either using monies provided by the City of Jersey City for fulfillment of contracts or purchasing agreements, or on leased properties belonging to the City. 
APPENDIX A 
Terms of this resolution will be met if it can be proven through an independent certification program approved by the Forest Stewardship Council that the tropical forest or temperate rainforest wood product has come from a forest operation that meets the following conditions*: 
Local Involvement 
Local communities are involved in all stages of planning and management of a diverse array of forest products for sustainable yields, including non-timber forest products. 
Land Rights 
Projects must not interfere with aboriginal or traditional land rights of indigenous peoples, or other current land tenants. 
Ecology 
Timber harvesting cannot adversely affect beneficial physical processes such as climatic regulations, the surface or ground water quality or the overall watershed function. 
Timber harvesting must maintain soil productivity and not increase erosion rates. 
Timber harvesting must not use synthetic or other harmful pesticides or herbicides. 
Timber harvesting must not diminish biological diversity of flora and fauna including tree species. 
The potential for continuous harvest of all timber and non-timber forest products must be maintained. 
* At this time there are certain independent programs that certify timber production in the tropics and in temperate regions as meeting these and other conditions. These include but are not limited to the Smart Wood Program of the Rainforest Alliance, and Scientific Certification Systems. Wood products labeled as Smart Wood or SCS Certified would meet the above conditions and would be considered acceptable as meeting the conditions of this ordinance. 
 Forest Stewardship Council (FSC)-accredited certifications in old growth tropical rainforests are not currently meeting this criterion and are therefore excluded from this exemption. 
The Forest Stewardship Council is an international body accepted as an overseer of independent certifiers. The Forest Stewardship Council guidelines have met with approval by organizations around the world.

(b)  For the purpose of this section, "not-for-profit organization" means an entity that is either incorporated as a not-for-profit corporation under the laws of the state of its incorporation or exempt from federal income tax pursuant to subdivision (c)(3) of section five hundred of the United States internal revenue code. 
(c)  For the purposes of this section, "City" shall include but not be limited to the Mayor, the Business Administrator, any City agency, not-for-profit organization, public benefit corporation, or other entity that provides or administers economic development benefits on behalf of the City. 
(d)  For the purposes of this section, "covered development project" means a project undertaken by the city for the purpose of improvement or development of real property, economic development job retention or growth, or other similar purposes where the project has received or is expected to receive financial assistance. 
(e)  For the purposes of this section, "economic development financial assistance" means assistance with an anticipated total value of at least one million dollars that is provided in whole or in part by the city to a business organization for the improvement or development of real property, economic development job retention and growth, or other similar purposes. Financial assistance includes, but is not limited to, cash payments or grants, bond financing, tax exemptions, tax increment financing, filing fee waivers, energy cost reductions, environmental remediation costs, write-downs in the market value of building, land, or leases, or the cost of capital improvements related to real property that under ordinary circumstances, the city would not pay for. Where assistance takes the form of leasing city property at below-market lease rates, the value of the assistance shall be determined based on the total difference between the lease rate and a fair market lease rate over the duration of the lease. Where assistance takes the form of loans or bond financing, the value of the assistance shall be determined based on the difference between the financing cost to a borrower and the cost to a similar borrower that does not receive financial assistance from a city economic development entity. For the purposes of this section, "economic development financial assistance" does not include Community Development Block Grants or Community Services Block Grants funded by the federal government, Urban Enterprise funding or Choice/HOME Program funds. 
(f)  For the purposes of this section, "Tax Abated Project" means a project that has a total construction cost that is equal to or exceeds twenty-five million dollars ($25,000,000.00) exclusive of any land acquisition costs, for which the City has granted a tax abatement pursuant to the Long Term Tax Exemption Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:20-1 et seq., or the Five-Year Exemption and Abatement Law, N.J.S.A. 40A:21-1 et seq. However, any project that is being undertaken by a not-for-profit organization or which shall contain more than fifty percent (50%) affordable housing, shall also be excluded. 
(g)  For the purposes of this section, the "standard hourly rate of pay" shall be 150% of the federal minimum wage, or the hourly rate of pay for work performed within the city under the collective bargaining agreement covering the largest number of hourly non-supervisory employees employed within Hudson County in the relevant classification, provided the collective bargaining agreement covers no less than two hundred (200) employees in the classification, whichever is higher. 
(h)  For the purposes of this section, "standard benefits" shall be an hourly supplement furnished by a contractor to an employee in one of the following ways: 1) in the from of health benefits that cost the employer the entire required hourly supplemental amount to provide; 2) by providing a portion of the supplement in the form of health benefits and the balance in cash; or 3) by providing the entire supplement in cash. The required hourly supplemental rate shall be equal to the monetary value of the benefits provided by the collective bargaining agreement covering the largest number of hourly non-supervisory employees employed within Hudson County in the relevant classification, provided the collective bargaining agreement covers no less than two hundred (200) employees in the classification. If there is no such collective bargaining agreement, "standard benefits" shall be an additional 20% of the employee's hourly rate of pay provided as a supplement to cover health benefits. For the purposes of this section, "health benefits" shall not include workers compensation insurance, nor shall it include the value of any benefit for which an employee is eligible but for which no payment is actually made by a contractor to the employee or to any other party on the employee's behalf because the employee either does not actually utilize or does not elect to receive the benefit for any reason. 
(2)  Every covered developer shall be required to ensure that all janitors and unarmed security guards employed at Covered Development Projects and Tax Abated Projects, including any and all tenants or subtenants of the covered developer, shall be paid not less than the standard hourly rate of pay and benefits for their respective classifications and shall be provided with paid leave in accordance with the provisions of the Jersey City Municipal Code Section 3-51 G(1). Every contract signed by the City for Covered Development Projects and Tax Abated Projects with a business organization shall contain a provision stating the standard hourly rate of pay, the standard benefits and paid leave for janitors and unarmed security guards employed at the premises for which the economic development financial assistance is provided. Such contracts shall contain a stipulation that those workers shall be and/or have been paid not less than the standard hourly rate of pay, shall receive no less than the standard benefits and shall be provided with paid leave in accordance with the provisions of Jersey City Municipal Code Section 3-51 G(1). The obligation of a contractor to pay the standard benefits may be discharged by furnishing the standard benefits 1) in the form of health benefits that cost the employer at least $3.10 an hour to provide; 2) by providing a portion of the standard benefit in the form of health benefits and the balance in cash; or 3) by providing $3.10 an hour in cash over and above the standard hourly rate. This provision shall be included in any lease of the covered developer or its tenants and subtenants to insure that the provisions of this ordinance shall apply regardless of whether the janitors or unarmed security guards are directly or indirectly employed by the business organization receiving the economic development financial assistance. The contract shall provide for annual adjustments of the standard rate of pay and benefits during the term of the contract. 
(3)  For the purposes of this section, the annual adjustments of the hourly rate of pay and benefits shall be made in the following way. The annually adjusted hourly rate of pay shall be the previous hourly rate of pay increased by the annual percentage difference between the current New York Metropolitan Area Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all items for All Urban Consumers and the same CPI for same month of the previous year, or the hourly rate of pay for work performed within the city under the collective bargaining agreement covering the largest number of hourly non-supervisory employees employed within Hudson County in the relevant classification, provided the collective bargaining agreement covers no less than two hundred (200) employees in the classification, whichever is higher. The benefit rate shall be annually adjusted accordingly. 
(4)  Reporting. All contracts signed by the City for Covered Development Projects or Tax Abated Projects shall require the submission to the business administrator of an annual certification by the covered developer executed under penalty of perjury that all janitors and unarmed security guards employed at a city development project or a tax abated project by the covered developer or under contract or lease or sublease with the covered developer to perform janitorial or security services will be and/or have been paid the standard wage and provided with standard benefits and standard leave for the relevant classifications. Such certification shall include a record of the days and hours worked and the wages and benefits paid to each janitor or unarmed security guards employed at the city development project or under contract with the covered developer. Such certification shall be certified by the chief executive or chief financial officer of the covered developer, or the designee of any such person. A violation of any provision of the certification, or failure to provide such certification, shall constitute a violation of this section. 
(5)  Record keeping. Each covered developer shall maintain original payroll records for each janitor and unarmed security reflecting the days and hours worked, and the wages paid and benefits provided for such hours worked, and shall retain such records for at least six years after the janitorial or security work is performed. The covered developer may satisfy this requirement by obtaining copies of records from the employer or employers of such employees. Failure to maintain such records as required shall create a rebuttable presumption that the janitors or unarmed security guards were not paid the wages and benefits required under this section. Upon written request of the city, the covered developer shall provide a certified original payroll record within ten (10) days of the date of the request. 
(6)  Site access. Representatives of the city shall be permitted to have appropriate access to all covered development projects in order to monitor compliance. 
(7)  The requirements of this section shall apply for the term of the economic development financial assistance or tax abatement for ten years from the date that the financially assisted project is substantially complete which ordinarily means the date of the issuance of the first certificate of occupancy for the project or for the duration of any written agreement between the city and a covered developer providing for financial assistance, whichever is longer. 
(8)  Right of action for janitors and unarmed security guards. Violation of this provisions shall constitute a breach of the standard wage and benefit and paid leave provisions of the contract by the business organization receiving the economic development subsidy and such provisions shall be considered to be a contract for the benefit of the building service workers upon which such workers shall have the right to maintain action for the difference between the standard hourly rate of pay, benefits and paid leave and the rates of pay, benefits and paid leave actually received by them, and including attorney's fees. 
(9)  Penalties. In the event of a failure to comply with the provisions of this section, the covered developer shall be provided with a written notice of failure to comply allowing the covered developer ten (10) days to 'cure' the failure to comply. If the covered developer fails to timely cure, then in addition to any other remedies available at law or in equity including termination of the contract the City shall be permitted to seek the following remedies for the failure to comply with this ordinance: 
(a)  A material breach of any term a) an increase in the amount of the annual service charge of one percent (1%) of the estimated annual payment until the breach is cured; or b) a payment to the City of an amount equal to the greater of two percent (2%) of the annual value of the economic development subsidy or two-tenths of a percent (0.2%) of the total value of the economic development subsidy: 
(b)  A material breach of this section that continues for a period of six (6) months or more, shall allow the City to terminate the tax abatement or economic development subsidy. 
(10)   The Director of Economic Development shall maintain a list of business organizations that have received economic development assistance that shall include, where a written agreement between the city and a business organization providing for financial assistance is targeted to particular real property, the address of each such property. Such list shall be updated and published as often as is necessary to keep it current. The Director of Economic Development's failure to include a business organization on the list shall not excuse the business organization from its obligations under this section.

§ 4-3. - Application. 
[Added 9-25-2013 by Ord. No. 13-097 ; amended 10-28-2015 by Ord. No. 15-145 ] 
This chapter requires all those employed within the City of Jersey City to accrue either paid or unpaid sick time from their employer as mandated by this chapter utilizing the formula applied herein. 
Individuals who work for employers who employ ten (10) or more employees shall accrue compensated sick time up to a maximum of forty (40) hours per year. 
Individuals who work for employers who employ less than ten (10) employees shall accrue compensated sick time up to a maximum of twenty-four (24) hours per year. In addition, once such individuals have accrued twenty-four (24) hours of compensated sick time, they shall accrue unpaid sick time up to a maximum of sixteen (16) hours per year. 
Taking of sick time, whether compensated or not shall not be the basis of an adverse employment action. 
A.  Accrual of Paid Sick Time. 
(1)  Employees shall accrue a minimum of one (1) hour of paid or unpaid sick time for every thirty (30) hours worked subject to the limits set forth below in A(2) and A(3). 
(2)  Employers who employ ten (10) or more employees for compensation are not required to provide more than forty (40) hours of paid sick time in a calendar year. In determining the number of employees performing work for an employer, all employees performing work for compensation on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis shall be counted, provided that where the number of employees who work for an employer for compensation fluctuates, the number of employees may be determined for the current calendar year based upon the average number of employees who worked for compensation during the preceding calendar year. 
Employers who employ less than ten (10) employees for compensation are not required to provide more than twenty-four (24) hours of paid sick time in a calendar year except for employees who are child care workers, home health care workers and food service workers. For child care workers, health care workers and food service workers, employers are required to provide up to forty (40) hours of paid sick time, so long as the hours are accrued in a calendar year as set forth elsewhere in this Section. 
In determining the number of employees performing work for an employer, all employees performing work for compensation, whether on a full-time, part-time, or temporary basis shall be counted, provided that where the number of employees who work for an employer for compensation fluctuates, the number of employees may be determined for the current calendar year based upon the average number of employees who worked for compensation during the preceding calendar year. 
(3)  Employees who are exempt from overtime requirements under 29 U.S.C. § 201 et seq. of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act are assumed to work forty (40) hours in each work week for purposes of paid sick time accrual unless their normal work week is less than forty (40) hours, in which case paid sick time accrues based upon that normal work week. 
(4)  Paid sick time as provided in this section begins to accrue at the commencement of employment. 
(5)  Employees begin to accrue paid sick time on the first day of employment. Employees are entitled to use accrued paid sick time beginning on the ninetieth calendar day of their employment. After the ninetieth calendar day of employment, employees may use paid sick time as it is accrued. 
(6)  Paid sick time is carried over to the following calendar year except that no employer is required to carry over more than forty (40) hours of paid sick time from one (1) calendar year to the next and nothing in this section entitles an employee to use more than forty (40) hours of paid sick time in a calendar year. 
(7)  Any employer with a paid leave policy, such as a paid time off policy, that provides an amount of paid leave sufficient to meet the total annual accrual requirements of this section that may be used for the same purposes and under the same conditions as paid sick time under this chapter is not required to provide additional paid sick time. 
(8)  Nothing in this section shall be construed as requiring financial or other reimbursement to an employee from an employer upon the employee's termination, resignation, retirement, or other separation from employment for accrued paid sick time that has not been used. 
(9)  If an employee is transferred to a separate division, entity, or location, but remains employed by the same employer, the employee is entitled to all paid sick time accrued at the prior division, entity, or location and is entitled to use all paid sick time as provided in this section. If there is a separation from employment and the employee is rehired within six (6) months of separation, previously accrued paid sick time that had not been used shall be reinstated. Further, the employee is entitled to use accrued paid sick time and accrue additional paid sick time at the re-commencement of employment. 
(10)   When a different employer succeeds or takes the place of an existing employer, all employees of the original employer who remain employed by the successor employer are entitled to all paid sick time accrued when employed by the original employer and are entitled to use all paid sick leave previously accrued. 
(11)   At its discretion, an employer may loan sick time to an employee in advance of accrual by such employee. 
(12)   The requirements of this Chapter shall not apply to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) to the extent that such requirements are expressly waived in the collective bargaining agreement in clear and unambiguous terms. With respect to employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the effective date of this Chapter, no provision of this Chapter shall apply until the expiration of the collective bargaining agreement; however, if the terms of an expired collective bargaining agreement provide paid sick leave that is more generous than provided by this Chapter, those terms of the expired collective bargaining agreement shall govern. 
B.  Use of Sick Time. 
(1)  Sick time shall be provided to an employee by an employer for: 
a.  An employee's mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; an employee's need for medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; an employee's need for preventive medical care; 
b.  Care of a family member with a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care of a family member who needs medical diagnosis, care, or treatment of a mental or physical illness, injury, or health condition; care of a family member who needs preventive medical care; and 
c.  Closure of the employee's place of business by order of a public official due to a public health emergency or an employee's need to care for a child whose school or place of care has been closed by order of a public official due to a public health emergency, or care for a family member when it has been determined by the health authorities having jurisdiction or by a health care provider that the family member's presence in the community would jeopardize the health of others because of the family member's exposure to a communicable disease, whether or not the family member has actually contracted the communicable disease. 
(2)  Sick time shall be provided upon the oral request of an employee. 
(3)  An employee shall give an employer notice of the need to use sick time as soon as practicable. 
(4)  An employer may not require, as a condition of an employee's taking sick time, that the employee search for or find a replacement worker to cover the hours during which the employee is absent. 
(5)  Accrued sick time may be used in the smaller of hourly increments or the smallest increment that the employer's payroll system uses to account for absences or use of other time. 
(6)  For sick time of more than three (3) consecutive days, an employer may require reasonable documentation that the paid sick time has been used for a purpose covered by Section 4-2 of this chapter. Reasonable documentation includes: documentation signed by a heath care professional indicating that paid sick time is necessary. An employer may not require that the documentation explain the nature of the illness. 
(7)  Individuals who work for employers who employ less than ten (10) employees and who have accrued both compensated and unpaid sick time shall not be required by his or her employer to exhaust unpaid sick time before using compensated sick time.  
§ 4-4. - Exercise of rights protected; retaliation prohibited.

E.  Protections of this section apply to any person who mistakenly but in good faith alleges violations of this chapter. 
F.  There is a rebuttable presumption of unlawful retaliation under this section whenever an employer takes adverse action against a person within ninety (90) days of when that person: 
(1)  Files a complaint with the Agency or a court alleging a violation of any provision of this chapter; 
(2)  Informs any person about an employer's alleged violation of this chapter; 
(3)  Cooperates with the Agency or other persons in the investigation or prosecution of any alleged violation of this chapter; 
(4)  Opposes any policy, practice, or ordinance that is unlawful under this chapter; or 
(5)  Informs any person of his or her potential rights under this chapter.  
§ 4-5. - Notice and posting. 
[Added 9-25-2013 by Ord. No. 13-097 ] 
A.  All employers shall give individual written notice to each of their employees at the commencement of the employee's employment (or as soon as practicable if the employee is already employed on the effective date of this law) regarding employee's rights under this chapter. Such notice shall describe the right to paid sick time, the accrual rate and the amount of paid sick time, and the terms of its use guaranteed under this chapter; the right to be free from retaliation for requesting use of paid sick time; and the right to file a complaint or bring a civil action if paid sick time is denied by the employer or the employee is retaliated against for requesting or taking paid sick time. Such notice shall be in English and the primary language spoken by that employee provided that the Department has made available a translation of such notice into such language. 
B.  Employers shall also display a poster in a conspicuous and accessible place in each establishment where employees are employed containing notice of this chapter. The poster shall be in English and in any language that is the first language of at least ten percent (10%) of the employer's workforce provided that the Department has made available a translation of such notice into such language. 
C.  The Department shall create and make available to employers individual notices and posters. Notices and posters shall be provided in English, Spanish, Italian, Chinese, Polish, Portuguese, Tagalog, and any other languages selected by the Agency. 
D.  An employer who violates the notice and posting requirements of this section is subject to a civil fine in an amount not to exceed one hundred dollars ($100.00) for each employee who was not given appropriate notice pursuant to this section and five hundred dollars ($500.00) for each establishment in which a poster was not displayed.  
§ 4-6. - Employer records. 
[Added 9-25-2013 by Ord. No. 13-097 ] 
Employers shall retain for three (3) years records documenting hours worked by employees and paid sick time taken by employees and shall allow the Department reasonable access to such records, to monitor compliance with the requirements of this chapter.

D.  The Department shall establish a system for reviewing and adjudicating complaints by employees. Employers deemed by the Department to be in violation of this chapter shall be subject to the penalty prescribed in § 1-25 of the Municipal Code: the maximum penalty for violating this chapter shall be, in the discretion of the Court, a fine of up to two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) and/or a period of community service not exceeding ninety (90) days.

[Amended 10-28-2015 by Ord. No. 15-145 ]

1.  Fail or refuse to pay the agreed payment within 30 days after completion of the agreed services; 
2.  Demand as a condition of timely payment after work has begun that the freelance worker accept less payment than the amount of the agreed compensation; or

It shall be a defense to any violation charged under this section that the freelance worker has not completed the agreed services unless the failure to complete the agreed services was caused by the hiring party's failure to cooperate in good faith with the freelance worker, provided, however, that timely payment for the value of completed services may not be withheld because of a disagreement over any additional payments claimed by the freelance worker. 
B.  The written contract shall include, at a minimum, the following information: 
1.  The name and mailing address of both the hiring party and the freelance worker; 
2.  An itemization of all services to be provided by the freelance worker, the value of the services to be provided pursuant to the contract and the rate and method of compensation; and 
3.  The date on which the hiring party must pay the contracted compensation or the mechanism by which such date will be determined. 
C.  For purpose of this law, a person regularly engages in commercial or business activity if he or she owns or operates any business or trade or commercial property within the city or holds himself or herself out as regularly engaging in any business or trade. The resident owner of residential real property with four or fewer units and no commercial unit is not considered to be engaged in commercial or business activity under this section. 
D.  As used herein "freelance worker" means any natural person or any organization composed of no more than one natural person, whether or not incorporated or employing a trade name, that is hired or retained as an independent contractor by a hiring party to provide services in exchange for compensation. This term does not include: 
1.  Any person who, pursuant to the contract at issue, is a sales representative as defined in N.J.S.A. Title 2A; 
2.  Any licensed attorney; and

It has been the practice of the City of Jersey City to defend lawsuits against employees which arise out of the good faith performance of official duties and to pay any judgment against an employee which he or she incurs in the good faith performance of official duties. The purpose of this chapter is to define clearly the circumstances under which the Corporation Counsel will defend lawsuits against employees and the terms on which the city will indemnify employees against any judgments arising out of official duties. The duty to defend and indemnify employees, as defined in this chapter, supersedes all prior customs and practices regarding the defense and indemnification of employees.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
EMPLOYEE - Any officer or employee of the City of Jersey City, whether elected or appointed, except employees of the Department of Public Safety enTitled to a legal defense under N.J.S.A. 40A:14-28 and 40A:14-155.

If the Corporation Counsel later determines that the employee is not entitled to a legal defense at the city's expense, he or she shall so notify the employee in writing.  
§ 227-5. - Methods of providing defense. 
A.  The Corporation Counsel may at his or her option provide for legal defense of an employee by:

§ 227-6. - Corporation Counsel to assume control of defense. 
Whenever the Corporation Counsel provides for the defense of an employee, he or she may assume exclusive control over the employee's defense, and the employee shall cooperate fully with the Corporation Counsel's defense.

A.  Whenever the Corporation Counsel is required to provide for the defense of any action against an employee, the city shall pay or reimburse the employee for: 
(1)  Any bona fide settlement of the action approved by the Corporation Counsel and the City Council.

§ 105-1. - Findings and purpose. 
[Added 5-9-2018 by Ord. No. 18-036 ] 
A.  The Municipal Council finds that: 
1.  A significant percentage of the City's building stock is older than 50 years of age; 
2.  The architectural surveys of all of the City's Wards conducted by Dr. Joseph Brooks, (known as the Phase One Survey of the City of Jersey City] Mary B. Dierickx, and James W. Foss (known as the Phase Two Survey of the City of Jersey City) as well as the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection - Historic Preservation Office: List of New Jersey and National Registers of Historic Places, reveal that there are many buildings and structures throughout the City that are culturally, historically, and architecturally significant and worthy of preservation; 
3.  The need to redevelop the City often requires demolition of older buildings and structures to make way for new construction, but over the years, countless buildings and structures which possess cultural, historical and/or architectural significance have been lost because they were demolished without holistic review of their cultural, historical or architectural value; 
4.  It is in the City's best interest to balance the need to redevelop the City with the need to ensure that buildings and structures which possess cultural, historical and/or architectural significance are preserved for future generations to enjoy; and 
5.  It is in the City's best interest to mandate that all applications for demolition permits be reviewed by its Historic Preservation Officer prior to issuance of a demolition permit to ensure that that buildings and structures which possess cultural, historical and/or architectural significance are preserved whenever possible. 
B.  The purpose of this Chapter is to: 
1.  Ensure the safety and preservation of buildings and/or structures immediately adjacent to a building or structure proposed for demolition; 
2.  Safeguard the cultural and historical heritage of the City of Jersey City by preserving buildings and structures that reflect elements of its cultural, architectural and/or historical heritage; and

§ 116-6. - Channel policies. [Added 4-28-2010 by Ord. No. 10-052]

For purposes of policy, a person is considered to be a candidate from the time of announcing publicly for any public office until the election has been held. This policy does not apply to persons who receive incidental air time as part of a public meeting being televised, nor to officials acting as part of the regular duties when such actions do not involve partisan policies; 
C.  Neutrality: in any program concerning subjects that may be interpreted to be materially controversial, JC1TV will maintain a position of neutrality, providing unbiased information. Requests for presentation of an opposing viewpoint during a legislative meeting will be directed to the appropriate agency for action on their agenda; 
D.  Non-commercial: JC1TV will not televise any paid advertising or any program that depicts a product, business and/or service that has the purpose of benefitting a profit-making enterprise; 
E.  Non-discriminatory: JC1 TV shall not discriminate in the delivery of its services on the basis of race, color, creed, national origination, sex, sexual orientation or mental or physical ability or any other protected category; 
F.  Non-sectarian Programming: JC1 TV will not televise any program that exposes or promotes any particular religious group or belief.

D.  (Reserved) 
E.  (Reserved) 
F.  (Reserved) 
G.  The minor carries a certified card of employment or is on the way to or from a place of employment. 
H.  The minor is in a motor vehicle with parental consent from normal travel, either intra- or interstate, through the City of Jersey City. 
I.  The minor carries on his or her person a special permit from the Chief of Police authorized as follows: when necessary nighttime activities of a minor may be inadequately provided for by other provisions of this chapter recourse may be had to the Chief of Police, either for a regulation as provided in Subsection J or for a special permit as the circumstances warrant: upon the findings of necessity for the use of the streets to the extent warranted by a written application signed by a minor and by a parent of the minor, if feasible, stating the name, age and address of the minor; the name, address and telephone number of a parent thereof; the height, weight, sex, color of eyes and hair and other physical characteristics of the minor; the necessity which requires the minor to be present on the public streets; and the beginning and ending of the period of time involved by date and hour. The Chief of Police may grant a permit in writing for the use by the minor of streets at such hours as in the opinion of the Chief of Police may reasonably be necessary. In an emergency this may be accomplished by telephone or other effective communication, with a corresponding record being made contemporaneously by the Chief of Police or to the person designated by the Chief of Police to act on his or her behalf in an emergency, at the police station. 
J.  There exists a regulation issued by the Chief of Police in other similar cases of reasonable necessity, similarly handled but adapted to necessary nighttime activities of more minors than can readily be dealt with on an individual special permit basis. Such regulation by the Chief of Police permitting use of the streets should be issued sufficiently in advance to permit appropriate publicity through news media and through other agencies such as the schools. It shall define the activity, the scope of the use of the streets permitted, the period of time involved, not to extend more than thirty (30) minutes beyond the time for termination of the activity, and the reason for finding that the regulation is reasonably necessary and is consistent with the purposes of this chapter.  
§ 137-7. - Severability. [ ] 
Severability is intended throughout and within the provisions of the Curfew Ordinance. If any provision, including any exemption, part, phrase or term or the application thereof to any person or circumstance, is held invalid, the application to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected thereby and the validity of the Curfew Ordinance in any and all other respects shall not be affected thereby. Additional exemptions to be included under § 137-6 will be considered by City Council as warranted by future experience illuminated by the views of student government associations, school personnel, citizens, associations, parents, officers and persons in authority concerned positively with minors as well as with juvenile delinquency. The Department of Public Safety shall be responsible to make periodic reviews of the practical aspects of enforcement and interpretation of this chapter, including the need for clarification or relaxation of any term or provision contained herein as well as the need for continued or discontinued curfew regulations. Whenever, in the opinion of the City Attorney or of any court, the application of this chapter to a particular act or activity of a minor is unclear or ambiguous, the less restrictive interpretation shall be deemed to be the intent of the chapter.

The Commission, upon its own initiative, may in like manner sign and file a complaint. The Commission, however, shall not accept a complaint from any person who has filed a complaint with the New Jersey State Division of Civil Rights with respect to the same grievance. The complainant shall have the power to reasonably and fairly amend any complaint, and the respondents shall have the power to amend their answer. 
B.

The notice shall also state that the complaint will be dismissed unless within ten (10) days after such service the complainant or his attorney file, with the office of the Human Rights Commission, a request for a review hearing. The Office of the Human Rights Commission shall upon request for such a hearing provide the complainant or his attorney, if any, an opportunity to appear before the Executive Director of the Human Rights Commission or a member of the Human Rights Commission or a staff representative of the Commission, at the election of the Commission, to present such additional information as may be available to support the allegations of the complaint. If after such a hearing the hearing agent determines that there is no basis for the allegation, the complaint shall be dismissed. There shall be no appeal from a decision of dismissal. A dismissal shall not be a bar to the filing of a complaint with the New Jersey Division of Civil Rights. 
D.  If, after such investigation, the Executive Director of the Human Rights Commission shall determine that probable cause exists for the allegations of the complaint, he or she may elect to: 
(1)  Eliminate the unlawful practice complained of by conference and conciliation. Such conference shall be opened to the public unless otherwise requested by one (1) or both of the parties to the conference; 
(2)  Sign a complaint against the alleged offending person for trial before the Municipal Court; or 
(3)  Refer the entire file to the City Prosecutor for such action as he or she may deem proper or necessary in the circumstances. 
E.  A person claiming to be aggrieved as set forth in this chapter may elect to file a complaint directly to the Municipal Court and prosecute the same on his or her own behalf or to pursue any other proper procedure that he or she may elect. 
F.  No complaint shall be considered unless it is filed with the Office of the Human Rights Commission within one hundred eighty (180) days after the alleged act of the discrimination.  
§ 148-7. - Failure to comply. 
In the event that the respondent refuses or fails to comply with any order of the Commission or violates any provisions of this chapter, the Commission shall cause to have a complaint filed in the Municipal Court for violation of the provisions of this chapter against the respondent.  
§ 148-8. - Violations and penalties. [Amended 12-11-1986 by Ord. No. C-298][1]

Chapter 157 - ENTERTAINMENT LICENSES 
[HISTORY: Adopted by the Council of the City of Jersey City 6-24-1998 by Ord. No. 98-081; amended 6-23-2004 by Ord. No. 04-062; 6-27-2007 by Ord. No. 07-122; 1-25-2012 by Ord. No. 12-001] 
 
§ 157-1. - Purpose and official comments. 
A.  Purpose; official comments. 
(1)  The City of Jersey City has repeatedly experienced serious civil disturbances and other occurrences detrimental to the public's safety, health and welfare associated with entertainment and dance venues (these problems include but are not limited to riots, disorderly groups, public consumption of alcohol, and public urination). Consequently, this chapter is enacted to license and regulate these activities except those directly sponsored and self-regulated by the city itself. 
(2)  Social clubs are expressly regulated by this chapter because recent experience has shown that attempts have been made to circumvent the general regulatory process. (For example, for-profit nightclubs have reorganized as private membership clubs to circumvent the Alcoholic Beverage Law.)* 
* Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 33:1-1 et seq. 
(3)  This chapter also prohibits obscene entertainment and obscene dancing and contains a definition of obscenity and pornography that reflects contemporary community standards as enforceable by relevant judicial decisions. It also explicitly incorporates by reference the prohibitions on pornography and obscenity found in Chapter 251 of the Municipal Code. In enacting this prohibition, the City Council relied on extensive evidence of long-standing community's standards. Testimony was taken from ordinary citizens as well as members of the clergy, teachers, business people and professionals. The Council issued legislative findings that the people of Jersey City are offended by obscenity and pornography: 
(a)  Jersey City seeks to maintain an atmosphere as conducive as possible to families in a densely populated urban setting. 
(b)  Obscenity and pornography have had no place in the public life of Jersey City. Historically, no so-called adult bookstores or adult theaters have operated here. In addition, no erotic dancing venues have ever been allowed to operate here in the city, notwithstanding their presence in adjacent communities. Therefore, these legislative findings support the existence of community standards that allow for the constitutional circumscription of such activity, and the city will continue to enforce these social norms through legal sanctions. 
(4)  The Director of the Division of Commerce is given primary jurisdiction over this chapter. However, given the public safety concerns, the Director of Public Safety also shares in its administration: § 157-9 authorizes the Director of Public Safety, upon a notice and hearing, to suspend licenses on an emergent basis. [Amended 1-25-2012 by Ord. No. 12-001; 9-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-081 ] 
B.  This chapter is to be liberally construed in order to effectuate its purpose.

ARTICLE I - Discharge of Firearms 
[Adopted 1-7-1975 by Ord. No. J-496 as Secs. 16-43 and 16-44 of the 1971 Jersey City Code, as readopted 9-19-1978 by Ord. No. S-128] 
 
§ 163-1. - Discharge restricted. 
The discharge of a firearm of any description, carelessly or without due caution and circumspection in a manner so as to endanger or be likely to endanger a person or property, is prohibited; provided that this section shall not be construed to apply to any officer of the law discharging a firearm in the performance of his duty.  
§ 163-2. - Violations and penalties. [Amended 6-14-1995 by Ord. No. 95-050] 
Any person violating any of the provisions of this Article shall, upon conviction, be punished as provided in Chapter 1, General Provisions, § 1-25.  
ARTICLE II - Toy Guns and Box Cutters 
[Adopted 6-11-1987 as Ord. No. C-468; amended in its entirety 4-24-1996 by Ord. No. 96-034] 
 
§ 163-3. - Sale, distribution and use restricted. 
A.  It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, expose for sale, distribute, possess or use toy guns in the City of Jersey City. 
B.  "Toy gun" means any toy facsimile of an actual firearm that can reasonably be perceived to be an actual firearm. [Amended 4-14-2010 by Ord. No. 10-049]  
§ 163-4. - Council findings. [ ] 
It has come to the attention of the Council that persons under the age of eighteen (18) have been purchasing devices sold as "box cutters" to carry on their person for purposes unrelated to their intended use. According to reports from the Department of Public Safety, Board of Education and the media, the purchase of box cutters by juveniles is increasing, and box cutters have been found in the possession of both students and others within Jersey City schools. Since these devices have blades which can be withdrawn into a handle or sheath, they can be concealed on one's person and used as weapons in fights and while committing crimes. It has been reported to the Council by school officials and through the media that persons under the age of eighteen (18) have used these devices to inflict serious injuries upon other youths and adults. From available reports, the sale and distribution of box cutters appears to have contributed to, and even aggravated, violent crimes by juveniles. The Council is of the opinion that it should use its municipal police powers to limit the sale and distribution of a device, the misuse of which aggravates criminal acts and causes severe injury to the victims of juvenile violence. Although the Council recognizes that these devices can be acquired outside the City of Jersey City, it believes nevertheless that it should not be made easy to acquire them within the city and that persons selling these devices should be required to assume the responsibility for their distribution to persons under the age of eighteen (18) who may use them for illegal acts.  
§ 163-5. - Sale of box cutters to minors prohibited; definitions of terms. 
"Box cutter" means any knife or similar device designed to cut cardboard, fiberboard and similar materials, having a razor-like blade which can be released from a handle or sheath by the application of hand pressure upon a button, slide or other device attached to the handle, sheath or blade.  
§ 163-6. - Sale and distribution to minors. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to sell any box cutter or similar device to a person under eighteen (18) years of age; except that the establishment by a preponderance of the evidence of all of the following facts by a person making the sale shall constitute an affirmative defense to any prosecution for violating this Article: 
A.  The purchaser falsely represented his or her age by producing a driver's license bearing a photograph of the licensee, or by producing a photographic identification card issued pursuant to § 1 of L. 1968, c. 313* or by producing a similar card purporting to be a valid identification card indicating that he or she was eighteen (18) years of age or older; 
* Editor's Note: See N.J.S.A. 33:1-81.2. 
(1)  Every person engaged in the business of selling box cutters shall maintain the box cutters in a secure area, either behind a counter or in a locked display case or other location where such box cutters are not accessible to the public. No box cutters shall be displayed on any open counter or any aisle or other area which is accessible to the general public entering a place of business. 
B.  The appearance of the purchaser was such that an ordinary prudent person would believe him or her to be eighteen (18) years of age or older; and 
C.  The sale was made in good faith relying upon the indicators of age listed in Subsections A and B above.  
§ 163-7. - Violations and penalties. 
Any person, firm or corporation who shall violate any of the provisions of this Article shall, upon conviction, be punishable as provided in Chapter 1, General Provisions, § 1-25; except that the minimum penalty for any violation shall be a fine of one hundred dollars ($100.).

§ 172-1.1. - Statutory authorization. [Amended 7-19-06 by Ord. No. 06-083] 
The Legislature of the State of New Jersey has in N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, et seq., delegated the responsibility to local governmental units to adopt regulations designed to promote public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the Municipal Council of the City of Jersey City, of New Jersey does ordain as follows:  
§ 172-1.2. - Findings of fact. [Amended 7-19-06 by Ord. No. 06-083] 
(1)  The flood hazard areas of [municipality] are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption or commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
(2)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.  
§ 172-1.3. - Statement of purpose. [Amended 7-19-06 by Ord. No. 06-083] 
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
(1)  To protect human life and health; 
(2)  To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer line, streets, bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
(6)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  To insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
(8)  To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their action.  
§ 172-1.4. - Methods of reducing flood losses. [Amended 7-19-06 by Ord. No. 06-083] 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this ordinance includes methods and provisions for: 
(1)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(2)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(3)  Controlling the alteration of natural flood plains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(4)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(5)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.  
§ 172-2.0. - Definitions and word usage. [Amended 3-12-1987 by Ord. No. C-427; 7-19-06 by Ord. No. 06-083]

§ 172-4.4-3. - Conditions for variances. [Amended 7-19-06 by Ord. No. 06-083] 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items 111 in Section 172-4.4-2 have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of historic structures (as defined by the chapter) without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section upon a determination that the proposed reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
(1)  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
(2)  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and 
(3)  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety or extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public identified in Section 172-4.4-1 D, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

ARTICLE III - Harassment and Eviction 
[Adopted 12-11-1986 as Ord. No. C-291] 
 
§ 218-7. - Findings. 
A.  The City Council finds that some owners and developers of residential buildings have engaged in the practice of harassing tenants in an effort to vacate the buildings so as to obtain substantially higher rentals for the dwelling units. Such practices often include the using or threatening to use force, disrupting or discontinuing essential services, failing to abate serious and often life-threatening code violations and removing a tenant's possessions. 
B.  Although state law protects tenants from unlawful evictions, a tenant's remedy for a landlord's unlawful acts is not always quick and efficient; and most tenants are unfamiliar with state judicial procedures. 
C.  The City Council believes that through appropriate regulations and restrictions, such unlawful practices can be curbed or prevented and the safety and welfare of tenants protected.  
§ 218-8. - Definitions.

(4)  Removing an occupant's possessions; 
(5)  Removing the entrance door or the lock to the entrance door; and 
(6)  Changing the lock or rendering it inoperable. 
C.  If an occupant vacates a dwelling unit on account of any of the acts listed in Subsection B, an owner shall take all reasonable and necessary steps to provide the occupant with a dwelling unit at a comparable rent within the dwelling suitable for occupancy, if the occupant makes such a request, and: 
(1)  The owner or an agent of the owner committed the unlawful acts; 
(2)  The owner knew or had reason to know about the unlawful acts; or 
(3)  The acts occurred within seven days prior to the occupant's request.  
§ 218-10. - Nonapplicability. 
The provisions of this article shall not apply to owner-occupied residential rental properties containing two rental units or less or a hotel, motel or other guesthouse or part thereof rented to transient guests or seasonal tenants.

A.  A violation of this article shall be punishable by a fine or imprisonment as set forth in Chapter 1, General Provisions, § 1-25. [2]

§ 222-5.6. - Enforcement. 
[Added 1-25-2017 by Ord. No. 17-007 ] 
A.  Violation of any provision of this ordinance shall be cause for a notice of violation (NOV) or a notice of penalty assessment (NOPA) document to be issued to the violator by the noise control officer or noise control investigator. 
B.  Any person who violates any provision of this ordinance shall be subject to a civil penalty for each offense of not more than the maximum penalty pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is $2,000.00. If the violation is of a continuing nature, each day during which it occurs shall constitute an additional, separate, and distinct offense. 
C.  Upon identification of a violation of this article the noise control officer or noise control investigator shall issue an enforcement document to the violator. The enforcement document shall identify the condition or activity that constitutes the violation and the specific provision of this article that has been violated. It shall also indicate whether the violator has a period of time to correct the violation before a penalty is sought. 
D.  If the violation is deemed by the noise control officer or noise control investigator to be a minor violation (as defined in section 222-2 of this article), an NOV shall be issued to the violator. 
(1)  The document shall indicate that the purpose of the NOV is intended to serve as a notice to warn the responsible party/violator of the violation conditions in order to provide them with an opportunity to voluntarily investigate the matter and voluntarily take corrective action to address the identified violation. 
(2)  The NOV shall identify the time period (up to ninety (90) days), pursuant to the Grace Period Law, N.J.S.A. 13:1D-125 et seq. where the responsible party's/violator's voluntary action can prevent a formal enforcement action with penalties issued by the City, or the Hudson Regional Health Commission. It shall be noted that the NOV does not constitute a formal enforcement action, a final agency action or a final legal determination that a violation has occurred. Therefore, the NOV may not be appealed or contested. 
E.  If the violation is deemed by the noise control officer or noise control investigator to be a non-minor violation the violator shall he notified that if the violation is not immediately corrected a NOPA with a civil penalty of no more than the maximum penalty allowed pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:49-5, which is two thousand dollars ($2,000.00) will be issued. If a non-minor violation is immediately corrected a NOV without a civil penalty shall still be issued to document the violation. If the violation occurs again (within three hundred sixty-five (365) days of the initial violation) a NOPA shall be issued regardless of whether the violation is immediately corrected or not. 
F.  The violator may request from the noise control officer or noise control investigator, an extension of the compliance deadline in the enforcement action. The noise control officer or noise control investigator shall have the option to approve any reasonable request for an extension (not to exceed 180 days) if the violator can demonstrate that a good faith effort has been made to achieve compliance. If an extension is not granted and the violation continues to exist after the grace period ends, a NOPA shall be issued. 
G.  The recipient of a NOPA shall be entitled to a hearing in a municipal court having jurisdiction to contest such action. 
H.  The noise control officer or noise control investigator may seek injunctive relief if the responsible party does not remediate the violation within the period of time specified in the NOPA issued. 
I.  Any claim for a civil penalty may he compromised and settled based on the following factors: 
(1)  Mitigating or any other extenuating circumstances; 
(2)  The timely implementation by the violator of measures which lead to compliance; 
(3)  The conduct of the violator; and 
(4)  The compliance history of the violator. 
J.  No provision of this ordinance shall be construed to impair any common law or statutory cause of action, or legal remedy there from, of any person for injury or damage arising from any violation of this ordinance or from other law.

This chapter may be cited as the "Property Maintenance Code" and may be referred to herein as "this chapter."  
§ 254-2. - Findings. 
A.  It is hereby found and declared that there are located within the city buildings used for residential and nonresidential purposes which have become or are becoming substandard with respect to structure, equipment, maintenance, occupancy, sanitation or use; and it is further declared that such conditions, which include but are not limited to lack of maintenance of exterior or interior of premises, faulty design, construction or installations, lack of proper sanitary facilities, fire or accident hazards, unsanitary conditions, infestation or overcrowding, have made these buildings either unfit for human habitation, occupancy or use or so deteriorated, dilapidated, dangerous, unsanitary, neglected or over-occupied as to jeopardize or be detrimental to the health, morals, safety or welfare of the people of the city. It also is recognized that to make housing more livable we must have homemaking and other social services as well as enforcement of the Property Maintenance Code's physical standards. 
B.  It is further found and declared that, among other reasons, because of lack of maintenance and progressive deterioration, certain properties have become blighted and have had the further effect of causing blighting conditions within the city that have necessitated an excessive and disproportionate expenditure of public funds for health, fire protection, public safety, welfare and other public services. However, it is further found and declared that through appropriate regulations and restrictions, as herein contained, the growth of blight and blighting conditions can be curbed or prevented and neighborhood and property values thereby maintained, the appearance and amenities of properties and neighborhoods can be enhanced and the public health, safety and welfare protected and fostered.

A.  The purpose of this Property Maintenance Code is to protect the public health, safety, morals and welfare and to eliminate and to prevent the spread of property and neighborhood deterioration and blight by establishing minimum standards governing the maintenance, appearance, condition and occupancy of residential and nonresidential premises; to establish minimum standards governing utilities and facilities of dwellings and other physical components and conditions in dwellings and nonresidential buildings essential to make the same fit for human habitation, occupancy or use; to fix certain responsibilities and duties upon owners and managers and distinct and separate responsibilities and duties upon occupants; to require the licensing and regulation of all boardinghouses and lodging houses; to authorize and establish procedures for the inspection of residential and nonresidential premises and for the general administration and enforcement of this chapter; to provide for the vacation and repair or demolition of premises unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use; to provide for the right of access across adjoining premises to permit repairs; and to fix penalties for violations of this chapter. This Property Maintenance Code is hereby declared to be remedial and essential for the public interest and it is intended that it be liberally construed to effectuate the purposes as stated herein. 
B.  The New Jersey State Housing Code, as amended from time to time, N.J.A.C. 5:28-1 et seq., is hereby adopted by reference as a supplement to the Jersey City Property Maintenance Code subject to the condition that the Jersey City Property Maintenance Code shall apply whenever it contains a standard more stringent than that contained in the New Jersey Housing Code.

(2)  Penalties. 
(a)  Where the Chief or his or her representative is refused entry or access or otherwise is impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant or manager from conducting an inspection of the premises when there is reason to believe a violation exists of an emergency character which is an immediate threat to health or safety, and therefor, immediate entry and action is required to protect the public health and welfare, such person shall be in violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties provided for in the general provisions of the Jersey City Code. [5]

Where such awnings or marquees are made of cloth, plastic or similar materials any and all parts of said materials exposed to public view shall be maintained in good condition free of discoloration, excessive weathering, holes or tears. Nothing herein shall be construed to authorize any encroachment on sidewalks, streets or other parts of the public domain.

Service of this notice shall occur not less than five (5) days prior to the commencement of any judicial proceedings and shall be made either personally or by mailing a copy of the notice by first class mail, postage prepaid, to them at the structure.

§ 254-52. - Failure to receive notice. 
The failure of any person or owner to receive actual notice of the determination by the Chief of Police shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the proceedings under this Article unless, and to the extent it shall be determined, that deprivation of notice substantially interfered with the owner's ability to abate any nuisance within the time period prescribed.  
§ 254-53. - Commencement of action. 
[Amended 9-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-081 ] 
A.  Civil proceeding. Concurrent with the notification procedures set forth above, the Chief of Police shall send a copy of the notice to the Director of Public Safety together with any other documentation which he or she believes supports the closure of the structure and the imposition of civil penalties. The Director of Public Safety shall then request the Corporation Counsel to commence civil proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction seeking the closure of the structure as well as the imposition of civil penalties against any and all of the owners thereof, and any such other relief as may be deemed appropriate. 
B.  Exception: agreement to abate conditions. Nothing contained in Subsection A shall be construed to limit the ability of the Director of Public Safety, prior to the institution of judicial proceedings, to enter into agreements with an owner willing to voluntarily abate the condition(s) giving rise to the violation.  
§ 254-54. - Stay of proceedings. 
Except in a proceeding under § 254-57, if, after commencement but prior to the trial of an action brought by the city pursuant to this Article, an owner specifically commits, in an enforceable manner, to pursue a course of action which is calculated to abate the conditions giving rise to the violation(s), the city shall agree to stay proceedings for a period of not less than ten (10) nor more than sixty (60) days. The owner or the Corporation Counsel may thereafter petition the court for such additional periods of time as may be necessary to complete the action(s) contemplated by the stipulation. However, in the event that the Corporation Counsel reasonably believes the owner is not diligently pursuing the action(s) contemplated by the stipulation, he or she shall then apply to the court for a release from the stay seeking relief, as is deemed appropriate.  
§ 254-55. - Burden of proof. 
In all actions seeking the closure of a structure as a specified crime property, the Corporation Counsel shall first determine that sufficient evidence exists to meet the burden of proof that the structure is a specified crime property. In all actions seeking civil penalties from an owner, the Corporation Counsel shall first determine that sufficient evidence exists to meet the burden of proof to show that the owner had actual or constructive knowledge of activities or conditions at the structure constituting a violation of this Article, on the basis of the notice provided hereunder or otherwise, and of the fact that the owner did not, thereupon, act to abate the activity or the conditions or circumstances giving rise to the activity, including but not limited to the commencement of eviction proceedings in the case of an offense by a tenant.  
§ 254-56. - Defense. 
It is a defense to an action seeking the closure of a structure or penalties that the owner of the subject property acted reasonably and diligently but could not, by the exercise of reasonable care or diligence, determine that the structure had been or was being used or maintained as a specified crime property and that, upon receipt of notice of such activity pursuant to this Article, all reasonable measures were taken to abate such activity, including but not limited to the institution of summary eviction proceedings or other forms of action calculated to prevent such activity from recurring on the property.  
§ 254-57. - Closure during pendency of action. 
In the event that it is determined that the structure is an immediate threat to the public health, safety and welfare, the Corporation Counsel shall apply to the court for such interim relief that is deemed to be appropriate. In such an event, the notification procedures set forth at § 254-50 and the limitation of § 254-54 need not be complied with.  
§ 254-58. - Enforcement of closure order; costs; penalty. 
A.  In the event that a structure constitutes a specified crime property, as defined in this Article, the Corporation Counsel shall pursue, on notice to all tenants affected and all lien holders of record, in addition to all other remedies, an order of the Superior Court that it, or any unit or area of it, be closed for any period of up to one (1) year and that the owner(s) pay to the city a civil penalty of up to five hundred dollars ($500.) for each day the owner had knowledge of activities or conditions at the structure constituting a violation of this Article and failed to undertake or maintain efforts of abatement. In the event that the enforcement of this Article requires an owner to institute tenancy eviction of partition proceedings, it shall be the duty of all appropriate officials of the City of Jersey City to provide testimony or evidence in such cause. 
B.  In establishing the amount of any civil penalty to pursue, the Corporation Counsel shall consider the following factors, if appropriate, and shall cite those found applicable. 
(1)  The actions taken by the owner(s) to mitigate or correct the problem at the structure. 
(2)  The financial condition of the owner(s). 
(3)  Whether the problem at the structure was repeated or continuous. 
(4)  The magnitude or gravity of the problem. 
(5)  The economic or financial benefit accruing or likely to accrue to the owner(s) as a result of the conditions at the structure. 
(6)  The cooperativeness of the owner(s) with the city. 
(7)  The cost to the city of investigating and correcting or attempting to correct the condition. 
(8)  Any other factor deemed by the Corporation Counsel to be relevant and worthy of consideration by the court. 
C.  The Corporation Counsel may seek orders authorizing the city or ordering the owner to physically secure the structure against use or occupancy in the event that the owner(s) fail to comply with other remedies agreed to or ordered by the court within the time specified. In the event that the city is authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the city to effect a closure shall be made an assessment lien upon the property. 
D.  The city bureau(s) effecting the closure shall be responsible for maintaining records and providing statements of costs for submission by the Corporation Counsel to the court.  
§ 254-59. - Relief from closure order. 
A.  The Corporation Counsel may enter into consent orders, with the approval of the court, with an owner of a structure determined to be specified crime property to provide relief from the court's judgment if the owner: 
(1)  Appears and pays all costs associated with the proceedings under this Article. 
(2)  Files a bond in such a place and form as the court may by order direct, in an amount not less than the tax assessed value of the structure and keeps such bond in force for a period of not less than one (1) year, or for such period as the court directs. 
(3)  Enters into a stipulation with the city that the owner shall immediately abate the conditions giving rise to the determination that the property is a specified crime property and prevent the same from being established or maintained thereafter. The stipulation will then made part of the court's record. 
B.  In the event that the owner violates the terms of the stipulation, the city may thereafter apply to the court for an order awarding up to the entire amount of the aforementioned bond to the city as a penalty, as well as such other relief, including closure for any additional period of up to one (1) year, that is deemed by the court to be appropriate.

NOTICE REGARDING ON STREET RESIDENTIAL PARKING PERMIT ZONES

[initials] Because an on-street residential parking permit is not available to residents of this building, I understand that if I rent or purchase a residence here, I will be required to pay for parking and I will NOT be eligible for an on-street residential parking permit unless I qualify for one of the exceptions. 
[initials] The landlord or seller informed me that off-street parking for a resident of this building is available at the rate of $_____ per month. 
[initials] I was shown this form and read it, prior to signing my lease or contract to purchase. 
[initials] I understand that if I am eligible for an exception, I am limited to one residential permit per unit. I am ineligible for any other residential permits.

E.  It shall be unlawful for any landlord to charge a tenant for the use of a washing machine, refrigerator, cooking stove, air conditioner or any other appliances wherever such appliances were permitted and allowed by the landlord without extra charge. The use of such appliances shall be considered as included in the former rents. Any such extra charge in such situation shall be considered as an unauthorized increase in rents and shall be unlawful unless approved by the Rent Leveling Board. Any landlord who has heretofore charged for such appliances shall be in violation of this chapter and shall be liable for punishment as such. 
F.  Any landlord seeking a major capital improvement rent increase based upon a substantial improvement of the dwelling and/or housing space must include in the notice to the tenant a landlord certification that said dwelling and housing space is in substantial compliance as defined by this chapter. All work done on the structure and premises must have been with approval of the appropriate agency or department as evidenced by requisite permits.

A certificate of occupancy, where required by law, and a certificate of code compliance, including a housing inspection report based upon an actual inspection made within six months of the date of the landlord's application, must be produced as evidence. For the purpose of this section only, "substantial improvement" shall mean that the cost of the capital improvements exceeds 50% of the current assessed value, as adjusted to 100% by the county tax equalization ratio prior to the improvements being made. 
(1)  If a landlord is determined to be in substantial compliance the increase shall be payable from the date set forth in the original notice of rent increase. 
(2)  If a landlord is determined not to be in substantial compliance at the time of the hearing, then the Board may grant provisional approval for the capital improvement and rent increase with such approval to be reviewed within six months. In the event that the subject property is brought into substantial compliance within the six-month period, then the provisional approval shall become final. 
(3)  In the event that the subject property is not brought into substantial compliance within the six-month period, but the owner has within this period made significant progress toward substantial compliance, the provisional approval shall continue with a further review being scheduled within the following three months. If the property is brought into substantial compliance within the additional three months, the provisional approval shall become final. 
(4)  In the event that the owner has not brought the property into substantial compliance or made significant progress toward substantial compliance within the six-month initial period or fails to bring the property into substantial compliance after being accorded the additional three-month extension, the owner provisional approval shall terminate and any capital improvement rent increase collected shall be immediately refunded to the tenant who paid the increase. 
(5)  Any capital improvement rent increase approved pursuant to this section shall take effect from the date of determination by the Board upon proper notice as required by the laws of the State of New Jersey. 
G.  Any landlord seeking a hardship increase shall include with the application an actual inspection report from the local building or property maintenance department based upon an inspection made within six months prior to the application. An application without said inspection report shall be void. The hearing officer may request an inspection if no inspection report is included in such application. The determination of substantial compliance shall be made by the Rent Leveling Board upon reviewing the list of violations, if any, set forth in the inspection report. If there are any objections thereto, then either party may file a complaint with the Board and a hearing shall be scheduled. The Chairperson of the Board shall intervene whenever necessary, upon request of any party to an application, to assure a prompt inspection by the appropriate department. 
(1)  If a landlord is determined to be in substantial compliance, then the hardship request shall be processed subject to the requirements set forth in § 260-10 of this chapter. 
(2)  If a landlord is determined not to be in substantial compliance at the time of the hearing on the hardship application, and the Board determines, after hearing, that the application would otherwise be granted, then the Board may grant provisional approval for the hardship application with such approval to be reviewed within six months. In the event that the subject property is brought into substantial compliance within the six-month period, then the provisional approval shall become final. 
(3)  In the event that the subject property is not brought into substantial compliance within the six-month period but the owner has, within this period, made significant progress toward substantial compliance, the provisional approval shall continue with a further review being scheduled within the following three months. If the property is brought into substantial compliance within the additional three months, the provisional approval shall become final. 
(4)  In the event that the owner has not brought the property into substantial compliance or made significant progress toward substantial compliance within the six-month initial period or fails to bring the property into substantial compliance after being accorded the additional three-month extension, the owner's provisional approval shall terminate and any rent increase collected shall be immediately refunded to the tenant who paid the increase. In the event that a provisional approval is so terminated, the Board shall dismiss the hardship application. An owner whose application has been so dismissed may reapply for a hardship rental increase. Any reapplication shall be considered an original application under § 260-10. 
[Amended 4-23-1987 by Ord. No. C-451] 
H.  The landlord shall register the rent roll with the Rent Leveling Bureau in order to qualify for any rental increase. 
I.  If the landlord does not inform or misinforms the tenant concerning the rent paid by the prior tenants or in any manner illegally increases the tenant's rent, the Rent Leveling Bureau shall then accept, hear and adjudicate a compliance of an illegal increase. 
J.  The landlord shall provide to each tenant a copy of the Truth-In-Renting Statement and subsequent amendments to said statement and be in full compliance with the landlord identity disclosure provision contained within the statement in order to qualify for any rental increase.  
§ 260-4. - Procedure for cost-of-living increases. 
Any landlord seeking a cost-of-living rental increase shall notify the tenant in writing at least 30 days prior to the effective date of the increase as required by law of the calculations involved in computing the increase, including the consumer price index three months prior to the expiration or termination of the lease and the commencement of the lease term, or for a periodic tenant whose lease term is less than one year, the consumer price index 15 months prior to the effective date of the proposed increase, the allowable percentage increase as per § 260-3 and the allowable rental increase. The notice shall state the tenant's right to contest the increase within six months to the Jersey City Rent Leveling Bureau.  
§ 260-5. - Capital improvement and service charge. 
A.  [Amended 3-11-1992 by Ord. No. 92-013] A landlord may apply to the Bureau of Rent Leveling for a service charge for increased or improved services. The landlord shall submit a written proposal with cost estimates to the Rent Leveling Board prior to performing any major or capital improvement work, showing how the work will affect all dwelling units. The landlord shall include the substance of said proposal in the notice of application to each tenant sent pursuant to Subsection C of this section. The aforesaid notice shall advise the tenants that they have a right to request a hearing before the Rent Leveling Board with respect to the proposed capital improvement work. Final approval by the Board shall not be considered until the capital improvement work has been completed and after the Board has received necessary documentation, at which time a final hearing will be scheduled. The landlord shall compute the average cost of the computed capital improvement or service by the number of years of useful life of the improvement as claimed by the landlord for federal income tax depreciation purposes. The landlord shall propose to apportion the average cost of completed improvement or service per year of useful life among the tenants in the dwelling in accordance with one of the following methods: 
(1)  If the capital improvement benefits certain housing spaces only, then the cost of those improvements shall be surcharged to only these units. 
(2)  If the capital improvement benefits all housing spaces but in varying degrees according to the amount of living area of each housing space, then the cost for the improvements shall be charged according to either the number of rooms or the space in proportion to the total rentable area in the dwelling. 
(3)  If the capital improvement is equally beneficial to all housing spaces regardless of the living area within any housing space, then the cost of the improvements shall be charged according to the number of housing spaces within the dwelling. 
B.  All work done on the property must be performed with the appropriate proper local approval as evidenced by permits and the completed capital improvements must be in accord with building, fire, plumbing, electrical and any other code regulations. Before any capital increase is approved, an inspection shall be required to be made by a qualified inspector of the Department of Housing, Economic Development and Commerce together with an inspection by the Office of the Construction Official in order to document the nature of the work performed and that the structure is in substantial compliance. A certificate of occupancy must be secured if required by law. The landlord shall furnish with the application a certification of the true cost of each improvement signed by a qualified inspector and an affidavit by the landlord that the amount claimed in the application is attributable only to the specific building which is the subject of the application. 
[Amended 3-11-1992 by Ord. No. 92-013; 8-13-1997 by Ord. No. 97-052] 
C.  Notice procedure. Prior to any application under this section, the landlord shall serve upon each tenant, by registered or certified mail or personal service of a notice of application filing setting forth the basis for said application, the amount of rental increase or surcharge applied for with respect to that tenant and the calculations involved. A sample copy of such notice shall be filed with the application of the landlord together with an affidavit or certification of service of notice of application upon each tenant. Tenants who request a copy of the complete application shall have one provided by the landlord. 
D.  Determination. The Rent Leveling Board may grant the landlord a rental surcharge or increase under the provisions of this section. No landlord shall impose upon any tenant a rent surcharge or increase under this section without first obtaining approval from the Rent Leveling Board.

§ 263-2. - Purpose; findings.[Amended 8-4-2010 by Ord. No. 10-101] 
A.  The purpose of this Article regulating business hours of restaurants and retail sales and services businesses on described portions of Communipaw Avenue, Franklin Street, Kennedy Boulevard, Martin Luther King Drive, Monticello Avenue, Ocean Avenue, Pacific Avenue, Palisade Avenue, Sip Avenue, Summit Avenue, and Paterson Plank Road and Secaucus Road is to: 
(1)  Decrease noise and disturbance associated with the large crowds of juveniles and young adults which congregate around retail businesses, especially fast-food businesses on these streets. 
(2)  Discourage the criminal activities, especially drug-related criminal activities, on these streets. 
B.  From evidence provided by residents of the neighborhoods of the vicinity of Communipaw Avenue, Franklin Street, Kennedy Boulevard, Martin Luther King Drive, Monticello Avenue, Ocean Avenue, Pacific Avenue, Palisade Avenue, Sip Avenue, Summit Avenue, and Paterson Plank Road and Secaucus Road, and by the Department of Public Safety, the City Council finds that: [ Amended 9-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-081 ] 
(1)  Retail fast food establishments and retail sales and services businesses on the described portions of these twelve (12) streets provide a haven for criminal activities and that these activities are difficult to control while these establishments remain open. 
(2)  Crowds of juveniles and young adults are attracted to the neighborhoods of the described portions of Communipaw Avenue, Franklin Street, Kennedy Boulevard, Martin Luther King Drive, Monticello Avenue, Ocean Avenue, Pacific Avenue, Palisade Avenue, Sip Avenue, Summit Avenue, and Paterson Plank Road and Secaucus Road, by fast food establishments and retail sales and services businesses, which remain open during late-night hours when such establishments in other parts of the city have closed. 
(3)  Encouraged by the presence of fast-food restaurants and retail sales and services businesses, these crowds of juveniles and young adults congregate not only on the main streets but on the adjoining residential streets and parking lots; residents of these neighborhoods who attempt to use the streets are harassed by panhandlers and by rowdy and even malicious juveniles. 
(4)  These youths and young adults create a disturbance in the neighborhood which prevents residents from sleeping and walking the streets and from enjoying the peace and quiet of their homes.

i.  A rectangular space four and five-eighths inches long and one and one-half inches wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting facilities); or 
ii.  A bar screen having a bar spacing of one-half inch. 
c.  Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars; or 
d.  Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property.

§ 285-1. - Findings. 
The Municipal Council finds that in light of the limited experience, education and emotional development of children under the age of seventeen (17), they are impressionable and susceptible to the influence of criminal conduct, particularly related to the sale and use of illegal drugs in our society. The display, distribution and sale of materials simulating drug paraphernalia is a contributing factor to juvenile crime and drug use, a basic factor in impairing the ethical and moral development of our youth and a clear and present danger to the people of the city. The city has a responsibility and an exigent interest to protect the welfare of its children and to see that they are safeguarded from influences which might prevent their growth into free and independent well-developed citizens by preventing the distribution to children of material deemed harmful to children. Therefore, the revisions hereinafter prescribed are enacted and their necessity in the public interest is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.  
§ 285-2. - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated: 
MATERIAL or MATERIALS SIMULATING DRUG PARAPHERNALIA - Any object which appears on cursory inspection to be an object commonly used by persons engaged in the possession, sale or use of illegal drugs, but which object is in fact not used for illegal purposes.

MINOR - Any person less than seventeen (17) years of old.  
§ 285-3. - Distributing material simulating drug paraphernalia to minors. 
A person is guilty of distributing material simulating drug paraphernalia to minors when, with knowledge of its character and content, he or she sells or conveys to a minor for monetary consideration any material simulating drug paraphernalia and which is harmful to minors.  
§ 285-4. - Presumption and defense. 
A.  A person who engages in the conduct proscribed by § 285-3 of this chapter is presumed to do so with knowledge of the character and content of the material sold or distributed. 
B.  In any prosecution for distributing material simulating drug paraphernalia to minors, it is an affirmative defense that: 
(1)  The defendant had reasonable cause to believe that the minor involved was seventeen (17) years old or more; and 
(2)  The minor exhibited to the defendant a draft card, driver's license, birth certificate or other official or apparently official document purporting to establish that such minor was seventeen (17) years old or more.

ARTICLE II - Uniform Packaging Practices 
[Adopted 7-18-1990 by Ord. No. McC-154] 
 
§ 287-32. - Findings; purpose. 
A.  Discarded packaging constitutes the largest single category of waste in the City of Jersey City and is, therefore, a necessary focus of any effort to reduce the amount of waste and the economic and environmental costs of waste management. 
B.  Discarded nondegradable packaging and plastic contained within the waste stream of the City of Jersey City is considered a fundamental cause of problems associated with municipal waste disposal and litter. 
C.  Disposal space is diminishing rapidly; solid waste receiving areas outside of the Hudson County area are becoming increasingly uncertain and expensive; for both economic and environmental reasons, measures to simplify the chemical complexity of solid waste and, thereby, streamline solid waste management must be vigorously pursued. 
D.  The chemical composition and ability of a substance to degrade are meaningful and useful criteria to focus upon when establishing public policy that is intended to improve the management and disposal of solid waste, reduce the cumulative impact of litter, encourage composting and other forms of recycling, minimize the potential for toxic substances to form if solid waste is burned, reduce the volume of ash by-products that may be created by any burning of waste plastic packaging and otherwise anticipate environmental problems that may be caused by the municipal solid waste disposal program. 
E.  The use of plastic nondegradable packaging has become widespread throughout the City of Jersey City and the resulting mixed substance waste stream is a serious impediment to many solid waste management programs being considered for the city. 
F.  The widespread use of plastics, especially polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride, pose a threat to the environment by causing unnecessary taking of landfill space or, when incinerated, by the possible introduction of toxic by-products into the atmosphere. 
G.  The economic and environmental problems associated with a mixed substance waste stream are so severe that a program to modify the composition of solid waste, thereby reducing environmental hazards and toxicity associated with solid waste incineration and encouraging the composting of putrescible biodegradable wastes and encouraging other forms of recycling of solid waste substances, is hereby determined to be a policy goal of the City of Jersey City. 
H.  The waste stream within Jersey City is so large and diverse that any program to establish policies and laws conducive to any waste management program in lieu of landfilling must identify and set new policy for those specific sources of waste packaging which originate with this city. 
I.  Certain retail establishments within Jersey City are points of origin for a significant volume of packaging waste and, therefore, are particularly susceptible to actions which have significant potential for simplifying the composition of this portion of Jersey City's solid waste stream, thereby improving solid waste management within this city. 
J.  The use of polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride for food packaging is problematic because neither of these plastics are readily recyclable; their abundant commercial use in lieu of other plastics, such as polyethylene or polypropylene, unnecessarily complicates the overall chemical composition of municipal waste and subtracts from the possible emergence of a viable plastic recycling market; if burned together, polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride leave a relatively heavier and more expensive ash residue to dispose of which may also create dioxin, hydrochloric acid or other toxic chemicals that could be emitted into the general environment once burned in a resource recovery facility. 
K.  There are readily available plastic and/or paper product substitutes for most of the polystyrene and polyvinyl chloride retail food packaging now being used in the City of Jersey City, the use of which alternatives would be environmentally and economically advantageous to the public of the City of Jersey City. 
L.  Plastic bags in the waste stream constitute an impediment to the development of efficient waste separation, recycling or other waste management programs and are less desirable than paper bags because plastic bags are neither recyclable nor compostable. 
M.  Plastic bags used by retail establishments selling food constitutes the largest single retail source of plastic bags in the waste stream. 
N.  The purpose of this article is to eliminate the use of nondegradable packaging originating at retail establishments within the City of Jersey City in order to protect the air, land and waters of the City of Jersey City against environmental contamination and degradation.  
§ 287-33. - Definitions. 
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings indicated:

Applicants seeking an exemption shall furnish a list of suppliers contacted to determine if substitutes are available. 
C.  The Director of the Division of Engineering, Traffic and Transportation may exempt any packaging not containing chlorofluorocarbons (CFC's) upon documented proof provided by the retail food establishment in a form as prescribed by and satisfactory to the Director of Engineering that recycling of this food packaging is occurring. The retail food establishment shall source-separate and remove the food packaging from the solid waste and shall cause the recycling of the packaging, in an organized manner, into another usable product thus preventing the packaging from being disposed. At minimum, the retail food establishment shall demonstrate monthly that at least sixty percent (60%) of said total packaging utilized is being recycled. This would include in the total that packaging being used within the premises as well as that taken from the premises.

The subdivider shall observe the following requirements and principles of land subdivision in the design of each subdivision or portion thereof: 
A.  General standards. The subdivision plat shall conform to design standards set for encouraging good development patterns within the city. Where an Official Map or Master Plan have been adopted, the subdivision shall conform to the proposals and conditions set therein. The streets, drainage rights-of-way, school sites, public parks and playgrounds as shown on an officially adopted Master Plan or Official Map shall be considered in approval of subdivision plats. Where no official map exists, streets and drainage rights-of-way shall be shown on the final plat in accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-39 and shall be such as to lend themselves to the harmonious development of the municipality and enhance the public welfare in accordance with the following design standards: 
B.  Street standards. 
(1)  The arrangement of streets not shown on the Master Plan or Official Map shall be such as to provide for the appropriate extension of existing streets. 
(2)  Minor streets shall be so designed as to discourage through traffic. 
(3)  Subdivisions abutting arterial streets shall be provided with a buffer strip for planting or some other means of separation of through and local traffic as the Planning Board may determine appropriate.

(5)  No subdivision showing reserve strips controlling access to streets shall be approved except where the control and disposal of land comprising such strips has been placed in the governing body under conditions approved by the Planning Board. 
(6)  Subdivisions that adjoin or include existing streets that do not conform to width as shown on the Master Plan or Official Map or the street width requirements of this chapter shall dedicate additional width along either one or both sides of the said road. If the subdivision is along one (1) side only, one-half (½) of the required extra width shall be dedicated. 
(7)  Grades of arterial streets shall not exceed four percent (4%). Grades of other streets shall not exceed ten percent (10%). 
(8)  Street intersections shall be as nearly at right angles as is possible and in no case shall be less than sixty degrees (60°). The block corners at intersections shall be rounded at the curbline with a curve radius of not less than twenty-five (25) feet for residential development and fifty (50) feet for industrial development. 
(9)  Street jogs with center-line offsets of less than one hundred twenty-five (125) feet shall be prohibited. 
(10)  Dead-end streets (culs-de-sac) shall not be longer than six hundred (600) feet and shall provide a turnaround at the end with a radius of not less than thirty (30) feet and tangent wherever possible to the right side of the street. 
(11)  If a dead-end street is of temporary nature, a similar turnaround shall be provided and provisions made for future extension of the street and reversion of the excess right-of-way to the adjoining property. 
(12)  No street shall have a name which will duplicate, or nearly duplicate, the names of existing streets. The continuation of an existing street shall have the same name. All streets shall be approved by the Planning Board. 
C.  Block standards. 
(1)  Block length and width shall be of sufficient acreage so as to accommodate the size of lots required by Chapter 345, Zoning, and shall provide convenient access, circulation, control and safety of street traffic. 
(2)  In blocks over one thousand (1,000) feet long, pedestrian crosswalks may be required in locations deemed necessary by the Planning Board. Such walkway shall be ten (10) feet wide, landscaped and be straight from sidewalk to sidewalk. 
D.  Lot standards. 
(1)  Lot dimensions and area shall not be less than the requirements of Chapter 345, Zoning. 
(2)  So far as is practical, side lot lines shall be at right angles to straight streets and radial to curved streets. 
(3)  Each lot shall front upon an improved street, except in those instances conforming with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-35 and 40:55D-36. 
(4)  Where land has been dedicated for a widening of existing streets, lots shall begin at such new street line and all setbacks shall be measured from such lines. 
E.  Public use and service area standards. 
(1)  In a large-scale development, easements along rear property lines or elsewhere for utility installations may be required. Such easements shall be at least fifteen (15) feet wide and located after consultation with whose companies and municipal departments concerned. 
(2)  Where a subdivision is traversed by a watercourse, drainageway channel or stream, there shall be provided a stormwater easement or drainage right-of-way conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse and such further width and construction, or both, as would be adequate for the purpose. 
(3)  Natural features such as trees, brooks, hilltops and views shall be preserved wherever possible in designing any subdivision containing such features.  
§ 299-6. - Violations and penalties. 
A.  If, before favorable approval by the Planning Board has been obtained, any person transfers or sells or agrees to sell as owner or agent any land which forms a part of a subdivision on which the Planning Board is required to act, such person shall be subject to a fine not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.), and each parcel, plat or lot so disposed shall be deemed a separate violation ( N.J.S.A. 40:55D-55). 
B.  In addition to the foregoing, if the streets in the subdivision are not such that a structure on said land in the subdivision would meet requirements for a building permit, the city may institute and maintain a civil action: 
(1)  For injunctive relief; 
(2)  To set aside and invalidate any conveyance made pursuant to such a contract or sale if a certificate of compliance has not been issued in accordance with Section 44 of the Municipal Land Use Law ( N.J.S.A. 40:55D-56) but only if the municipality has a Planning Board. 
C.  In any such action, the transferee, purchaser or grantee shall be entitled to a lien upon the portion of land from which the subdivision was made that remains in the possession of the subdivider or his assigns or successors, to secure the return of any deposit made or purchase price paid, and also a reasonable search fee, survey expense and title-closing expense, if any. Any such action must be brought within two (2) years after the date of the recording of the instrument of transfer, sale or conveyance of such land, or within six (6) years, if unrecorded ( N.J.S.A. 40:55D-55).  
§ 299-7. - Vacancies. 
These rules, regulations and standards shall be considered the minimum requirements for the protection of the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of Jersey City. Any action taken by the Planning Board under the terms of this chapter shall give primary consideration to the above-mentioned matters and to the welfare of the entire community. However, if the subdivider or his agent can clearly demonstrate that, because of peculiar conditions pertaining to his land, a literal enforcement of one (1) or more of these regulations is impracticable or will exact undue hardship, the Planning Board may permit such variance or variances as may be reasonable and within the general purpose and intent of the rules, regulations and standards established by this chapter ( N.J.S.A. 40:55D-51).

[Added 11-20-2018 by Ord. No. 18-133 ] 
A.  Remedies not mutually exclusive. The remedies provided in this section are not mutually exclusive. The utilization by the Director of one remedy does not preclude utilization of the other. Moreover, any use of the remedies provided in these sections does not preclude the use by the City of any other legal or administrative procedure which can bring about compliance by the taxpayer with the provisions of this chapter, 
B.  Suits for recovery of unpaid taxes. The Director may sue in the name of the City in law or in equity, for the recovery of those payroll taxes due and unpaid under the provisions of the payroll tax, to compel the production of records or to enforce any other provisions of the law. 
C.  Limitations. 
1.  The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of payroll taxes: 
i.  When a return has been filed but no tax paid, any suit brought to recover the tax due and unpaid shall be filed within three years after the return was due or filed, whichever is later. Where no return was filed or a fraudulent return was filed, there shall be no limits to file suit for the collection of taxes. 
ii.  A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the due date. 
iii.  Extension by agreement. Where, before the expiration of the time prescribed in this section for the filing a lawsuit against the taxpayer, both the Director and the taxpayer have consented in writing to its extension after such time, the suit may be filed at any time prior to the expiration of the period agreed upon. The period so agreed upon maybe extended by subsequent agreements in writing made before the expiration of the period previously agreed upon. 
D.  Penalty and interest. 
1.  If for any reason the payroll tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate of eight percent per annum on the first $1,500.00 of the delinquency and 18 percent per annum on any amount in excess of $1,500.00 shall be added to the tax. 
2.  On any additional tax determined to be due as a result of a deficiency assessment, penalty and interest will be assessed from the date the tax should have been paid to the date of payment. Penalty and interest is calculated as described above in the applicable portion of subsection 1. 
3.  Where suit is brought for the recovery of such tax, the person liable therefore shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection and the interest and penalties herein imposed. Once due and owing, penalty and interest become part of the tax and shall be collected as such. A person's belief that no tax is due and owing, or the failure of any person to receive or obtain the forms required for making the returns required under this chapter is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties herein for violation. Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty. 
E.  Fines and penalties for violations. 
1.  Violations. No person shall: 
i.  Fail, neglect or refuse to make any return or provide any reports required by this chapter. 
ii.  Refuse to permit an officer or agent designated by the Director to examine the books, records, papers or accounts of any business taxable or otherwise to determine liability. 
iii.  Knowingly make any incomplete, false or fraudulent report or attempt to do anything whatever to avoid full disclosure of the amount of payroll tax due to avoid the payment in whole or in part of the payroll tax. 
2.  In addition to any other penalties or enforcement proceedings provided for the collection and enforcement of payroll taxes by applicable law, any person who commits a violation of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine of not less than $100.00 and not exceeding $2,000.00, imprisonment for a term not exceeding 90 days and/or a period of community service not exceeding 90 days.

3.  The fines and terms of imprisonment imposed under this section shall be in addition to any other relief granted to the City of a monetary nature under the provisions of this chapter. 
F.  Certificate of indebtedness. Upon making an assessment of payroll tax or additional payroll tax, the Director may issue a certificate of indebtedness, which shall be filed with the Clerk of the Superior Court to record as a judgment against the Employer.

C.  Refunds.

3.  Erroneous refund recovery. The Director may sue for recovery of an erroneous refund provided such suit is begun two years after making such refund, except that the suit may be brought at any time if any part of the refund was induced by fraud or misrepresentation of material fact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Director may file a law suit within the limitations period under Section 304-19.4.C of this chapter, if such period ends after the two-year period specified in the preceding sentence. 
D.  Appeals. Any aggrieved employer may, within 90 days after the mailing of any final notice regarding a decision, order, finding assessment or action of the Director, appeal to the tax court in accordance with the provisions of the State Tax Uniform Procedure Law, N.J.S.A. 54:48-1 et seq. by filing a petition of appeal and upon payment of the amount stated by the Director to be due. The appeal provided by this section shall be the exclusive remedy available to any employer for review of a final decision of the Director in respect to a determination of liability for the tax imposed by this chapter. If no such appeal is filed on a timely basis, the aggrieved party waives his right to contest any element of the Director's adjudication, and that party's failure to challenge the same will be construed as an admission by that party as to the propriety of the Director's decision. No hearing or appeal will operate to suspend the accrual of penalty and interest from the date the tax was due to the date it is actually paid.

[Amended 3-14-2012 by Ord. No. 12-017; 9-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-081 ] 
A.  The Director of Public Safety is hereby authorized and directed to establish a just and equitable rotating system of licensees to be summoned: 1) to tow away and store a disabled vehicle, and 2) if there is more than one Impound Operator license issued, Impound Operator licensees. The rotating system shall be established so as to give as nearly as is practicable an equal share of the towing business to each licensee and to furnish protection to the owners of disabled vehicles. There shall be a separate list for Class I and II Vehicles and Class III vehicles with specific equipment requirements for each list to be promulgated by the Director of Public Safety; however, at minimum, a tower on the light-duty list shall have two tow trucks and a flatbed, and a tower on the heavy-duty list shall have two heavy-duty tow trucks. The Director of Public Safety shall be guided by the following minimum requirements for the rotating system: 
(1)  Only a Class A licensee may be in the rotation system and shall not have more than one position on the rotating list regardless of how many supplemental licenses the licensee shall hold. 
(2)  A licensee tower on the rotating list shall not be removed therefrom before he or she is accorded an opportunity to be heard after receiving written charges preferred against the licensee. No licensee shall lose his or her turn in the rotating system until the licensee is accorded this opportunity to be heard; provided, however, that the Director of Public Safety may immediately suspend any licensee if it is determined to be in the best interests of the citizens or the rotation system. A licensee may request in writing to be removed from the rotating list. When so removed, the licensee shall not be eligible to be placed on the rotating list for a period of one year from the date removed. 
(3)  Each licensee in the rotating system shall be given equal time and opportunity as all other licensees in the rotating system, and there shall be no discrimination for any reason whatsoever. 
(4)  No police officer or other official of the city shall have any authority to remove or skip over any licensee in the rotating system. If any licensee commits any violation of the motor vehicle laws of the State of New Jersey, the proper action taken against such licensee shall be by way of summons for the motor vehicle violation. If the infraction involves a violation of this chapter or any provision of the Jersey City Code, charges specifying the offense shall be presented to the Director of Public Safety, who shall thereupon cause a hearing to be held in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(5)  Licensees shall respond to the scene within twenty (20) minutes of a request for service by the Department of Public Safety. If a tower does not respond within the allowed time and another tower is called to respond, the first tower may be suspended for up to three (3) days or for repeat offenders removed from the list for up to a year at the discretion of the Director of Public Safety, upon notice and an opportunity to be heard. 
B.  Whenever it is necessary to have a disabled vehicle towed away, the police who arrive at the scene shall forthwith notify police headquarters to summon a licensed tower from the rotating list in accordance with the procedure established by the Director of the Department of Public Safety, except when an emergency has been declared by the Office of Emergency Management. 
[Amended 2-23-2011 by Ord. No. 11-025] 
C.  The owner or driver of a disabled vehicle shall use the services of the licensed tower summoned by the police unless the owner is a member of an organization which supplies towing services for its members and the owner or driver requests the use of such organization's tower. If the request is made to the police at the scene, the police shall forthwith notify police headquarters to call the organization and relay the request and all necessary information supplied by the owner's membership card to the organization. 
D.  In the event that the tower summoned by the police is delayed and it is necessary to remove the disabled vehicle out of the line of traffic or for other safety reasons, then the police emergency tower may remove the vehicle to the nearest point out of the way of the free flow of traffic allowing the vehicle to remain there until towed away by the tower summoned by the police. 
E.  In the event that a disabled vehicle is towed away and stored by a licensee pursuant to this chapter and the owner of the vehicle or such owner's agent or next of kin does not authorize a further disposition of the vehicle within three days after it is towed to the storage place, the licensee may, upon giving written notice by certified mail to the owner or the owner's authorized agent, pursue any and all remedies he or she may have in law for the disposition of the vehicle and the collection of the fees. 
F.  In the event that the owner or driver of the disabled vehicle is incapacitated by reason of injuries or otherwise and is unable to authorize the further disposition of the vehicle after it is towed away by the licensee, then the licensee shall forthwith ascertain from the police the name and address of the owner's agent or next of kin and contact him or her to ascertain the further disposition of the vehicle. The licensee shall also send to said agent or next of kin the bill for services and a copy of the schedule of prices as is required by this chapter.

For a vehicle that is not claimed by the owner or person entitled to claim the vehicle, the City shall sell the vehicle at public auction pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:10A-1 et seq. The sale proceeds shall be used to reimburse the impound operator for the paving the tower and to pay the impound operator's storage fee. The storage fee shall be calculated using the rates set forth in Section 319-11.C of this Chapter. If the auction proceeds are not sufficient to pay these fees, the City shall transfer the vehicle to the Impound Operator.

No parking meters shall be installed in areas where parking is prohibited pursuant to the provisions of N.J.S.A. 39:4-138. The Division of Parking Enforcement shall be responsible for the regulation, control, operation, maintenance and use of such parking meters. Each device shall be so set as to display a signal showing legal parking upon the deposit of the appropriate coin, lawful money of the United States of America, for the period of time prescribed in this Article. Each device shall be so arranged that upon the expiration of the lawful time limit, it will indicate by a proper, visible signal that the lawful parking period has expired, and in such case the right of such vehicle to occupy such space shall cease, and the operator, owner, possessor or manager thereof shall be subject to the penalties hereinafter provided. [Amended 11-12-2014 by Ord. No. 14-017 ] 
B.  No parking meter shall be installed in any area in conflict with the provisions of N.J.S.A. 30:4-138 which prohibits vehicles to stand or park in certain locations.  
§ 332-50. - Operation of parking meters. 
A.  Except in a period of emergency determined by an officer of the Department of Public Safety, or in compliance with the directions of a police officer or traffic control sign or signal, when any vehicle shall be parked in any parking space alongside or next to which a parking meter is located, the operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the said parking meter space, immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in said meter such proper coin of the United States of America as is required for such parking meter and as is designated by proper directions on the meter, and when required by the directions on the meter, the operator of such vehicle, after the deposit of the proper coin, shall also set in operation the timing mechanism on such meter in accordance with directions properly appearing thereon, and failure to deposit such proper coin and to set the timing mechanism in operation when so required shall constitute a violation of this Article. Upon the deposit of such coin (and the setting of the timing mechanism in operation when so required), the parking space may be lawfully occupied by such vehicle during the period of time which has been prescribed for the part of the street in which said parking space is located, provided that any person placing a vehicle in a parking meter space adjacent to a meter which indicates that unused time has been left in the meter by the previous occupant of the space shall not be required to deposit a coin so long as his occupancy of said space does not exceed the indicated unused parking time. If said vehicle shall remain parked in any such parking space beyond the parking time limit set for such parking space and if the meter shall indicate such illegal parking, then and in that event such vehicle shall be considered as parking overtime and beyond the period of legal parking time, and such parking shall be deemed a violation of this Article. [Amended 9-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-081 ] 
B.  When more than one (1) parking space is required within a parking meter zone to legally park a vehicle, the operator of such vehicle shall, upon entering the parking meter spaces, immediately deposit or cause to be deposited in each meter of spaces so occupied, a proper coin of the United States as required for such parking meters.  
§ 332-51. - Manner of parking. 
When a parking meter space is parallel with the adjacent curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter space is diagonal to the curb or sidewalk, no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; when a parking meter shall have been installed at the head of and immediately adjacent to any parking space on a municipal off-street parking lot, no person shall park or permit the parking of any vehicle in such parking space in any other position than with the foremost part of such vehicle nearest to the parking meter; provided, however, that in municipal off-street parking lots, signs shall be erected indicating that head-on parking only is permitted. In any event, a vehicle shall be parked within the lines marked on the pavement measuring such parking space.  
§ 332-52. - Violations. 
[Amended 11-22-2016 by Ord. No. 16-180 ] 
It shall be unlawful and a violation of the provisions of this Article for any person to: 
A.  Cause, allow, permit or suffer any vehicle registered in the name of or operated by such person to be parked overtime or beyond the period of legal parking time established for any parking meter zone as herein described, or to deposit in any parking meter any coin for the purpose of parking beyond the maximum legal parking time for the particular parking meter zone. 
B.  Permit any vehicle to remain or be placed in any parking space adjacent to any parking meter while said meter is displaying a signal indicating that the vehicle occupying such parking space has already been parked beyond the period prescribed for such parking space. 
C.  Park any vehicle across any line or marking of a parking meter space or in such position that the vehicle shall not be entirely within the area designated by such lines or markings.

A.  The City of Jersey City may, for good cause shown, establish by ordinance restricted parking zones in front of or near residences occupied by disabled drivers, provided that such parking is not otherwise prohibited and does not interfere with the normal flow of traffic. No restricted parking zones will be established for persons who do not transport themselves and who do not possess a valid disabled person identification card and placard or license plate issued by the State of New Jersey, Division of Motor Vehicles, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-205 and 39:4-206 unless the Municipal Council determines that: 
(1)  The nondisabled driver resides in the same household as the disabled person (documentation must be provided). 
(2)  The disabled person needs to be transported at least five (5) days per week to work, school or other educational or gainful activity (documentation must be provided detailing where, when and why the disabled person is transported). 
(3)  The disabled person's disability is such that it would preclude the disabled person from waiting on the sidewalk until the nondisabled driver arrives with the car or finds parking (documentation must be provided detailing the extent of the disability). 
(4)  The parking conditions in the disabled person's immediate neighborhood warrant this exception; and 
(5)  A reasonable person would deem it highly unusual and unjust to deny a restricted parking zone even in light of the competing demands for parking spaces within a given neighborhood. 
B.  No restricted parking zones will be established for applicants who have a driveway, carport, garage or off-street space available for their use unless the Municipal Council determines that: 
(1)  Such driveway, garage or space cannot accommodate the driver's vehicle; or 
(2)  The driver has need of a specially equipped vehicle which cannot be reasonable accommodated by such carport, garage or space. 
C.  The term "disabled" means a condition wherein a person has lost the use of one (1) or more lower limbs as a consequence of paralysis, amputation or other permanent disability or who is permanently disabled as to be unable to ambulate without the aid of an assisting device or whose ambulation is otherwise severely limited. In any case, the severity of the mobility disability shall be similar to or approximate disablement by reason of amputation. 
D.  Notarized applications for the establishment of restricted parking zones shall be filed with the Jersey City Division of Engineering, Traffic and Transportation, which shall investigate each application for compliance with Subsection A. The application shall be accompanied by a medical evaluation form completed by the applicant's personal physician. The personal physician shall include a certification stating that the applicant has a mobility disability as described in Subsection 332-69 C. Application forms and medical evaluation forms can be obtained from the Division. Thereafter, the Division shall notify the applicant when and where to report for a medical examination or, in the alternative, shall notify the applicant of the person to contact to arrange such medical examination. The examining physicians shall be selected by the Municipal Council Committee on Parking for the Disabled. The cost of examination shall be borne completely by the applicant. The applicant shall bring to the examination any and all medical or other documentation which he or she believes relevant to the applicant's medical condition. Such documentation may include, but will not be limited to X-ray reports, C.T. scan reports, cardiograms, hospital and surgical records and attending physicians' reports. If the examining physician does not possess adequate documentation to verify the applicant's eligibility under Section 332-69 C and cannot by application alone verify such eligibility, the applicant shall be rejected. An application filed by a tenant shall also be served upon the landlord. 
E.  If the City Council so approves, the Municipal Engineer shall establish a restricted parking zone in front of or near the residence of the applicant and shall issue a permit which complies with N.J.S.A. 39:4-197.7. Only the motor vehicle for which a valid permit has been issued shall be parked in such zone and only when the permit is properly displayed. Only one (1) permit shall be issued to the applicant. No restricted parking zones, other than those granted by the Department of Public Safety in emergencies, shall be approved except in the manner provided in this section. [Amended 9-11-2013 by Ord. No. 13-081 ] 
F.  No more than one (1) restricted parking space shall be granted at any one (1) building address where the building is comprised of six (6) dwelling units or less, and no more than two (2) disabled parking space shall be granted at any one (1) building address where the building is comprised of seven (7) dwelling units or more. At any address from which a disabled parking space or spaces have already been granted, any additional permits approved for that address shall bear the same permit number as exists for the space already granted. Such space or spaces may be used by anyone possessing the corresponding numbered permit on a first come, first served, basis. This provision shall apply only to applications approved or denied after the effective date of this amendment. 
G.  Restricted parking spaces and permits shall be valid for two (2) years and shall be renewed thereafter in accordance with the requirements of this Article. A permit may be reviewed earlier if conditions concerning the applicant change. 
H.  Any party denied a restricted parking zone shall have the opportunity to request reconsideration of such decision. A letter requesting reconsideration must be received by the Division of Engineering, Traffic and Transportation within twenty (20) days of the date of the notice of denial. The applicant will then be instructed to report for a reexamination with an examining physician and/or in appropriate cases, the committee, or its designee, may hold a hearing to reconsider any relevant evidence pertaining to the applicant's eligibility. As in the initial medical examination, costs for this reexamination shall be borne by the applicant. It shall be the applicant's responsibility to bring to the examination any and all documentation in support of his or her condition. The applicant will be notified by mail of the decision on reconsideration. No more than one (1) reconsideration will be given each applicant. Thereafter, the applicant may reapply after one (1) year has elapsed from the date of the notice of denial. 
I.  Any party willfully presenting false information or documentation to the Committee or found to be abusing any parking privileges granted under this Article shall be subject to loss and/or denial of such privileges.  
§ 332-70. - Existing restricted parking zones. 
All persons with existing restricted parking zones which do not comply with this Article are hereby canceled six (6) months after the effective date of this article. The Municipal Engineer shall establish fair and uniform procedures to assure that each holder of an existing permit is afforded an opportunity to present evidence of compliance. Such procedures shall provide that notice of cancellation be sent to all persons with existing restricted parking zones at least forty-five (45) days before the cancellation of such permit.  
§ 332-71. - Municipal Engineer to issue regulations establishing restricted parking spaces. 
A.  The Municipal Engineer may, by regulation, establish restricted parking zones in front of schools, hospitals and other public buildings and in public parking facilities and in shopping and business districts for use by persons who have been issued special vehicle identification cards by the Division of Motor Vehicles pursuant to N.J.S.A. 39:4-205 when using a motor vehicle on which is displayed a certificate for which a special vehicle identification card has been issued. 
B.  All regulations establishing restricted disabled parking spaces pursuant to Subsection A above and the location of such spaces are available for review in the Office of the City Clerk and in the Division of Engineering, Traffic and Transportation.  
§ 332-71.1. - Restricted parking; spaces for the disabled. 
[Amended 11-16-2017 by Ord. No. 17-149 ] 
The parking spaces below are hereby designated as reserved for vehicles transporting the disabled. Vehicles parked in the reserved parking space must display the Special Vehicle Identification (hang tag) issued by the Motor Vehicle Commission on Wheelchair License Plates. 
Name of Street 	Side 	Parking Spaces 
Robinson Dr 	Counterclockwise Robinson Dr to Lee Ct 	290 degree/angle spaces 
 
Regulatory, parking and warning signs shall be erected and maintained to affect the above designated regulatory and parking prohibitions and restrictions pursuant to New Jersey State Statutes and Amendments and the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. 
Tow away zones. Any vehicle parked or standing as to obstruct or impede a normal flow of traffic, block entrances or exit ways, loading zones, oil fill, any grassy area, pedestrian walkway, or present in an way a safety or traffic hazard may be removed by towing the vehicle at the owners or operators expense. 
The Provisions of Title 39, Subtitle 1 are hereby made applicable to Society Hill at Droyers Point, including all roads, streets, driveways, terraces, parking areas and other roadways with the area commonly known as Society Hill at Droyers Point, and open to or used by the public, tenants and employees for the purpose of vehicular traffic. 
Editor's note Ord. No. 17-149 , adopted November 16, 2017, amended the Code by adding a new § 332-71. In order to prevent duplication of section numbers, the provisions have been renumbered as § 332-71.1 at the discretion of the editor.

Sec. 108. Air-conditioning and refrigeration equipment. 
A.  All water cooled air-conditioning equipment, refrigeration machinery and compressor installations discharging water into the city sewerage system shall be subject to the city's inspection and approval. Such installations shall be free of any possibility of cross-connections or back siphonage in case of low pressure in the city water main, and the connection of the installation with water and waste pipes shall be done by a licensed plumber of the City of Jersey City. A written permit will be required from the Office of Permit Clerk for each installation for which a charge, as provided in Chapter 160, Fees and Charges, will be made, which charge will include the expense of regular inspection. Extra charges will be made for additional inspections required on account of condemnation of work or for premature request for inspection. 
B.  Applications for permits for units heretofore or hereafter installed shall be signed by both the licensed master plumber and the owner of the premises where the installation will take place. The application will further specify the type of dwelling, store, commercial establishment or industrial plant to be served, and the maximum rating as to capacity of the unit in tons of refrigeration and the horsepower required under maximum summer operating conditions, the number of units to be installed, the manufacturer's rating for water consumption per unit, the type of water conservation equipment to be installed and such additional information regarding the proposed installation as may be required by the Department. In no case shall the rated capacity of the refrigeration unit in tons be considered less than the nameplate horsepower of the driving equipment for the purpose of this code. In the absence of the required manufacturer's maximum rating as to capacity of the unit in tons of refrigeration for the purpose of this code, the Department may specify the tonnage of the refrigeration unit by using the nameplate horsepower of the driving unit. In case water conservation devices are required to comply with Subsection C, the name of the manufacturer and the guarantee on the water conservation device are to be given for maximum anticipated summer operating conditions, together with the manufacturer's identifying data on the equipment. Approval must be obtained before installation of the equipment is started.

Units of five-ton capacity and under which do not have water conservation devices shall be provided with an automatic water regulating device so as to limit the use of water under maximum summer conditions to not more than two gallons per minute per ton of refrigeration. 
(2)  Makeup water connections to a water conservation device are to be so arranged that the supply has a physical break between the city water main and said device so it will be impossible for water to siphon back in case of low pressure in the city water main. 
D.  Water from any such installation shall not be discharged into the city's sewerage system at a rate in excess of the foregoing, and discharged wastewater shall be in strict accordance with Plumbing Code of Jersey City and any other department having jurisdiction. 
E.  The Chief Engineer of the Department shall be satisfied that the system can be operated without adversely affecting the flow to other uses of water in the area or becoming detrimental to public safety. The city reserves the right to restrict or prohibit the use of water that is not considered essential to the health and welfare of the people during any water emergency period that may be caused by depleted storage reservoirs due to drought periods or other adverse conditions of nature, breaks in transmission mains or any part of the water system causing a water shortage or threatened water shortage. The city reserves the right to restrict or prohibit extraordinary use of water if water supply conditions so require. The city is not required to maintain any minimum pressure other than that required to deliver water into the basement of any premises. 
F.  All water cooled air-conditioning equipment, refrigeration machinery and compressor installations using water from the city main or discharging water into the city sewerage system, installed or in operation prior to the adoption of this code, shall be required to make such water cooled air-conditioning equipment, refrigeration machinery or air compressor installations conform to the terms of this code, and the owner or operator of said equipment shall have one year from the adoption of this code to comply with the provisions hereto provided for. 
G.  In the event that an owner or occupant fails to make the water cooled air-conditioning equipment, refrigeration machinery or compressor installations conform with the terms of this code and specifically in violation of Section 6 hereof, then the city shall have the right to discontinue the water service to the property in accordance with Section 129 of this code.

A.  Establishment of an Artist Certification Board. [Amended 9-9-2009 by Ord. No. 09-093] 
1.  There is hereby created an Artists' Certification Board (ACB), which shall serve as a citizens' advisory board to the Planning Board, pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-27.a. The ACB shall be in, but not of, the Division of City Planning. The ACB is essentially an artists' peer review committee. In order to reside in a work/live studio in the WALDO, an artist must be so certified by the Planning Board. The Planning Board shall be guided in this certification by the recommendation made by the ACB. The Planning Board may reject the recommendation of the ACB, but the reasons for such rejection must be clearly stated in the resolution approved by the Board. 
2.  The ACB shall be comprised of persons knowledgeable in the arts. It shall consist of five full members, with no more than two additional alternate members who may vote in the absence of full members. A minimum of three full members of the ACB shall be professional artists. All members shall be appointed by the Mayor. After the initial appointments are made, all terms shall run for four years. 
3.  The ACB shall review application filed by persons who are interested in occupying work/live space in the WALDO as either owners, tenants or sub-tenants, to determine if the applicant can be certified to occupy such space. 
4.  The following shall serve as criteria to be used by the ACB in certifying an artist: (a) the artists' commitment to the fine arts as a career; (b) the need for large loft space in which to create his or her art; (c) education; (d) current body of work; (e) exhibition record; (f) references from other artists or art professionals. In no event shall the content of the art created be used as a criterion to determine eligibility to occupy work/live space in the WALDO. 
5.  The recommendation of the ACB to the Planning Board shall be submitted to the Planning Board within thirty (30) days of the ACB's decision, and shall state the reasons for the decision with specific reference to one or more of the criteria set forth in subsection (A)(4) of this section. 
6.  Once an artist is certified by the Planning Board, the Planning Board shall forward a copy of its certification decision to the Zoning Officer, who shall retain the certification in the Zoning Officer's files. The certification shall expire ten (10) years after the date of the decision by the Planning Board. Renewal applications may be filed. In the event a certified artist is divorced or dies, the family of the artist occupying the work/live space shall be given a two year grace period.

B.  Complete Application. The Division of City Planning shall review all applications and accompanying documents required by the applicable checklist to determine that the application is complete. An application for development shall be complete for purposes of commencing the applicable time period for action when so certified by the Division of City Planning. In the event that the Division of City Planning does not certify the application to be complete within forty-five (45) days of the date of its submission, the application shall be deemed complete upon the expiration of the forty-five (45) day period for purposes of commencing the applicable time period unless (1) the application lacks information indicated on the checklist for such application and (2) the Division of City Planning has notified the applicant, in writing, of the deficiencies in the application within forty-five (45) days of submission of the application. The applicant may request that one or more submission requirements be waived, in which event the Department shall grant or deny the request within forty-five (45) days. Nothing herein shall be construed as diminishing the applicant's obligation to prove in the application process that he is entitled to approval of the application. The Division of City Planning may subsequently require correction of any information found to be in error and submission of additional information not specified in the checklist or any revisions in the accompanying documents, as are reasonably necessary to make an informed decision as to whether the requirements necessary for approval of the application for development have been met. The application shall not be deemed incomplete for lack of any such additional information or any revisions in the accompanying documents so required by the Division of City Planning.

1.  The zoning requirements applicable to the preliminary approval first granted and all other rights conferred upon the developer including any associated variance approval, pursuant to this Article, whether conditionally or otherwise, shall not be changed for a period of two years after the date on which the resolution of final approval is adopted; provided that in the case of major subdivision the rights conferred by this Article shall expire if the plat has not been duly recorded within the time period provided in this article.

4.  The Board shall grant an extension of final approval for a period determined by the Board but not exceeding one year from what would otherwise be the expiration date, if the developer proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board that the developer was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from proceeding with the development because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other governmental entities and that the developer applied promptly for and diligently pursued these approvals. A developer shall apply for an extension before (a) what would otherwise be the expiration date of final approval, or (b) the 91st day after the developer receives the last legally required approval from other governmental entities, whichever occurs later. An extension granted pursuant to this Article shall not preclude the Board from granting an extension pursuant to subsections (E)(1) and (2) of this section.

The Board may extend the ninety-five (95) day or one hundred ninety (190) day period if the applicant proves to the reasonable satisfaction of the Board (a) that the applicant was barred or prevented, directly or indirectly, from filing because of delays in obtaining legally required approvals from other governmental or quasi-governmental entities and (b) that the applicant applied promptly for and diligently pursued required approvals. The length of the extension shall be equal to the period of delay caused by the wait for the required approvals, as determined by the Board. The developer may apply for an extension either before or after the original expiration date. 
2.  No subdivision plat shall be accepted for filing by the County Register until it has been approved by the Board as indicated on the instrument by the signature of the Chairperson, Secretary of the Board.

ARTICLE V - Zoning and Design Standards 
 
§ 345-34. - Zoning districts. 
For the purpose of this Chapter, the City of Jersey City is hereby divided into the following zoning districts and shown on the Zoning Map: 
A.  R-1 One and Two Family Housing; 
B.  R-1A One and Two Family Housing; [Added 1-24-2007 by Ord. No. 06-163; 12-14-2011 by Ord. No. 11-149]

Q.  G Government; 
R.  P/OS Parks/Open Space; 
S.  WPD Waterfront Planned Development; 
T.  C Cemetery; 
U.  H Historic District; 
V.  DT Destination Tourism.  
§ 345-35. - Zoning map. 
The boundaries of these zoning districts are established on the map entitled "City of Jersey City Zoning Map" originally adopted by Council on April 11, 2001 by Ord. No. 01-042. This map is amended periodically. The current map is in on file and available for public inspection and/or purchase at the Division of City Planning, 30 Montgomery Street, Suite 1400, Jersey City, New Jersey. 
  
§ 345-36. - Interpretation of boundaries. 
A.  Zoning district boundary lines are intended to follow street center lines, railroad rights-of-way and lot lines as they exist on lots of record at the time of enactment of this chapter unless otherwise indicated by dimensions on the Zoning Map. Any dimensions shown shall be in feet and measured horizontally and, when measured from a street, shall be measured from the street right-of-way line even if that same street is the location of a zoning district line along its center line. The exact location of any disputed zoning district boundary line shall be determined by the Board of Adjustment. The zoning standards, controls and designations apply to every structure, lot and use within each district, and the district lines extend vertically in both directions from ground level. The district boundary lines shown to terminate at the pierhead line should be continued in a straight line out to the City limits, should these water areas require a district interpretation. 
B.  Boundaries indicated as following or approximately following shorelines shall be construed as following such shorelines but, in the event of change in the shoreline, shall be construed as moving with the actual shoreline. Boundaries indicated as following or approximately following City lines shall be construed as following such City lines. 
C.  If there is question regarding any zone boundary, the zoning map as referenced and attached hereto shall be used to determine the exact boundary line.  
§ 345-37. - Vacating a street or other public right-of-way. 
Where a vacated street or other public right-of-way is bounded on both sides by different zoning districts, the former center line of the vacated right-of-way shall be considered the zoning district boundary line.  
§ 345-38. - Redevelopment areas. 
[Amended 9-12-2012 by Ord. No. 12-112 ; 2-13-2013 by Ord. No. 13-009 ] 
A.  In any area officially declared and delineated as a redevelopment area by duly adopted ordinances, the standards and designations contained in the Redevelopment Plans for such legally adopted plans shall take precedence over any standards contained within this Chapter. The only exception to this provision shall apply to the Site Plan approval requirements of the Planning Board. All redevelopment plan approval procedures within redevelopment plans shall be revised to be consistent with the following procedure and requirements: 
1.  Prior to commencement of construction, architectural drawings and site plans with detailed specifications for the construction and/or rehabilitation of improvements to the area shall be submitted by the developer to the Planning Board of the City of Jersey City for review and approval so that compliance of such plans with the redevelopment requirements and objectives can be determined. Site plan review shall be conducted by the Planning Board pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-1 et seq. Applications may be submitted for the entire project or in any number of phases. Final Site Plan approval for any phase shall entitle an applicant to building permits. 
2.  As part of any Final Site Plan approval, the Planning Board may require a developer to furnish performance guarantees pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 et seq. Such performance guarantees shall be in favor of the City in a form approved by the Jersey City Corporation Counsel. The amount of any such performance guarantees shall be determined by the City Engineer and shall be sufficient to assure completion of on- and off-site improvements within one (1) year of final site plan approval. 
Where the standards and controls of the Plans do not provide alterations to the provisions of this chapter, those provisions of this Chapter that remain unchanged shall prevail. 
B.  Definitions as found in §345-1 shall apply to all zones and all Redevelopment Plan Areas citywide.  
§ 345-39. - Variances and waivers. 
Any deviation from a provision of this Chapter which is identified as a design standard shall require a waiver by the reviewing board from the specific design standard. Any other deviation from a standard contained in this Chapter shall require a variance from the specific standard in accordance with the Municipal Land Use Law.

c.  All side yard setback three feet or greater: The side yard starting at the front of the building shall be enclosed with a fence constructed in compliance with the design standards in 345-67.B. 
7.  Minimum Rear Yard: 
a.  The rear yard setback shall be added to the front yard setback (as determined above) to produce a total of not less than thirty-five (35) feet, provided however, that in no case shall a rear yard be less than twenty (20) feet. The mathematical formula for this calculation is as follows. 
X = required front yard setback 
Y = required rear yard setback 
X + Y = at least 35 feet 
For example: 
Front Yard 	Rear Yard 	Total 
0 	35 	35 
5 	30 	35 
10 	25 	35 
12 	23 	35 
15 or more feet 	20 	35 or more feet 
16 	20 	36 
17 	20 	37 
20 	20 	40 
Etc.

8.  Maximum Building Height: Three stories with a minimum floor to ceiling height of nine feet, a maximum floor to ceiling height of twelve (12) feet, and a maximum of five additional feet between the top of the third floor and the topmost point of any peaked roof (where a peaked roof is deemed appropriate under the design standards), provided that a minimum of two adjacent floors must be connected solely by means of a staircase internal to the unit, and provided that only one of the two internally connected floors may have a kitchen and/or a full bath. 
For the purposes of calculating the maximum allowable building height an additional twelve (12) inches is assumed between the ceiling of each story and the floor above in accordance with the chart below: 
Fl. to Ceiling ht 	Fl. to fl. ht 	Total bldg ht with flat roof 	Total ht with peaked roof 
9 ft 	10 ft 	30 ft 	35 ft 
10 ft 	11 ft 	33 ft 	38 ft 
11 ft 	12 ft 	36 ft 	41 ft 
12 ft 	13 ft 	39 ft 	44 ft 
 
In the case of varied floor to ceiling heights, the total permitted building height with a flat roof shall be the sum of the floor to ceiling heights of each floor plus twelve (12) inches per floor. The total permitted building height with a peaked roof is five (5) feet higher than with a flat roof.

§ 345-50a. - Marion Works Office/Residential District. 
[Amended 3-24-2010 by Ord. No. 10-037] 
A.  Purpose 
1.  The Marion Works Office/Residential District (MWORD) shall apply to the area depicted on the revised Zoning Map of the City of Jersey City. The area encompassed by the MWORD is an older Industrial District located at the periphery of the Journal Square community. The purpose of this district is to encourage the redevelopment, rehabilitation and conversion of older industrial structures in the area to higher intensity residential and mixed-use buildings, and the construction of new residential and mixed-use buildings on vacant and underutilized land, while incorporating much needed public open space for district residents and the surrounding community. Ancillary commercial facilities are also encouraged to serve the surrounding community. 
2.  The MWORD shall apply as an overlay district, which means that it applies as alternative zoning regulations, when and if chosen by the property owner. Property owners within the MWORD may also continue to maintain uses of the property that were permitted at the time of the adoption of this amendment. However, it is recognized that the size and configuration of the existing blocks and lots are the result of the industrial and railroad use and development of this area. Therefore, if a property owner/developer chooses to utilize the Office/Residential Overlay Zoning, then the property owner I developer shall be required to provide new and/or re-opened streets rights of way. These may include the re-opening of previously vacated streets, such as Dey Street and/or the creation of new public streets and rights-of-way to accommodate the new residential and commercial re-use of property within the MWORD. It is specifically anticipated that new street connections will be necessary from the western end of Dey Street to both Saint Paul's Avenue and Newark Avenue. The location of new streets and rights-of-way should be located so as not to destroy existing or modified structures within the district. The intent of requiring these new and/or re-opened streets is to extend the street pattern into the district in order to better integrate the district into the surrounding street grid and urban fabric of the community, and to better disperse traffic from new developments. 
3.  Because of the nature and scale of the existing industrial buildings within the MWORD, the conversion from industrial to residential and mixed-use land uses may occur in a phased fashion, wherein a portion of a building and/or property may continue to be used for uses permitted at the time of adoption of this amendment, as other portions of the building and/or property are rehabilitated and used for residential and/or mixed-use purposes; provided that all building, health, safety, fire and other applicable codes are complied with. 
B.  Permitted principal uses are as follows: 
1.  Residential dwelling units within existing structures. 
2  Work/Live Units. 
3.  High-Rise Apartments.

It is recognized that the MWORD district is located on a slope wherein the highest elevation of the district is located on the eastern side of the district and the lowest elevation is located to the western side of the district. It is also recognized that taller buildings and the Pulaski Skyway are located on the north of the district and that there is an existing low-rise residential community located just to the east of the district between Dey Street and Van Winkle Avenue. Therefore, in order to accommodate the higher intensity residential and mixed-use development envisioned for the MWORD district, while at the same time respecting the existing community to the east and the opportunities afforded by the existing topography of the district, the following height regulations shall apply. 
a.  Sub-district A: Four (4) stories. The first residential floor shall be at least one (1) foot taller than the floors above, and no floor shall be less than eight (8) feet tall as measured from floor to ceiling. 
b.  Sub-district B: Existing building height at the time of adoption of the MWORD overlay zoning shall be considered conforming. In addition, the height of the eastern most building within the former American Can Company complex and the existing industrial buildings located on Newark Avenue, may be increased by one (1) story, but not more than 15 feet, provided that the additional story is setback a minimum of 15 feet from the exterior walls of the building and are designed in conformance with paragraph G of this section "Building Design Standards for Rehabilitation of Existing Industrial Structures". New buildings shall not exceed 110 feet. 
12.  Maximum Density and Floor Area Ratio: 
Similar to height, maximum density and floor area ratio shall be regulated within each sub-district as follows: 
a.  Sub-district A: 
Max Density - 80 units per acre 
b.  Sub-district B: 
Max Density  The number of units permitted within any existing building shall be determined by dividing the gross floor area of that building, which shall include any permitted additional floor area or mezzanines, by 1,200 square feet. The maximum permitted density within newly constructed buildings shall be 125 units per acre. 
Max Floor Area Ratio  N/A for existing buildings, rather, the permitted floor area shall be the existing floor area within any existing building and any additional floor area permitted pursuant to the regulations found in the MWORD. The maximum permitted floor area ratio for newly constructed buildings shall be 4.5. Areas dedicated to parking, loading areas and mechanical rooms shall be excluded from the calculation of gross floor area. 
c.  Density Bonus for additional Open Space: 
A residential density bonus is available for new residential construction projects only, not renovation projects. A project shall qualify for the density bonus when open space is provided in excess of the minimum ten percent (10%) requirement and when these new open spaces are improved as a public park and deed restricted as publicly accessible open space. The available bonus and conditions that must exist to receive the bonus are further described in Section D.14 of this plan. 
13.  Required Publicly Accessible Open Space:

Development projects consisting of multiple phases or parcels may provide such publicly accessible open space at a later date and on another parcel or parcels within the MWORD district other than the parcel that is the subject of the development application. Projects consisting of the rehabilitation of existing buildings shall provide five percent (5%) of the net land area of any development (less any area provided for public streets, rights-of-way or easements) as publicly accessible open space. Phased and/or larger development projects shall group the proposed open spaces so as to create larger more effective and usable areas. 
14.  Specific Bonus Requirements: 
a.  Sub-district A: 
i.  A density bonus of an additional seventy (70) units per acre shall be permitted (for a total of one hundred fifty (150) units per acre) when a new construction project provides an additional five percent (5%) improved open space park (to total at least fifteen percent(15%)) of the net land area of new construction. Net land area shall be the lot area, less any area provided for public streets or rights-of-way. [Amended 2-22-2012 by Ord. No. 12-016] 
ii.  Number of stories shall be permitted to increase to six (6) levels of residential over one level of parking, but only for the portion of the building having frontage along Senate Place.

G.  Building Design Standards for Rehabilitation of Existing Industrial Structures: 
1.  General: Rehabilitation and renovation of existing industrial structures shall be done in a manner that respects the individual architectural style and character of the particular building being renovated. The Dominant features or characteristics of these buildings shall be maintained. For example, many larger industrial structures were designed as a series of bays consisting of a repetition of building units along the streetscape, broken up by recessed areas or voids intended to bring air and light to inner portions of the building. These voids shall not be filled in. 
2.  Materials: It is preferable to repair, rather than replace, materials on the facades of the buildings. However, if materials must be replaced, they must be carefully selected to match the appearance of existing materials to the greatest extent practical. 
3.  Windows: Windows are a major component of a building's appearance, therefore all windows that are visible along street facades must be treated in a manner that are consistent with the architectural character of the building. Such window openings must not be reduced or modified. Although it is recognized that replacement windows must conform to contemporary standards for energy efficiency; replacement windows must be selected to be compatible with the character of the existing windows (including muntins and mullions) and the architectural style and character of the building being renovated. 
4.  Entrances: Care must be taken in locating new entrances into the buildings to accommodate the re-use of these structures. All buildings must relate to the streetscape and orient their primary entrance to the public right-of-way. Pedestrian access points shall be located on less trafficked streets and designed in manner that relates to the adjoining street and encourages pedestrian activity along the street. Conversely, vehicular access points shall be located and designed to limit their impact on the pedestrian environment and to the appearance of the building. 
5.  Roofscape: Many older industrial buildings contained skylights, water towers and other rooftop appurtenances that add to the architectural style and character of the structure. These features shall be retained and incorporated into the design and reuse of the structure. New necessary mechanical equipment and rooftop appurtenances may be located on the roof, but shall be screened and/or incorporated into the roofscape design. 
6.  Other Design Features: Many older industrial structures contained unique features such as tall smoke stacks, which became familiar features in the landscape. These features shall be retained and incorporated into the design of the building. However, other smaller or minor buildings, or minor portions of buildings, which may have been accessory to the previous use, but are no longer appropriate to the new reuse; may be removed. 
7.  Additions/Expansions: New additions/expansions of existing structures must be done in a manner that is complimentary to the existing building's design and architecture in term of size, scale, materials, etc. However, new additions should not seek to copy the existing building, as each building is a product of its own time. Additional floors may be added to the top of existing buildings provided that such construction is not contrary to the intent of paragraph G. 5. above and is in compliance with the height requirements of paragraph D. 11. of this section. 
8.  New Construction: New buildings constructed as part of the reuse and/or redevelopment of industrial sites, either as accessory to the new reuse or as infill buildings, must be designed to compliment the architecture of the existing major buildings on the site. It is recognized that each building is a product of its own time. Therefore, the new buildings should not be copies of the architectural style of the existing buildings. 
H.  Parking Structure Design Standards 
1.  Along all street rights-of-way within sub-district B, any all parking levels shall be screened by an intervening use (i.e. residential, office, retail, lobby, etc.) between the parking and the building façade. Parking levels below grade shall be exempt from this requirement. In addition, parking levels fronting onto Saint Paul's Avenue west of Van Wagenen Avenue shall also be exempt from this requirement. The design of parking levels within sub-district A shall adhere to the requirements of paragraph 2. below. 
2.  The façades of all parking structures or levels within buildings that are not screened by an intervening use shall be architecturally screened so as to not give the apparent perception of garage space from the exterior. The façade of the parking structure shall be designed to disguise the parking use to the greatest degree possible. The exterior wall of the parking structure shall be architecturally designed to mimic and reflect the occupied portions of the building in terms of style and materials. All openings in the parking structure facade shall be of the punched style. These openings shall be consistent with the rhythm of the window openings serving the principal uses within the building. They shall be covered by glass or metal in such a way that the exterior design is compatible with the design of the building and the actual windows of the building. The glass tint and/or reflectivity may be different so as to decrease the visibility of the garage use within. In lieu of glass, the openings may be covered by a hinged solid metal plate/shutter, or recessed decorative grill over a louvered opening as described below. Blind windows, where appropriate shall also be permitted. Where louvers are needed or proposed, decorative grills shall be installed over functional louvers, or other comparable decorative material shall be used in openings or portions of the openings resembling the windows provided above and/or below parking levels. The intent of the above regulations is that no exposed garage exterior wall shall be detectable as a garage. 
3.  The design of parking structures and levels shall be consistent with paragraph G of this section "Building Design Standards for Rehabilitation of Existing Industrial Structures". 
4.  Garage doors shall be provided at the ingress and egress to the parking garage and shall be designed to reflect the architecture of the building. Open metal grates and similar type doors are prohibited. Garage doors shall be kept to the minimum height and width possible so as to limit their visual impact on the streetscape and the façade of the building. 
I.  Signage: The signage regulations as found in section 345-68 of this ordinance, and as applied to the O/R District shall apply to the MWORD district. In addition, the following signage may be permitted by the Planning Board after site plan review and approval. 
1.  A roof sign or wall sign on an existing building that has been or is being renovated for a mixed use development, indicating the name of the mixed-use development; provided that it can be evidenced by photographs or other historical documentation that a similar sign previously existed on the building. Such signage must conform to the size, shape, lettering style and design of the historically documented sign. 
2.  Signs that were historically used on certain mechanical elements or architectural features of a building or complex, such as watertowers, smokestacks and chimneys, provided that said signage is not used to advertise businesses or services outside the building or complex (i.e. no outdoor advertising signs).

a.  To encourage the location of antennas upon, or within, existing structures, including existing buildings, existing wireless communication towers, existing water towers, and existing telephone and electric towers, especially those existing structures situated in non-residential districts; 
b.  To encourage the configuration of telecommunication facilities in a manner that minimizes and mitigates any adverse impacts upon affected properties, streetscapes, and vistas through careful design, siting, screening, landscaping, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
c.  To encourage the colocation of as many antennas as possible, of as many wireless telecommunication carriers as possible, on existing towers and other structures in industrial districts; 
d.  To discourage the construction of new towers which do not have the likelihood of being used by a number of wireless telecommunication carriers; 
e.  To minimize the total number of wireless telecommunications towers within the City of Jersey City; 
f.  To discourage adverse impacts on scenic corridors and historic sites and districts; 
g.  To enhance the ability of the carriers of wireless communications services who adhere to the specific requirements and intent of these ordinance provisions to provide such services quickly, effectively, and efficiently; and 
h.  To comply with the mandate of the Federal Telecommunications Act of 1996, 47 U.S.C. Section 332 (c)(7), which preserves local government authority to enforce zoning requirements which protect public safety, public and private property, and community aesthetics.

c.  Minimum Building Separation. 
i.  No setback from any lot line shall be required for existing structures that are not to be enlarged. However, in the event that a separation of structures exists, or is proposed in the event of new construction, the minimum distance between any rear wall of a building proposed for a ROZ restaurant use and any rear wall of an adjacent building containing any residential uses shall be fifteen (15) feet, as measured from building face to building face, except in the case of corner lots, where no minimum or maximum separation shall apply. 
U.  Satellite Earth Stations. 
1.  A satellite earth station shall be permitted as an accessory use in all zone districts. Satellite earth stations shall require site plan approval from the Planning Board, except where accessory to a one- or two-family residential use. 
2.  Performance Standards. 
a.  No satellite earth station may be placed in the front yard of any lot in the City. A corner lot shall be deemed to have a front yard facing each street. 
b.  Receive-only satellite earth stations thirty-six (36) inches in diameter or less shall be located on the roof. Receive-only satellite earth stations greater than thirty-six (36) inches in diameter shall be placed on a lot only in the rear yard; provided, however, that on a clear and convincing showing by an applicant that a reasonably satisfactory signal cannot be obtained from a rear yard location, the Board may permit the antenna to be located in the side yard, and if such signal cannot be obtained in either rear or side yard, the Board may permit the antenna to be located on the roof of any principal or accessory building on the lot. 
c.  A transmit/receive satellite earth station shall be placed on the roof of the principal building of the lot; provided, however, that on a clear and convincing showing by an applicant that this requirement is impracticable or would cause undue hardship, the Planning Board may permit the antenna to be located in the rear yard of the lot. If a ground-mounted transmit/receive-type antenna is proposed, the site plan shall include the proposed location of a protective fence, a minimum of four feet in height, surrounding the antenna on all sides. The proposed fence shall be constructed in accordance with the fence provisions of this Chapter. 
d.  All satellite earth stations shall not be closer to the side property line than a distance equal to the diameter of said antenna or side yard setback requirement for the principal structure on the lot, whichever results in the greatest setback. 
e.  All satellite earth stations shall not be closer to the rear property line than a distance equal to the diameter of said antenna or rear yard setback requirement for the principal structure on the lot, whichever results in the greatest setback. 
f.  When mounted on the ground, the overall height from the surrounding ground level to the lowest point of the antenna shall not exceed two feet, except in instances where additional clearance is needed to satisfactorily receive and/or transmit signals. No ground-mounted satellite earth station shall exceed twelve (12) feet in height, as measured from the average grade of the base of the antenna to the highest point of the antenna. 
g.  Roof-Mounted Antennas. 
i.  Flat roofs and mansard-style roofs. No roof-mounted satellite earth station may extend above the roofline more than nine feet six inches when mounted on a flat roof or mansard-style roof. However, upon a showing that such a roof-mounted antenna will not receive adequate reception under the restrictions of this subsection, the minimum height necessary for reasonable satisfactory reception my be allowed. Roof-mounted antennas on a flat roof shall be located in the center of the roof structure to reduce visibility. 
ii.  All other style roofs. No roof-mounted satellite earth stations may extend above the highest point of the roof more than three feet when mounted on all other style roofs, and the roof-mounted satellite earth station must be located on the portion of the roof facing the rear yard or, if this would unreasonable limit signal reception, the side yard. However, upon a showing that such a roof-mounted antenna will not receive adequate reception under the restrictions of this subsection, the minimum height necessary for reasonably satisfactory reception may be allowed. 
h.  All satellite earth stations shall be of the mesh type only, with not more than eighty-five percent (85%) of the surface being solid. 
i.  All satellite earth stations shall be painted a solid, dark, nonmetallic, non-glossy color if ground mounted. Roof-mounted antennas mounted on a flat roof or mansard-style roof shall be painted a solid, dark, nonmetallic, nonglossy light to medium gray. When mounted on all other style roofs, the satellite antenna shall be painted the color of the surface to which it is attached. 
j.  The ability of the applicant to install a satellite earth station in an unobtrusive location and to minimize the visual and health impacts on neighboring properties shall be a major factor in determining whether or not a permit is issued. 
k.  The number of allowable satellite earth stations is as follows: 
i.  For single-family and two-family dwellings, one per building. 
ii.  For attached dwellings, patio homes and duplex, townhouse and multifamily dwellings, one per building. 
iii.  For all other uses permitted in residential zones not specifically provided for otherwise (e.g., schools, churches, nursing, homes, etc.), one per building. 
l.  The satellite earth station may only be used for occupants of the building located on the property. 
m.  When the use of a satellite earth station is abandoned it shall be removed. 
n.  Satellite earth stations may not be mounted on a portable or movable structure, such as a trailer. 
o.  To the extent permitted by law, no satellite earth station shall be located on or abutting any property which is located in the National of State Register or Historic Places. 
p.  No satellite earth station shall be erected on a public utility easement without the consent of the easement holder. 
q.  The proposed earth satellite station shall be the smallest commercially available equipment based on the current technology so as to minimize the visual impact on the surrounding areas. 
r.  The satellite earth station may not be used as a sign. 
s.  All wiring or connecting cables between the satellite earth station and the principal building on the site shall be buried underground. 
t.  Screening. Ground-mounted antennas shall be screened as to minimize visibility from public streets and adjoining properties. Screening shall be accompanied by the installation of landscaping and/or fencing or in the form of a wall or structure enclosing the antenna. The species, quantity, size and spacing of plant materials shall be specified on the site plan. In order to reduce the height of plant materials, soil berms may be used in conjunction with the proposed landscaping. Any walls or structure shall be constructed of plastic, fiberglass, or other approved materials which will not impede the function and operation of the antenna. Any walls or structures shall be constructed to be consistent with the surrounding site characteristics. The requirements of this subsection shall not impose unreasonable limitations on, or prevent, reception of satellite-delivered signals by satellite and receiving/transmitting antennas or impose costs on the users of such antennas that are excessive in light of the purchase and installation cost of the equipment. 
3.  Such satellite earth stations, appurtenances, landscaping and fencing shall be kept and maintained in good condition.

If in the opinion of a majority of the above three people the damage or condition warranting condemnation is greater than fifty percent (50%) of the value of replacing the entire structure, the structure or use shall be considered completely destroyed and may be rebuilt to the original non-conforming structure or use specifications only upon approval of a use variance as provided by state statute. 
b.  In the event of a condemned structure, or where the damage is less than fifty percent (50%) of the value of replacing the entire structure in the opinion of the majority of the above three people, the non-conforming structure or use rebuilt and the property used for the same non conforming structure or use, provided that it does not exceed any height, area and volume of the original structure, the site plan application shall be filed within ninety (90) days of the receipt of written notice of the determination of damage by the above three people and the reconstruction shall commence within one year and ninety (90) days from the date the building was damaged or condemned and the reconstruction shall be carried on without interruption. 
c.  In the event of a condemned structure, or where the damage is less than fifty percent (50%) of the value of replacing the entire structure in the opinion of the majority of the above three people, the non-conforming structure or use may be rebuilt and the property used for the same non-conforming structure or use, provided that it does not exceed any height, area and volume of the original structure, the site plan application shall be filed within ninety (90) days of the receipt of written notice of the determination of damage by the above three people, and the reconstruction shall commence within one year and ninety (90) days from the date the building was damaged or condemned and the reconstruction shall be carried on without interruption. 
d.  The total value of the structure shall be based on the current cost of replacing those portions damaged or condemned to their original status plus the current cost of replacing the remaining usable elements of the structure.

A.  Exempt Signs. [Amended 1-29-2014 by Ord. No. 14-006 ] 
1.  Any public notice or warning required by a valid and applicable federal, state, county or local law, regulation or ordinance. 
2.  Any sign which is inside a building, not attached to a window or door, and is not readable from a distance of more than three (3) feet beyond the lot line of the lot or parcel nearest to where such sign is located. 
3.  Holiday lights and decorations with no commercial message. 
4.  Any sign describing the history of the building with tablets, cornerstones or similar, plaques embedded on the façade below four (4) feet. 
5.  Traffic control signs on private property, which meet Department of Transportation standards, and which contain no commercial message of any sort. 
6.  Flags of the United States, New Jersey, the City of Jersey City and flags of foreign nations. 
7.  Signs or banners advertising public or quasi-public events that are posted with the permission of the City Council or of any person to whom the City Council has delegated this authority according to guidelines set by City Council. 
8.  Pump mounted fuel price information signs subject to the following: 
a.  Only one (1) fuel price informational sign shall be permitted per fuel pump. 
b.  Fuel price informational signs shall be limited in size to an area of two hundred sixteen (216) square inches in accordance with State and Federal regulations. 
c.  Each fuel price informational sign shall be affixed directly and firmly to a fuel pump and shall be stationary. 
d.  Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit the advertisement of fuel prices on any other sign meeting the requirements of this section. 
9.  U.S. Postal Regulation Mailboxes. 
10.  Political Signs. Such signs may be displayed for a period of not more than thirty (30) days before the election and not more than three (3) days after the election. 
B.  Zoning Standards. [Amended 5-8-2013 by Ord. No. 13-053 ; 1-29-2014 by Ord. No. 14-006 ] 
1.  Individual Sign Area Measurement. 
a.  The area of a sign face (which is also the sign area of a wall sign or other sign with only one (1) face) shall be computed by means of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or combination thereof that will encompass the extreme limits of the writing, graphic, illustration, picture, symbol or other display, together with any material or color forming an integral part of the background of the sign. For purposes of calculating sign area, any illuminated border including those which may frame a window shall be included in the sign area calculation and used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. This does not include any supporting framework, bracing or decorative fence or wall when such fence or wall otherwise meets zoning regulations and is clearly incidental to the sign itself. 
b.  No sign shall have more than two (2) display faces. The sign area for a sign with two (2) display faces shall be computed by adding together the area of all the sign's faces which are visible from any one (1) point. When a sign has two (2) display faces such that both faces cannot be viewed from any one (1) point at the same time, the sign's area shall be computed by the measurement of the larger of the two (2) faces. 
2.  In cases where sign standards are not established, standards from the most similar zone and use shall apply. 
3.  Glazed Area. Any glazing in doorways shall be considered part of the glazed area. For purposes of calculating window signs, a window shall be considered the glazed area. Signs which are required by county, state, or federal agencies are exempt from calculation of permanent signage. 
4.  Measurement of Height. The height of a freestanding sign shall be computed as the distance from the base of the sign at normal grade to the top of the highest attached component of the sign. Normal grade shall be considered to be the lower of existing grade prior to construction or the newly established grade after construction, exclusive or any filing, berming, mounding or excavation solely. 
5.  The following signs are prohibited: 
a.  No billboards or other off-site advertising signs shall be erected, used or maintained within the City of Jersey City except in the CBD Central Business District. 
b.  No signs shall be placed on fences, walls, utility poles, trees, railway or road bridges, bridge supports or abutments, retaining walls, parking meters or water towers unless approved by the City Council. 
c.  No roof signs, also known as "sky signs" shall be allowed except in the CBD. 
d.  No signs above the second floor of any building other than hotels. 
e.  No sign shall be placed on an accessory building. 
f.  No sign shall be lighted by means of a varied illuminated light, nor shall any sign be in whole or in any part moving, mobile, revolving and/or electrically or mechanically activated except in the CBD Central Business District. Signs displaying the time and/or temperature shall be permitted in non residential districts. 
g.  No sign shall be allowed with the optical illusion of movement by means of a design which presents a pattern capable of reverse perspective, giving the illusion of motion or changing copy except in the CBD. 
h.  No signs shall be allowed that are placed on or affixed to vehicles and/or trailers which are parked on a public right-of-way, public property or private property so as to be visible from a public right-of-way where the apparent purpose is to advertise a product, service or activity or direct people to a business or activity. This is not intended, however, to prohibit signs placed on or affixed to vehicles, buses or trailers where the sign is incidental to the primary use of the vehicle or trailer. 
i.  No sign shall be allowed to obstruct any window or door opening used as a means of egress, interferes with an opening required for legal ventilation, or is attached to or obstructs any standpipe, fire escape or fire hydrant. 
j.  No sign shall be allowed which obstructs the view of vehicle operators or pedestrians entering a public roadway from any parking area, service drive, public driveway, alley or other thoroughfare. 
k.  No building sign shall be greater than four (4) feet from the building face. 
6.  The following signs and the standards and conditions that govern such signs are set forth in the sign matrix. All other signs are expressly prohibited. 
C.  Design Standards. 
1.  Signs shall be in harmony and consistent with the architecture of the building and relate to the features of the building in terms of location, scale, color, lettering, materials, texture and depth. Signs shall not be dominant but shall be proportionate and shall complement the building, existing signs and surroundings. 
2.  There shall be consistent sign design throughout a particular project. The design elements include style of lettering, construction materials, size and illumination. 
3.  Building signs shall not obscure, conflict with or cover any architectural element and must be aligned with major building elements such as windows, trim and structure lines. 
4.  No sign shall extend or project above the highest elevation of the wall to which it is attached or above the lowest part of the roofline of the building, whichever is less. 
5.  Illuminated signs. 
a.  Internally illuminated signs shall only be permitted in the HC, and C/A zones. 
b.  Signs lit by external sources shall be allowed but shall be located in such a manner so as to avoid any glare on adjacent property. Sources of sign illumination shall be completely shielded from the view of vehicular traffic using the road or roads abutting the lot on which the sign is located. 
c.  External lights used for the illumination of any sign on a mounted building, whether or not such light fixtures are attached to or separate from the building, shall not extend above the highest elevation of the front wall of the building or more than eighteen (18) feet above the street level of the premises, whichever is less. 
6.  Signs and sign structures of all types shall be located to allow a clear, unobstructed line of sight for three hundred (300) feet from the stop line of any intersection of streets and/or driveways. No sign shall project into a sight triangle below the second story floor level or the height of a traffic signal or traffic directional sign in the intersection, whichever is higher. 
D.  Nonconforming Signs. 
1.  No nonconforming sign may be enlarged or altered in a way which would increase its nonconformity. Existing nonconforming permanent signs may continue to exist; however, when the sign is modified either in shape, size, illumination or structure, the sign shall be altered to conform to the provisions of this section. 
2.  Should any nonconforming sign be damaged by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost at time of damage, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this section.

4.  Stilted buildings are prohibited. 
5.  All off-street parking lots, except those of one and two-family residences, shall be provided with curbing of poured-in-place concrete, so that vehicles cannot be driven onto required landscaped areas, buffer zones, interior roadways, internal walkways and street rights-of-way so that each parking lot has controlled entrances and exits and proper drainage control. Curbing of poured-in-place concrete shall be located to prevent any part of the vehicle from overhanging the street right-of-way, property line, interior roadways or internal walkways.

§ 345-71. - Historic design standards. 
A.  General standards below are considered inclusive and shall be considered in conjunction with the applicable provisions of any subsection of this section. 
1.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of the building structure or site and its environment or to use a property for its originally intended purpose. 
2.  The distinguishing original qualities or character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible. 
3.  All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations which have no historical basis and which seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged. 
4.  Changes, which may have taken place in the course of time, are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right, and this significance shall be recognized and respected. 
5.  Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship which characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity. 
6.  Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced wherever possible. In the event that replacement is necessary, the new material shall match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features shall be based on accurate duplications of features substantiated by historical, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural design or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures. 
7.  The surface cleaning shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken. 
8.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by or adjacent to any acquisition, protection, stabilization, preservation, rehabilitation, restoration or reconstruction project. 
9.  When the replacements are made, exterior architectural elements, such as but not limited to windows, doors, and siding, shall be replaced with a style and finish of the period of significance of the building. Use of original materials is preferred. 
B.  Standards for Protection. 
1.  Before applying protective measures, which are generally of a temporary nature and imply future historic preservation work, an analysis of the actual or anticipated threats to the property shall be made. 
2.  Protection shall safeguard the physical condition or environment of a property or archaeological site from further deterioration or damage caused by weather or other natural, animal or human intrusions. 
3.  If any historic material or architectural features are removed, they shall be properly recorded and, if possible, stored for future study or reuse. 
C.  Standards for Stabilization. 
1.  Stabilization shall reestablish the structural stability of a property through the reinforcement of load-bearing members or by arresting material deterioration leading to structural failure. Stabilization shall also reestablish weather resistant conditions for a property. 
2.  Stabilization shall be accomplished in such a manner that it detracts as little as possible from the property's appearance. When reinforcement is required to reestablish structural stability, such work shall be concealed wherever possible so as not to intrude upon or detract from the aesthetic and historical quality of the property, except where concealment would result in the alteration or destruction of historically significant material or spaces. 
D.  Standards for Preservation. 
1.  Preservation shall maintain the existing form, integrity and materials of a building, structure or site. Substantial reconstruction or restoration of lost features generally are not included in a preservation undertaking. 
2.  Preservation shall include techniques of arresting or retarding the deterioration of a property through a program of ongoing maintenance. 
E.  Standards for Rehabilitation. 
1.  Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historic, architectural or cultural material and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property, neighborhood or environment. 
2.  Wherever possible, new additions or alterations to structures shall be done in such a manner that if such additions or alterations were to be removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the structure would be unimpaired. 
F.  Standards for Restoration. 
1.  Every reasonable effort shall be made to use a property for its originally intended purpose or to provide a compatible use that will require minimum alteration to the property and its environment. 
2.  Reinforcement required for structural stability or the installation of protective or code-required mechanical systems shall be concealed whenever possible so as not to intrude or detract from the property's aesthetic and historical qualities, except where concealment would result in the alteration or destruction of historically significant materials or spaces. 
3.  When archeological resources must be disturbed by restoration work, recovery of archeological material shall be undertaken in conformance with current professional practices. 
G.  Standards for Reconstruction. 
1.  Reconstruction of a part or all of a property shall be undertaken only when such work is essential to reproduce a significant missing feature in a historic district or site, and when a contemporary design solution is not acceptable. 
2.  Reconstruction of all or part of a historic property shall be appropriate when the reconstruction is essential for understanding and interpreting the value of a historic district or when no other building, structure, object or landscape feature with the same associative value has survived and sufficient historical documentation exists to ensure an accurate reproduction of the original. 
3.  The reproduction of missing elements accomplished with new materials shall duplicate the composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities of the missing element. Reconstruction of missing architectural features shall be based upon accurate duplication of original features, substantiated by historical, physical or pictorial evidence rather than upon conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural features from other buildings. 
4.  Reconstruction of a building or structure on an original site shall be preceded by a thorough archaeological investigation to locate and identify all subsurface features and artifacts. 
5.  Reconstruction shall include measures to preserve any remaining original fabric, including foundations, subsurface and ancillary elements. The reconstruction of missing elements and features shall be done in such a manner that the essential form and integrity of the original surviving features are unimpaired. 
H.  Standards for New Construction. 
1.  In considering whether to approve or disapprove an application for a permit for new construction in an historic district, the Commission shall be guided by standards of the Secretary of the Interior and the following compatibility standards. 
2.  New construction need not replicate historic older buildings or structures, but may reflect contemporary design standards so long as the design and construction is compatible with surrounding historic structures. Building height, width, mass and proportion affect the degree of compatibility between the old and the new. 
a.  Site and Setting. A developer intending to utilize a historic resource as a part of a development must consider the context of the resource's original site by honoring the original historic intention of said resource and integrating it respectfully into the new development. Design elements shall have compatible rhythm and repetition with an emphasis on historically compatible materials and colors. 
b.  Building Height. Height shall be visually compatible with adjacent buildings. The apparent physical size, scale and height shall relate to existing resources. 
c.  Openings on Frontal Facades. The width and height of windows, doors and entries must harmonize in scale and proportion with the width and height of windows, doors and entries of buildings and structures of historic significance in the surrounding environment. 
d.  Relationship of Unbroken Planes to Voids (i.e., punctured planes) in Front Facades. The relationship of unbroken planes (i.e., walls) to voids (i.e., windows and doors) on the façade of a building or structure shall be aesthetically harmonious with that of buildings and structures of historic significance in the surrounding environment. 
e.  Relationship of Vacant Land to Buildings/Structures. The relationship of a building or structure to the vacant land between an adjacent building or structure shall not violate the existing paradigmatic spatial relationship of historically significant structures to the vacant land between said structures and adjoining buildings. The building mass in large architectural projects can be varied in form by using setbacks to create open spaces and landscaping when desirable to provide harmonious visual transitions between new construction and the adjacent historic properties. 
f.  Relationship of Exterior Projections to the Street. The relationship of exterior projections to the street in new construction shall be aesthetically harmonious with the relationship of exterior projections to the street in the surrounding existing buildings of historic significance. 
g.  Relationship of Major Exterior Building Materials. The major exterior building materials on the façade of a building or on a structure shall reflect the predominant major building materials existent on the facades of historically significant buildings and on structures in the surrounding environment. 
h.  Roof Forms. The roof form and slope of a building or structure is a major element in the visual image of the building. Therefore, designers must take care to honor paradigmatically in new construction the existing historic roof forms and slopes so as not to violate the aesthetic harmony of the whole. 
i.  Continuity in Visual Imagery of Appurtenances. Appurtenances of a building or structure such as walls, fences and landscaping shall honor the relationship of appurtenances to buildings of historic significance in the surrounding environment. 
j.  Scale of Buildings. The scale of buildings and structures shall be in scale with the buildings and structures of historic significance. 
k.  Signage. Signs which are out of keeping with the character of the environment in question shall not be used. Excessive size and inappropriate placement on buildings results in visual clutter and shall be designed to relate harmoniously to exterior building materials and colors. A good sign shall express a simple clear message with wording kept to a minimum. 
1.  Site Planning. The site planning of landscaping, parking facilities, utility and service areas, walkways and appurtenances must reflect the site planning of landscaping, parking facilities, utility and service areas, walkways and landscape features reticulate to buildings or structures of historic significance. 
m.  Accessory Garage Design. All garage facades shall be in character with the immediate surrounding historic properties and must be compatible with the significant historic features and characteristics of the facades and streetscape of the immediate block front on which the proposed structure is located as well as the block front directly across the street. 
n.  Off-Street Parking. All required off-street parking shall be enclosed, and the enclosure shall be in character with the design of the immediate surrounding historic structures as outlined in this chapter. Such parking shall be designed so as to be at least fifty percent (50%) below grade and covered and shall be located entirely under the building where feasible, but, if located within the rear yard area, at least fifty percent (50%) of the entire yard area, including the garage rooftop area, shall consist of landscaping which may be a combination of grass, groundcover and shrubs, and the remaining area shall be covered with decorative brick or concrete payers, or comparable, durable materials. 
I.  Relocation of a Landmark or Building, Object or Structure Located in a Historic District. In considering whether to recommend, approve or disapprove an application for a permit to relocate a building, object or structure designated a historic landmark or located in a historic district, the Commission shall be guided by the following considerations: 
1.  The historic character and aesthetic interest the building, structure or object contributes to its present setting. 
2.  Whether there are definite plans for the area to be vacated and what the effect of those plans on the character of the surrounding area will be. 
3.  Whether the building, structure or object can be moved without significant damage to its physical integrity. 
4.  Whether the proposed relocation area is compatible with the historical and architectural character of the building, object or structure. 
J.  Demolition. 
1.  The following shall be considered in regard to an application to demolish an individual landmark building, structure, site or object or any building, structure, site or object contained within a historic district [Amended 9-15-2010 by Ord. No. 10-106] : 
a.  Its historic, architectural and aesthetic significance. 
b.  Its use. 
c.  Its importance to the city and the extent to which its historic or architectural value is such that its removal would be detrimental to the public interest. 
d.  The extent to which it is of such old, unusual or uncommon design, craftsmanship, texture or material that it could not be reproduced or could be reproduced only with great difficulty. 
e.  The probable impact of its removal upon the ambience of the historic district. 
f.  The structural soundness and integrity of the building so as to comply with the requirements of the state uniform code. 
g.  The effect on the remaining portion of the building, structure, site, object or landscape feature in cases of partial demolition. 
2.  In the event that the structure is unsafe or unsound so as to impose a danger to health or safety, the power and authority of the City of Jersey City to demolish the structure, as otherwise provided by law, shall not be impaired or altered in any way by the provisions of this chapter. The city shall be exempt from making an application to the Commission but shall notify the Commission prior to the demolition. 
3.  If an application to demolish is denied, the applicant shall follow the appeal process detailed herein for denial of certificates of appropriateness. 
K.  Other Guidelines. The commission shall utilize locally generated guidelines or historic preservation aids in addition to the Secretary of Interior's Standards. 
L.  Additional Regulations for Alterations and Additions to Buildings and New Construction. 
 
1.  Windows. 
a.  Repair. Deteriorated windows can often be repaired and made sound and fully operational. A Certificate of No Effect is required to undertake ordinary repairs including: 
i.  Replacing or rebuilding any parts of a window such as the sill and portions of the sash and frames using the same material and with the same configuration, shape and dimension. 
ii.  Scraping, priming and repainting of window sash and/or frame. 
iii.  Consolidating wood members with cellulose wood fillers or chemical materials. Change in shape, size or configuration require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
b.  Replacement. 
i.  If historic windows have deteriorated to a point precluding repair, rehabilitation or restoration, based on documentation submitted by the applicant, or a field inspection by the Historic Preservation Officer, replacement windows may be approved under a Certificate of No Effect if they match the historic windows in terms of configuration, operation, details, material and finish. Variations in details will be permitted if such variations do not significantly affect the visual characteristics of the historic window, including the shadow effect of muntins and sash on the glazing. In evaluating "significant" effect, other factors to be considered shall be the age of the building and its architectural quality, as well as the extent of reduction in the total glazed area of the proposed sash compared to the existing sash. For narrow wood windows (less than fifteen (15) inches wide), the reduction shall be limited to ten percent (10%); for wood windows, fifteen (15) inches or wider, the reduction shall be limited to six percent; for metal double-hung windows (of any size), the reduction shall be limited to ten percent (10%). 
ii.  In buildings less than thirty (30) years old, the replacement windows need not match the historic window in terms of materials. The finish, however, must match the finish of the original windows. On secondary facades, windows which are visible from a public thoroughfare need only match the historic windows in terms of configuration and finish. 
iii.  Proposals for replacement windows which do not meet these conditions will require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
c.  Storm Windows. The installation of exterior storm windows will be granted a Certificate of No Effect providing they meet the following conditions: 
 
i.  Exterior storm windows shall fit tightly within window openings without the need for a subframe or panning around the perimeter. 
ii.  The color of the frames of the storm windows shall match the color of the primary window frame. 
iii.  Glazing shall be clear. 
iv.  The storm sash shall be set as far back from the plane of the exterior wall surface as is practicable. 
v.  Muntins shall not be permitted. 
vi.  Meeting rails may be used only in conjunction with double-hung windows and shall be placed in the same relative location as in the primary sash. 
d.  Supporting Documentation. Applications for replacement windows must include photographs and dimensioned drawings of the existing condition of the windows. In addition, manufacturer's catalogue cuts or full or half-scale drawings of the proposed windows with comparative dimensions, details of construction and configuration and color and finish samples are required. Proposals for a change in material shall include a material sample. 
2.  Storefronts. 
 
a.  Repair. 
i.  Every effort should be made to retain and repair historic storefronts as well as significant surviving fragments of historic storefronts. While a non-original historic storefront may differ in style from the original building, it reflects the shifts in popular taste and documents the changes over time within an historic district and should be treated with sensitivity. 
ii.  A Certificate of No Effect is required for ordinary repairs to existing storefronts, both historic and non-historic. This would include replacing deteriorated, damaged or missing features with matching components and painting or refinishing. 
iii.  Changes in design or configuration of an historic storefront requires a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
b.  Replacement. 
i.  If replacement of a storefront is necessary, the design of the new storefront should reproduce the historic storefront in terms of its configuration, materials, placement, proportions and extent of glazed area. The design of the replacement store front may be based on surviving historic storefronts elsewhere on the building or another identical building, or on documentary evidence such as original architectural drawings or old photographs. 
ii.  In cases where the historic storefront has been replaced and there is no extant historic storefront elsewhere on the building, nor on another identical building, and no documentary evidence can be found, a contemporary design is permissible and should meet the following criteria: 
(A)  It fits entirely within the existing storefront opening(s); 
(B)  It incorporates any architecturally and/or historically significant surviving fragments of an historic storefront; 
(C)  It is compatible with the original materials and colors of the upper floors; and 
(D)  It includes traditional storefront elements (i.e. transoms, glass display windows, low bulkheads, recessed entrance, signband) which are appropriate to the age and style of the building. 
iii.  All applications for new storefronts require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
c.  Signage. In accordance with other provisions in this chapter (See 345-68 and 345-71.M). 
[Amended 5-28-2008 by Ord. No. 08-072] 
d.  Awnings. Awnings are permitted on storefronts and should meet the following conditions: The awning is a retractable type with a sloped profile (exception may be made for buildings less than thirty (30) years old and non-historic storefronts); 
i.  The metal frame is covered with canvas fabric in an historically appropriate color and pattern to the building and the historic district; 
ii.  Lettering on the awning is limited to the skirt; however, logos may be printed on the sloped portion of the awning; 
iii.  The awning frame is attached to the building in such a way that it does not destroy or cause irreversible damage to significant architectural features; 
iv.  The awning fits within the storefront opening and has the same shape as the opening. 
e.  Security Gates. 
i.  Security gates should be installed in the interior of all storefronts and should be of the open-link variety. If new storefronts are to be installed, or in cases where the historic storefront had external security gates, the gate tracks should be recessed into the glazing reveal and the gate housing should be flush with the plane of the storefront, and should be contained within a plenum space above the storefront or behind a transom panel or signage panel. The gate housing, tracks or mechanical boxes should not protrude from the plane of the storefront or be apparent. Exterior scissor-type gates are also acceptable. 
ii.  Applications for open link interior security gates require a Certificate of No Effect. Applications for all other security gates require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
f.  Supporting Documentation. Applications for replacement storefronts must include photographs of the existing storefront, to scale drawings of the proposed storefront, signage, awning and/or security gates (elevation, sections and full or half-scale details), and materials and color samples. 
3.  Additions. 
a.  Rear Yard Additions. 
i.  A Certificate of No Effect will be granted for applications for rear yard additions which meet the following criteria: 
(A)  The proposed addition is not visible from a public thoroughfare or right-of-way. 
(B)  The addition will not extend to the rear lot line, nor substantially eliminate the presence of a rear yard. 
(C)  Other rear yard incursions exist within the block. 
(D)  The proposed work complies with the Historic Zoning District regulations and will not require a variance. 
(E)  The rear addition does not rise to the full height of the building. 
(F)  The existing rear façade will not be removed from the entire width of the building. Instead, existing openings will be modified to provide access into the addition. (This approach retains original building fabric and reduces structural intervention.) 
ii.  Applications for rear yard additions which do not meet the criteria will most likely require a Certificate of Appropriateness. For proposed additions which will be visible from a public thoroughfare or right-of-way, the Commission will consider the effect of the addition on any significant architectural features on the building's rear façade, and the scale and architectural character of the addition's façade in relation to the building's front façade. 
b.  Rooftop Additions. A Certificate of No Effect will be granted for applications for rooftop additions which meet the following criteria: 
 
i.  The addition consists of mechanical equipment, egress or mechanical bulkheads or utilitarian skylights only; or the addition consists of living space and complies with the Historic Zoning regulations. 
ii.  The roof of the subject building is not a significant feature of its design. 
iii.  The addition is not visible from a public thoroughfare or right-of-way. 
iv.  If the building possesses a significant roof silhouette, the addition does not interrupt the roof or skyline. 
v.  The materials of the addition are in the nature of utilitarian rooftop accretions and are in keeping with the existing roofscape. 
vi.  The addition does not adversely affect the significant ensemble of buildings by creating a distracting element in an otherwise uniform roofscape. 
vi.  The addition does not adversely affect the significant ensemble of buildings by creating a distracting element in an otherwise uniform roofscape. 
vii.  Applications for rooftop additions which do not meet the above criteria will most likely require a Certificate of Appropriateness. 
c.  Supporting Documentation. Applications for rear yard or rooftop additions must include photographs of the existing buildings (including rear facade for rear additions), individually and in the context of the neighborhood, to-scale floor plans, elevations and sections of the building and addition, to-scale sight line drawings for rooftop additions, a site plan of the entire block for rear yard additions, full or half scale details of windows, doors and decorative trim, materials and color samples. 
[Amended 11-10-2010 by Ord. No. 10-129] 
4.  Restoration. 
 
a.  A Certificate of No Effect will be granted for applications for the restoration of a building or building façade features (such as stoops, cornices, window and door openings and enframements) to their historic appearance when the following criteria are met: 
i.  The restoration would not cause the removal of non-original historic building fabric (i.e., Victorian Period features on an early 19th Century structure). 
ii.  The restoration is based on documentation such as: 
(A)  Physical evidence on the building; 
(B)  Original drawings; 
(C)  Old photographs; 
(D)  An identical building.

§ 3. - General Standards. 
A.  Design and Performance Standards for Stormwater Management Measures 
1.  Stormwater management measures for major development shall be developed to meet the erosion control, groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality standards in Section 4. To the maximum extent practicable, these standards shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies into the design. If these strategies alone are not sufficient to meet these standards, structural stormwater management measures necessary to meet these standards shall be incorporated into the design. 
2.  The standards in this ordinance apply only to new major development and are intended to minimize the impact of stormwater runoff on water quality and water quantity in receiving water bodies and maintain groundwater recharge. The standards do not apply to new major development in areas with a separate sewer system that is neither directly nor indirectly connected to a combined sewer system to the extent that alternative design and performance standards are applicable under a regional stormwater management plan or Water Quality Management Plan adopted in accordance with Department rules. Alternative standards shall provide at least as much protection from stormwater quantity and water quality impacts of major development projects as would be provided under the standards in N.J.A.C. 7:8-5. The standards in this ordinance always apply to new major development in areas with a combined sewer system or in areas with a separate sewer system that is either directly or indirectly connected to a combined sewer system.  
§ 4. - Stormwater Management Requirements for Major Development. 
A.  The development shall incorporate a maintenance plan for the stormwater management measures incorporated into the design of a major development in accordance with Section 10. 
B.  Stormwater management measures shall avoid adverse impacts of concentrated flow on habitat for threatened and endangered species as documented in the Department's Landscape Project or Natural Heritage Database established under N.J.S.A. 13:lB-15.147 through 15.150, particularly Helonias bullata (swamp pink) and/or Clemmys muhlnebergi (bog turtle). 
C.  The following linear development projects are exempt from the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality requirements of Sections 4.F and 4.G: 
1.  The construction of an underground utility line provided that the disturbed areas are revegetated upon completion; 
2.  The construction of an aboveground utility line provided that the existing conditions are maintained to the maximum extent practicable; and 
3.  The construction of a public pedestrian access, such as a sidewalk or trail with a maximum width of fourteen (14) feet, provided that the access is made of permeable material. 
D.  A waiver from strict compliance from the groundwater recharge, stormwater runoff quantity, and stormwater runoff quality requirements of Sections 4.F and 4.G may be obtained for the enlargement of an existing public roadway or railroad; or the construction or enlargement of a public pedestrian access, provided that the following conditions are met: 
1.  The applicant demonstrates that there is a public need for the project that cannot be accomplished by any other means; 
2.  The applicant demonstrates through an alternatives analysis, that through the use of nonstructural and structural stormwater management strategies and measures, the option selected complies with the requirements of Sections 4.F and 4.G to the maximum extent practicable; 
3.  The applicant demonstrates that, in order to meet the requirements of Sections 4.F and 4.G, existing structures currently in use, such as homes and buildings, would need to be condemned, and 
4.  The applicant demonstrates that it does not own or have other rights to areas, including the potential to obtain through condemnation lands not falling under D.3 above within the upstream drainage area of the receiving stream, that would provide additional opportunities to mitigate the requirements of Sections 4.F and 4.G that were not achievable on-site. 
E.  Nonstructural Stormwater Management Strategies. 
1.  To the maximum extent practicable, the standards in Sections 4.F and 4.G shall be met by incorporating nonstructural stormwater management strategies set forth at Section 4.E into the design. The applicant shall identify the nonstructural measures incorporated into the design of the project. If the applicant contends that it is not feasible for engineering, environmental, or safety reasons to incorporate any nonstructural stormwater management measures identified in Paragraph 2 below into the design of a particular project, the applicant shall identify the strategy considered and provide a basis for the contention. 
2.  Nonstructural stormwater management strategies incorporated into site design shall: 
a.  Protect areas that provide water quality benefits or areas particularly susceptible to erosion and sediment loss; 
b.  Minimize impervious surfaces and break up or disconnect the flow of runoff over impervious surfaces; 
c.  Maximize the protection of natural drainage features and vegetation; 
d.  Minimize the decrease in the "time of concentration" from pre-construction to post construction. "Time of concentration" is defined as the time it takes for runoff to travel from the hydraulically most distant point of the watershed to the point of interest within a watershed; 
e.  Minimize land disturbance including clearing and grading; 
f.  Minimize soil compaction; 
g.  Provide low-maintenance landscaping that encourages retention and planting of native vegetation and minimizes the use of lawns, fertilizers and pesticides; 
h.  Provide vegetated open-channel conveyance systems discharging into and through stable vegetated areas;

3.  Site design features identified under Section 4.E.2.i.(2) above shall comply with the following standard to control passage of solid and floatable materials through storm drain inlets. For purposes of this paragraph, "solid and floatable materials" means sediment, debris, trash, and other floating, suspended, or settleable solids. For exemptions to this standard see Section 4.E.3.c below. 
a.  Design engineers shall use either of the following grates whenever they use a grate in pavement or another ground surface to collect stormwater from that surface into a storm drain or surface water body under that grate: 
(1)  The New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) bicycle safe grate, which is described in Chapter 2.4 of the NJDOT Bicycle Compatible Roadways and Bikeways Planning and Design Guidelines (April 1996); or 
(2)  A different grate, if each individual clear space in that grate has an area of no more than seven square inches, or is no greater than one-half inches across the smallest dimension. 
Examples of grates subject to this standard include grates in grate inlets, the grate portion (non-curb-opening portion) of combination inlets, grates on storm sewer manholes, ditch grates, trench grates, and grates of spacer bars in slotted drains. Examples of ground surfaces include surfaces of roads (including bridges), driveways, parking areas, bikeways, plazas, sidewalks, lawns, fields, open channels, and stormwater basin floors. 
b.  Whenever design engineers use a curb-opening inlet, the clear space in that curb opening (or each individual clear space, if the curb opening has two or more clear spaces) shall have an area of no more than seven square inches, or be no greater than two inches across the smallest dimension. 
c.  This standard does not apply: 
(1)  Where the review agency determines that this standard would cause inadequate hydraulic performance that could not practicably be overcome by using additional or larger storm drain inlets that meet these standards; 
(2)  Where flows from the water quality design storm as specified in Section 4.G.1 are conveyed through any device (e.g., end of pipe netting facility, manufactured treatment device, or a catch basin hood) that is designed, at a minimum, to prevent delivery of all solid and floatable materials that could not pass through one of the following: 
(a)  A rectangular space four and five-eighths inches long and one and one-half inches wide (this option does not apply for outfall netting facilities); or 
(b)  A bar screen having a bar spacing of one-half inches. 
(3)  Where flows are conveyed through a trash rack that has parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars, to the elevation of the water quality design storm as specified in Section 4.G.1; or 
(4)  Where the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection determines, pursuant to the New Jersey Register of Historic Places Rules at N.J.A.C. 7:4-7.2(c), that action to meet this standard is an undertaking that constitutes an encroachment or will damage or destroy the New Jersey Register listed historic property. 
4.  Any land area used as a nonstructural stormwater management measure to meet the performance standards in Sections 4.F and 4.G shall be dedicated to a government agency, subjected to a conservation restriction filed with the appropriate County Clerk's office, or subject to an approved equivalent restriction that ensures that measure or an equivalent stormwater management measure approved by the reviewing agency is maintained in perpetuity. 
5.  Guidance for nonstructural stormwater management strategies is available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the address identified in Section 7, or found on the Department's website at www.njstormwater.org. 
F.  Erosion Control, Groundwater Recharge and Runoff Quantity Standards. 
1.  This subsection contains minimum design and performance standards to control erosion, encourage and control infiltration and groundwater recharge, and control stormwater runoff quantity impacts of major development. 
a.  The minimum design and performance standards for erosion control are those established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. and implementing rules. 
b.  The minimum design and performance standards for groundwater recharge are as follows: 
(1)  The design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff and groundwater recharge calculations at Section 5, either: 
(a)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the site and its stormwater management measures maintain one hundred (100) percent of the average annual pre-construction groundwater recharge volume for the site; or 
(b)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that the increase of stormwater runoff volume from pre-construction to post-construction for the two-year storm is infiltrated. 
(2)  This groundwater recharge requirement does not apply to projects within the "urban redevelopment area," or to projects subject to (3) below. 
(3)  The following types of stormwater shall not be recharged: 
(a)  Stormwater from areas of high pollutant loading. High pollutant loading areas are areas in industrial and commercial developments where solvents and/or petroleum products are loaded/unloaded, stored, or applied, areas where pesticides are loaded/unloaded or stored; areas where hazardous materials are expected to be present in greater than "reportable quantities" as defined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at 40 CFR 302.4; areas where recharge would be inconsistent with Department approved remedial action work plan or landfill closure plan and areas with high risks for spills of toxic materials, such as gas stations and vehicle maintenance facilities; and 
(b)  Industrial stormwater exposed to "source material." "Source material" means any material(s) or machinery, located at an industrial facility, that is directly or indirectly related to process, manufacturing or other industrial activities, which could be a source of pollutants in any industrial stormwater discharge to groundwater. Source materials include, but are not limited to, raw materials; intermediate products; final products; waste materials; by-products; industrial machinery and fuels, and lubricants, solvents, and detergents that are related to process, manufacturing, or other industrial activities that are exposed to stormwater. 
(4)  The design engineer shall assess the hydraulic impact on the groundwater table and design the site so as to avoid adverse hydraulic impacts. Potential adverse hydraulic impacts include, but are not limited to, exacerbating a naturally or seasonally high water table so as to cause surficial ponding, flooding of basements, or interference with the proper operation of subsurface sewage disposal systems and other subsurface structures in the vicinity or downgradient of the groundwater recharge area. 
c.  In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts from areas of the City with a separate storm sewer system that is neither directly nor indirectly connected to a combined sewer system, the design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at Section 5, complete one of the following. 
(1)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that for stormwater leaving the site, post-construction runoff hydrographs for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100)-year storm events do not exceed, at any point in time, the pre-construction runoff hydrographs for the same storm events; 
(2)  Demonstrate through hydrologic and hydraulic analysis that there is no increase, as compared to the pre-construction condition, in the peak runoff rates of stormwater leaving the site for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100)-year storm events and that the increased volume or change in timing of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damage at or downstream of the site. This analysis shall include the analysis of impacts of existing land uses and projected land uses assuming full development under existing zoning and land use ordinances in the drainage area; 
(3)  Design stormwater management measures so that the post-construction peak runoff rates for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100)-year storm events are fifty (50), seventy-five (75) and eighty (80) percent, respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The percentages apply only to the post-construction stormwater runoff that is attributable to the portion of the site on which the proposed development or project is to be constructed. The percentages shall not be applied to post-construction stormwater runoff into tidal flood hazard areas if the increased volume of stormwater runoff will not increase flood damages below the point of discharge; or 
(4)  In tidal flood hazard areas, stormwater runoff quantity analysis in accordance with (1), (2) and (3) above shall only be applied if the increased volume of stormwater runoff could increase flood damages below the point of discharge. 
d.  In order to control stormwater runoff quantity impacts from all areas of the City with a combined sewer system or with a sewer system that is either directly or indirectly connected to a combined sewer system, the design engineer shall, using the assumptions and factors for stormwater runoff calculations at Section 5, design Combined Sewer Subdrainage Area management measures so that the post-construction peak runoff rates for the two, ten (10), and one hundred (100)-year storm events are fifty (50), seventy-five (75) and eighty (80) percent, respectively, of the pre-construction peak runoff rates. The percentages apply only to the post-construction Combined Sewer Subdrainage Area runoff that is attributable to the portion of the site on which the proposed development or project is to be constructed. 
2.  Any application for a new agricultural development that meets the definition of major development at Section 2 shall be submitted to the appropriate Soil Conservation District for review and approval in accordance with the requirements of this section and any applicable Soil Conservation District guidelines for stormwater runoff quantity and erosion control. For the purposes of this section, "agricultural development" means land uses normally associated with the production of food, fiber and livestock for sale. Such uses do not include the development of land for the processing or sale of food and the manufacturing of agriculturally related products. 
G.  Stormwater Runoff Quality Standards. 
1.  Stormwater quality management measures shall be designed to reduce the post-construction load of total suspended solids (TSS) in stormwater runoff by eighty (80) percent of the anticipated load from the developed site, expressed as an annual average. Stormwater quality management measures shall only be required for major developments in areas with a separate sewer system that is neither directly nor indirectly connected to a combined sewer system. The requirement to reduce TSS does not apply to any stormwater runoff in a discharge regulated under a numeric effluent limitation for TSS imposed under the New Jersey Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NJPDES) rules, N.J.A.C. 7:14A, or in a discharge specifically exempt under a NJPDES permit from this requirement The water quality design storm is 1.25 inches of rainfall in two hours. Water quality calculations shall take into account the distribution of rain from the water quality design storm, as reflected in Table 1. The calculation of the volume of runoff may take into account the implementation of non-structural and structural stormwater management measures.

2.  For purposes of TSS reduction calculations, Table 2 below presents the presumed removal rates for certain BMPs designed in accordance with the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. The BMP Manual may be obtained from the address identified in Section 7, or found on the Department's website at www.njstormwater.org. The BMP Manual and other sources of technical guidance are listed in Section 7. TSS reduction shall be calculated based on the removal rates for the BMPs in Table 2 below. Alternative removal rates and methods of calculating removal rates may be used if the design engineer provides documentation demonstrating the capability of these alternative rates and methods to the review agency. A copy of any approved alternative rate or method of calculating the removal rate shall be provided to the Department at the following address: Division of Watershed Management, New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, PO Box 418 Trenton, New Jersey, 08625-0418. 
3.  If more than one BMP in series is necessary to achieve the required eighty (80) percent TSS reduction for a site, the applicant shall utilize the following formula to calculate TSS reduction: 
R = A+B - (AXB)/100 
Where 
R = total TSS percent load removal from application of both BMPs, and 
A = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the first BMP 
B = the TSS percent removal rate applicable to the second BMP 
Table 2: TSS Removal Rates for BMPs 
Best Management Practice 	TSS Percent Removal Rate 
Bioretention Systems 	90 
Constructed Stormwater Wetland 	90 
Extended Detention Basin 	40-60 
Infiltration Structure 	80 
Manufactured Treatment Device 	See Section 6.C 
Send Filter 	80 
Vegetative Filter Strip 	60-80 
Wet Pond 	50-90 
 
4.  If there is more than one onsite drainage area, the eighty (80) percent TSS removal rate shall apply to each drainage area, unless the runoff from the subareas converge on site in which case the removal rate can be demonstrated through a calculation using a weighted avenge. 
5.  Stormwater management measures shall also be designed to reduce, to the maximum extent feasible, the post-construction nutrient load of the anticipated load from the developed site in stormwater runoff generated from the water quality design storm. In achieving reduction of nutrients to the maximum extent feasible, the design of the site shall include nonstructural strategies and structural measures that optimize nutrient removal while still achieving the performance standards in Sections 4.F and 4.G. 
6.  Additional information and examples are contained in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual, which may be obtained from the address identified in Section 7. 
7.  In accordance with the definition of FWI at N.J.A.C. 7:9B-l.4, stormwater management measures shall be designed to prevent any increase in stormwater runoff to waters classified as FWI. 
8.  Special water resource protection areas shall be established along all waters designated Category One at N.J.A.C. 7:9B, and perennial or intermittent streams that drain into or upstream of the Category One waters as shown on the USGS Quadrangle Maps or in the County Soil Surveys, within the associated HUC14 drainage area. These areas shall be established for the protection of water quality, aesthetic value, exceptional ecological significance, exceptional recreational significance, exceptional water supply significance, and exceptional fisheries significance of those established Category One waters. These areas shall be designated and protected as follows: 
a.  The applicant shall preserve and maintain a special water resource protection area in accordance with one of the following: 
(1)  A three hundred (300)-foot special water resource protection area shall be provided on each side of the waterway, measured perpendicular to the waterway from the top of the bank outwards or from the centerline of the waterway where the bank is not defined, consisting of existing vegetation or vegetation allowed to follow natural succession is provided. 
(2)  Encroachment within the designated special water resource protection area under Subsection (1) above shall only he allowed where previous development or disturbance has occurred (for example, active agricultural use, parking area or maintained lawn area). The encroachment shall only be allowed where applicant demonstrates that the functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area will be maintained to the maximum extent practicable. In no case shall the remaining special water resource protection area be reduced to less than one hundred (150) feet as measured perpendicular to the top of bank of the waterway or centerline of the waterway where the bank is undefined. All encroachments proposed under this subparagraph shall be subject to review and approval by the Department. 
b.  All stormwater shall be discharged outside of and flow through the special water resource protection area and shall comply with the Standard for Off-Site Stability in the "Standards For Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq. 
c.  If stormwater discharged outside of and flowing through the special water resource protection area cannot comply with the Standard For Off-Site Stability in the "Standards for Soil Erosion and Sediment Control in New Jersey," established under the Soil Erosion and Sediment Control Act, N.J.S.A. 4:24-39 et seq., then the stabilization measures in accordance with the requirements of the above standards may be placed within the special water resource protection area, provided that: 
(1)  Stabilization measures shall not be placed within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the Category One waterway; 
(2)  Stormwater associated with discharges allowed by this section shall achieve a ninety-five (95) percent TSS post-construction removal rate; 
(3)  Temperature shall be addressed to ensure no impact on the receiving waterway; 
(4)  The encroachment shall only be allowed where the applicant demonstrates that the functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area will be maintained to the maximum extent practicable; 
(5)  A conceptual project design meeting shall be held with the appropriate Department staff and Soil Conservation District staff to identify necessary stabilization measures; and 
(6)  All encroachments proposed under this section shall be subject to review and approval by the Department. 
d.  A stream corridor protection plan may be developed by a regional stormwater management planning committee as an element of a regional stormwater management plan, or by a municipality through an adopted municipal stormwater management plan. If a stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to Section 4.G(8) has been approved by the Department of Environmental Protection, then the provisions of the plan shall be the applicable special water resource protection area requirements for that waterway. A stream corridor protection plan for a waterway subject to G.8 shall maintain or enhance the current functional value and overall condition of the special water resource protection area as defined in G.8.a.(l) above. In no case shall a stream corridor protection plan allow the reduction of the Special Water Resource Protection Area to less than one hundred fifty (150) feet as measured perpendicular to the waterway subject to this subsection. 
e.  Paragraph G.8 does not apply to the construction of one individual single family dwelling that is not part of a larger development on a lot receiving preliminary or final subdivision approval on or before February 2, 2004, provided that the construction begins on or before February 2, 2009.  
§ 5. - Calculation of Stormwater Runoff and Groundwater Recharge. 
A.  Stormwater runoff shall be calculated in accordance with the following: 
1.  The design engineer shall calculate runoff using one of the following methods: 
a.  The USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) methodology, including the NRCS Runoff Equation and Dimensionless Unit Hydrograph, as described in the NRCS National Engineering Handbook Section 4  Hydrology and Technical Release 55  Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds; or 
b.  The Rational Method for peak flow and the Modified Rational Method for hydrograph computations. 
2.  For the purpose of calculating runoff coefficients and groundwater recharge, there is a presumption that the pre-construction condition of a site or portion thereof is a wooded land use with good hydrologic condition. The term "runoff coefficient" applies to both the NRCS methodology at Section 5.A.l.a and the Rational and Modified Rational Methods at Section 5.A.l.b. A runoff coefficient or a groundwater recharge land cover for an existing condition may be used on all or a portion of the site if the design engineer verifies that the hydrologic condition has existed on the site or portion of the site for at least five years without interruption prior to the time of application. If more than one land cover have existed on the site during the five years immediately prior to the time of application, the land cover with the lowest runoff potential shall be used for the computations. In addition, there is the presumption that the site is in good hydrologic condition (if the land use type is pasture, lawn, or park), with good cover (if the land use type is woods), or with good hydrologic condition and conservation treatment (if the land use type is cultivation). 
3.  In computing pre-construction stormwater runoff, the design engineer shall account for all significant land features and structures, such as ponds, wetlands, depressions, hedgerows, or culverts, that may reduce pre-construction stormwater runoff rates and volumes. 
4.  In computing stormwater runoff from all design storms, the design engineer shall consider the relative stormwater runoff rates and/or volumes of pervious and impervious surfaces separately to accurately compute the rates and volume of stormwater runoff from the site. To calculate runoff from unconnected impervious cover, urban impervious area modifications as described in the NRCS Technical Release 55Urban Hydrology for Small Watersheds and other methods may be employed. 
5.  If the invert of the outlet structure of a stormwater management measure is below the flood hazard design flood elevation as defined at N.J.A.C. 7:13, the design engineer shall take into account the effects of tailwater in the design of structural stormwater management measures. 
B.  Groundwater recharge may be calculated in accordance with the following: 
1.  The New Jersey Geological Survey Report GSR-32 A Method fur Evaluating Ground-Water Recharge Areas in New Jersey, incorporated herein by reference as amended and supplemented. Information regarding the methodology is available from the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual; at http://www.state.nj.us/dep/njgs/; or at New Jersey Geological Survey, 29 Arctic Parkway, P.O.

§ 6. - Standards for Structural Stormwater Management Measures. 
A.  Standards for structural stormwater management measures are as follows: 
1.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to take into account the existing site conditions, including, for example, environmentally critical areas, wetlands; flood-prone areas; slopes; depth to seasonal high water table; soil type, permeability and texture; drainage area and drainage patterns; and the presence of solution-prone carbonate rocks (limestone). 
2.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed to minimize maintenance, facilitate maintenance and repairs, and ensure proper functioning. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet structure as appropriate, and shall have parallel bars with one-inch spacing between the bars to the elevation of the water quality design storm. For elevations higher than the water quality design storm, the parallel bars at the outlet structure shall be spaced no greater than one-third the width of the diameter of the orifice or one-third the width of the weir, with a minimum spacing between bars of one-inch and a maximum spacing between bars of six inches. In addition, the design of trash racks must comply with the requirements of Section 8.D. 
3.  Structural stormwater management measures shall be designed, constructed, and installed to be strong, durable, and corrosion resistant. Measures that are consistent with the relevant portions of the Residential Site Improvement Standards at N.J.A.C. 5:21-7.3, 7.4, and 7.5 shall be deemed to meet this requirement. 
4.  At the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin, the orifice size shall be a minimum of two and one-half inches in diameter. 
5.  Stormwater management basins shall be designed to meet the minimum safety standards for stormwater management basins at Section 8. 
B.  Stormwater management measure guidelines are available in the New Jersey Stormwater Best Management Practices Manual. Other stormwater management measures may be utilized provided the design engineer demonstrates that the proposed measure and its design will accomplish the required water quantity, groundwater recharge and water quality design and performance standards established by Section 4 of this ordinance. 
C.  Manufactured treatment devices may be used to meet the requirements of Section 4 of this ordinance, provided the pollutant removal rates are verified by the New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology and certified by the Department.

A.  This section sets forth requirements to protect public safety through the proper design and operation of stormwater management basins. This section applies to any new stormwater management basin. 
B.  Requirements for Trash Racks, Overflow Grates and Escape Provisions. 
1.  A trash rack is a device designed to catch trash and debris and prevent the clogging of outlet structures. Trash racks shall be installed at the intake to the outlet from the stormwater management basin to ensure proper functioning of the basin outlets in accordance with the following: 
a.  The trash rack shall have parallel bars, with no greater than six inch spacing between the bars.

A.  Performance Guarantees Required. 
1.  Prior to the granting of final approval of a subdivision or site plan, the applicant shall have installed or shall have furnished performance guarantees for the ultimate installation of the improvements that were shown on the approved preliminary plan, required as a condition of preliminary approval, or, in the case of subdivisions only, required by the provisions of the "Map Filing Law." 
2.  Improvements for which performance guarantees may be required include without limitation: streets, grading, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks, street lighting, shade trees, surveyor's monuments, water mains, culverts, storm sewers, sanitary sewers or other means of sewage disposal, drainage structures, erosion control and sedimentation control devices, public improvements of open space, and, in the case of site plans only, landscaping and other on-site improvements. 
3.  The applicant shall file with the City Clerk a performance guarantee in favor of the City of Jersey City insuring the installation of all uncompleted improvements on or before an agreed upon date. The cost of installation of the required improvements shall be estimated by the City Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53, and the amount of the performance guarantee shall be of an amount equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of this estimated cost. Ten percent (10%) of the performance guarantee must be in the form of cash. 
4.  The form and sufficiency of the guarantee shall be subject to approval of the City Attorney. Performance guarantees shall be expressly conditioned upon the developer's full compliance with all City ordinances and regulations governing the installation of improvements and utilities and faithful performance of the terms of any developer's agreement with the City. 
5.  The time allowed for installation of the improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by the City Council by resolution. As a condition or as part of any such extension, the amount of any performance guarantee shall be increased or reduced, as the case may be, to an amount equal to one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the cost of the installation as determined by the City Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 as of the time of the passage of the resolution. 
6.  If the required improvements are not completed or corrected in accordance with the performance guarantee, the obligor and surety, if any, shall be liable thereon to the City for the reasonable cost of the improvements not completed or corrected, and the City may either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof complete such improvements. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be subject to the public bidding requirements of the "Local Public Contracts Law." 
7.  Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements (except the top course) and appurtenant utility improvements, and the connection of same to the public system, the obligor may notify the City Council in writing, by certified mail addressed in care of the City Clerk, that the City Engineer prepare, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee, a list of all uncompleted or unsatisfactory completed improvements. If such a request is made, the obligor shall send a copy of the request to the City Engineer. The request shall indicate which improvements have been completed and which improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment of the obligor. Thereupon the City engineer shall inspect all improvements covered by obligor's request and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, with the City Council, and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof to the obligor not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the obligor's request. 
8.  The list prepared by the City Engineer shall state, in detail, with respect to each improvement determined to be incomplete or unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the incompleteness of each incomplete improvement or the nature and extent of, and remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed improvement determined to be unsatisfactory. The report prepared by the City Engineer shall identify each improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory together with a recommendation as to the amount or reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the completed and satisfactory improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee. 
9.  The City Council, by resolution, shall either approve the improvements determined to be complete and satisfactory by the City Engineer, or reject any or all of these improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for rejection, and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee. This resolution shall be adopted not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the City Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the City Council, the obligor shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance guarantee, with respect to those approved improvements, except for that portion adequately sufficient to secure completion or correction of the improvements not yet approved; provided that thirty percent (30%) of the amount of the total performance guarantee posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements. 
10.  For the purpose of releasing the obligor from liability pursuant to its performance guarantee, the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each approved improvement shall be reduced by the total amount of each such improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee, including any contingency factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of the approved improvements would exceed seventy percent (70%) of the total amount of the performance guarantee, then the City may retain thirty percent (30%) of the amount of the total performance guarantee to ensure completion and acceptability of all improvements, as provided above. 
11.  If the City Engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as requested by the obligor pursuant to subsection (G) of this section within forty-five (45) days from receipt of the request, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling the City Engineer to provide the list and report within a stated time and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party. 
12.  If the City Council fails to approve or reject the improvements determined by the City Engineer to be complete and satisfactory or reduce the performance guarantee for the complete and satisfactory improvements within forty-five (45) days from the receipt of the City Engineer's list and report, the obligor may apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling, within a stated time, approval of the complete and satisfactory improvements and approval of a reduction in the performance guarantee for the approvable complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance with the itemized cost estimate prepared by the City Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee; and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable attorneys fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party. 
13.  In the event that the obligor has made a cash deposit with the City as part of the performance guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in the performance guarantee pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the cash deposit in the same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of the performance guarantee. 
14.  If any portion of the required improvements are rejected, the City Council may require the obligor to complete or correct such improvements and, upon completion or correction, the same procedure of notification, as set forth in this section shall be followed. 
15.  Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the obligor to contest by legal proceedings any determination of the City Council or the City Engineer. 
16.  In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development, the provisions of this section shall be applied by stage or section. 
17.  To the extent that any of the improvements have been dedicated to the City on the subdivision plat or site plan, the City Council shall be deemed upon the release of any performance guarantee required, to accept dedication for public use of streets or roads and any other improvements made thereon according to site plans and subdivisions plats approved by the Board, provided that such improvements have been inspected and have received final approval by the City Engineer. 
B.  Maintenance Guarantees Required. 
1.  Upon completion and acceptance by the City Council of the required improvements or a portion of such improvements, the developer may be required to post a maintenance guarantee with the City Council for a period not to exceed two years after final acceptance of the improvement, in an amount not to exceed fifteen percent (15%) of the cost of the improvement, as determined by the City Engineer pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. 
2.  The form and sufficiency of the maintenance guarantee shall be approved by the City Attorney. The maintenance guarantee for an improvement shall be posted upon final release by the City Council of the performance guarantee for that improvement and shall be expressly conditioned upon the maintenance by the developer of such improvement for a period of two years, and particularly shall guarantee the remedy of any defects in such improvement which occur during that period. 
3.  Maintenance of Landscaped Areas. All landscaped areas must be properly maintained. In the event that an applicant shall at any time after the issuance of a certificate of occupancy fail to maintain any landscaped areas, the Zoning Official shall serve written notice setting forth any failure to maintain said landscaped area in a reasonable condition, and said notice shall include a demand that such deficiencies be cured within four weeks thereof and shall state the date and place of any hearing thereon which may be held. If the deficiencies set forth in the original notice or in any modification thereof are not cured within said four weeks or any extension thereof the Zoning Official, in order to preserve the taxable value of the surrounding property and to prevent the landscaped areas from becoming a public nuisance, shall revoke the zoning permit issued to said premises until such time as the deficiencies are cured. 
4.  In the event that other governmental agencies or public utilities automatically will own the utilities to be installed or the improvements are covered by a performance or maintenance guarantee to another governmental agency, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case may be, shall be required by the City for such utilities or improvements. 
5.  Appeal Procedure for Disputed Guarantee Amounts. The cost of the installation of improvements shall be estimated by the City Engineer based on documented construction costs for public improvements prevailing in the general area of the City. The developer may appeal the City Engineer's estimate to the county construction board of appeals. 
C.  Acceptance of Guarantee. The City Council shall accept a performance guarantee or maintenance guarantee which is an irrevocable letter of credit if it: 
1.  Constitutes an unconditional payment obligation of the issuer running solely to the City for an express initial period of time in the amount determined pursuant to subsection (A) of this section; 
2.  Is issued by a banking or savings institution authorized to do and doing business in this State; 
3.  Is for a period of time at least one year; and 
4.  Permits the City to draw upon the letter of credit if the obligor fails to furnish another letter of credit which complies with the provisions of this section thirty (30) days or more in advance of the expiration date of the letter of credit or such longer period in advance thereof as is stated in the letter of credit.
