the existence of a defect in any of the playground equipment, playing
fields, paths, grounds of any playground or public park owned, operated
or maintained by the City of Beacon or for a defect in any such
equipment, place or facility maintained at a public bathing beach,
skating rink or pond owned, operated or maintained by the City of
Beacon unless, prior to the occurrence resulting in such damage or
injury, written notice of the existence of such defect relating to the
particular equipment, playing fields, paths, grounds of any playground
or public park owned, operated or maintained by the City of Beacon
shall have been filed in the office of the City Clerk of the city and unless
it shall be made to appear that there was a failure or neglect to remedy
or repair such alleged defect or condition in the equipment, facility or
place or to cause the equipment, facility or place to be otherwise made
reasonably safe within a reasonable time after the filing of such notice.
C. All claims against the city for damages or injuries to person or property
alleged to have been caused by the misfeasance or negligence of the

accident or injury out of which the claim arose. Such writing shall

circumstances under which the damages or injuries were sustained and
the cause thereof; it shall also state, so far as then practicable, the

therefor against the city; but no action shall be brought upon any such
claim until thirty (30) days have elapsed after the presentation of the
claim to the City Council.

existing requirement or statute of limitations which is applicable to this
class of actions, but on the contrary shall be held to be an additional
requirement to the rights to maintain such action, nor shall anything
herein contained be held to modify any existing rule of law relative to
the question of contributory negligence nor to impose upon the city any
greater duty or obligation than that it shall keep its streets and public
places in a reasonably safe condition for public use and travel.
E. The place of trial of all actions or proceedings against the city or any of
its officers, boards or departments shall be the County of Dutchess.

ARTICLE I
Rules of Construction; General Penalty
[Adopted 1-17-1972 as Ch. 1 of the 1972 Code of Ordinances]
§ 1-1. Catch lines.1
The catch lines of the several sections of this Code printed in boldface type
are intended as mere catch words to indicate the contents of the section and
shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections nor as any part of
the section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when
any of such sections, including the catch lines, are amended or reenacted.
§ 1-2. Rules of construction; definitions.
A. In the construction of this Code and of all ordinances, the following
rules shall be observed, unless such construction would be inconsistent
with the manifest intent of the City Council:
(1) Generally. The provisions of this Code shall be liberally construed
to effect the purposes expressed therein or implied from the
expression thereof. In case of doubt or ambiguity in the meaning of
such provisions the general shall yield to the particular. Reference
for interpretation and construction shall tend to further the
accomplishment of the elimination of the particular mischiefs for
which the provisions were enacted. Words shall be construed in
their common and usual significance unless the contrary is clearly
indicated.
(2) City; corporation. Whenever the words "the City," "this City," "the
corporation" or "this corporation" are used, they shall be construed
as if the words "of Beacon, New York," followed them.
(3) Computation of time. Whenever a notice is required to be given or
an act to be done, a certain length of time before any proceeding
shall be had, the day on which such notice is given or such act is
done shall be counted in computing the time, but the day on which
such proceeding is to be had shall not be counted.
(4) Delegation of authority. Whenever a provision appears requiring
the head of a department of the City to do some act or make certain
inspections, it is to be construed to authorize the head of the
department to designate, delegate and authorize subordinates to
perform the required act or make the required inspection unless
the terms of the provision or section designates otherwise.
(5) Gender. A word importing the masculine gender only shall extend
and be applied to females and to firms, partnerships and
corporations as well as to males.
1. Editor's Note: Original § 1-1, How Code designated and cited, which immediately preceded
this section, was deleted 3-16-1992 by L.L. No. 2-1992.
§ 1-1 CHARTER § 1-2
C:41
(6) Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of any
provision of this Code, it shall be held to be the minimum
requirements adopted for the promotion of the public health,
safety, comfort, convenience and general welfare. Where any
provision of the Code imposes greater restrictions upon the subject
matter than the general provision imposed by the Code, the
provision imposing the greater restriction or regulation shall be
deemed to be controlling.
(7) Joint authority. All words giving a joint authority to three or more
persons or officers shall be construed as giving such authority to a
majority of such persons or officers.
(8) Name of officer. Whenever the name of an officer is given, it shall
be construed as though the words "of the City of Beacon" were
added.
(9) Nontechnical and technical words. Words and phrases shall be
construed according to the common and approved usage of the
language, but technical words and phrases and such others as may
have acquired a peculiar and appropriate meaning in law shall be
construed and understood according to such meaning.
(10) Number. A word importing the singular number only may extend
and be applied to several persons and things as well as to one
person and thing.
(11) Or; and. "Or" may be read "and," and "and" may be read "or" if the
sense requires it.
(12) Tense. Words used in the past or present tense shall include the
future as well as the past and present.

similar provisions for the legal and financial security of its officers and
employees and further finds that such security is also required for local
personnel. By enactment of this chapter, the City Council does not intend to
limit or otherwise abrogate any existing right or responsibility of the City
of Beacon or its employees with regard to indemnification or legal defense.
It is solely the intent of this chapter to provide similar coverage for local
employees as is presently provided for state employees, so as to continue to
attract qualified individuals to local government service.

purporting to act within the scope of his or her public employment and
duties or which was brought to enforce a provision of §§ 1981 through

represented by the City Attorney or an attorney employed or retained

City to such employed or retained attorney from time to time during the

a default judgment pending resolution of any question pertaining to the
obligation to provide for a defense.
A. Subject to the condition set forth in this chapter, the City shall
indemnify and save harmless its employees in the amount of any
judgment, including a judgment that includes punitive or exemplary
damages, obtained against such employee in any state or federal court

any claim brought against such employee, provided that the employee
has complied with the provisions of § 21-5 of this chapter, and further
provided that the act or omission from which such judgment or

reviewed and approved by the City Council.

settlement of the claim, the employee shall serve a copy of such

of the officers and employees of the City of Beacon. The rules of ethical

MUNICIPAL IDENTIFICATION PROGRAM
§ 42-1. Legislative findings, intent and purpose.
A. The City Council finds that many residents of the City of Beacon
oftentimes do not have access to various forms of identification and
thus have difficulty obtaining services, such as bank accounts, access to
health care services, as well as access to public/government buildings.
This barrier leaves thousands of individuals, including immigrants,
homeless people, transgender people, senior citizens, young people,
and those who have been formerly incarcerated, without access to
critical services. It is the intent of the City Council to build the City of
Beacon's standing as a welcoming and inclusive center for all residents,
without regard to a person's race, national origin, religion, sex, sexual
orientation, gender identity, disability, immigration, housing, or
financial status.
B. Residents' lack of access to acceptable forms of identification also
raises public safety concerns for the City. Residents without access to
bank accounts often carry large amounts of money on their person or
store it in their home making them targets for crime. In addition,
residents who cannot produce proof of identity are often reluctant to
report crimes to the police that they suffer or witness. Studies show
that immigrant populations in particular are victimized by crime at
rates similar to or greater than the general population, but immigrant
populations report crime at lower rates than the general population.
This underreporting of crime poses a serious public safety problem and
erodes the ability of law enforcement to function effectively in the City.
C. A City of Beacon identification card would serve to reduce the impact of
the above-mentioned conditions, improve public safety, and enable all
City of Beacon residents to participate more fully in and become an
integral part of the community. A City of Beacon identification card

§ 34-3 BEACON CODE § 42-1

§ 42-2. Disclaimer.
The City of Beacon is providing the Beacon ID card for identification and
access to services provided by the City of Beacon. The City does not act
as guarantor or warrantor of either of the information provided by the
applicant for the Beacon ID card or of/against acts, criminal or otherwise
committed by the individual(s) while possessing or using the Beacon ID
card. The City does not waive any of its protections afforded under federal,
state or local laws, by processing or issuing the Beacon ID cards.
§ 42-3. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BEACON ID CARD  An identification card issued by the City of Beacon
that shall, at a minimum, display the cardholder's photograph, name, date
of birth, address, ID card number, and card expiration date. Such
identification card shall be designed in a manner to deter fraud which
may include bar codes, serial numbers, watermarks, City Seal, or other
security measures used to protect against fraud. Additionally, the card
does not bestow eligibility for state or federal financial benefits, therefore
significantly reducing the incentive to fraudulently obtain an ID card.
CITY  The City of Beacon or any department, agency, board, or
commission thereof.
RESIDENT  A person who can establish that he or she is a current
resident of the City of Beacon pursuant to § 42-6.
would encourage crime reporting and witness cooperation, both key
elements in building a safer community. Such cards would also
potentially enable more City residents to open bank accounts, access
parks or other public facilities, and receive resident discounts at local
businesses, events, and arts institutions. The cards would also benefit
children and youth who become lost and normally possess no
identification or emergency contact information and elderly citizens
who no longer drive and therefore no longer possess a valid driver's
license. Accordingly, it is in the best interests of its residents for the
City to issue its own municipal identification card.
D. By authorizing the creation of this program, the City Council does not
intend to expand identification requirements for access to basic
services or exercise of constitutional rights. The program should not be
used as a proxy to require individuals to produce government-issued
identification to access services and benefits where such identification
is not presently required, such as registering to vote or casting a ballot.

§ 42-4. Beacon ID card program.
The City Clerk shall act as the custodian of all records and applications.

origin, alienage or citizenship status, gender identity, sexual
orientation, disability, marital status, partnership status, any lawful
source of income, housing status, status as a victim of domestic
violence or status as a victim of sex offenses or stalking, or conviction or
arrest record, provided that such resident is able to meet the
requirements for establishing his or her identity and residency as set
forth in this chapter.
B. The City shall establish an application fee for municipal identification
cards of $10 for adults and $5 for people under the age of 18 or over the
age of 62.
C. The Beacon ID card shall be valid for a period of two years from the
date of issuance, and thereafter must be renewed for a fee of $5 in
order to keep the ID card active. Only residents with a valid, active
Beacon ID card shall be eligible to receive Beacon ID card benefits.

shall be deemed to have been approved, and the certificate of the City
as to the date of submission of the plat for approval and the failure of
the City Planning Board to take action within such time shall be issued

unless, within such ninety-day period, such plat shall have been duly
filed or recorded by the owner in the office of the County Clerk. The City
Clerk is hereby authorized and charged with the duty of filing in the
office of the County Clerk a certificate showing that the City Planning
Board has been so authorized and that the City Clerk shall issue the
aforementioned certificate of failure to take action as aforesaid.
B. Before the approval of the City Planning Board of a plat, such plat shall

to provide access of fire-fighting equipment to buildings to be
coordinated so as to compose a convenient system conforming to the
Master Plan; that the land shown on such plats shall be of such a
character that it can be used safely for building purposes without
danger to health or peril from fire, flood or other menace; that suitable
monuments have been placed at such block corners and other
§ 45-10 BEACON CODE § 45-11
43:166
necessary points as may be required by the City Planning Board, and
the location thereof is shown on the map of such plat; that the parks
shall be of reasonable size for neighborhood playgrounds or other
recreational uses; that all streets or other public places shown on
such plats shall be suitably graded and paved; and that sidewalks,
streetlighting standards, curbs, gutters, street trees, water mains,
sanitary sewers and storm drains or combined sewers shall be installed
in accordance with standards, specifications and procedures acceptable
to the appropriate municipal departments or that, alternatively, a
performance bond sufficient to cover the full cost of the same as
estimated by the City Planning Board or other appropriate municipal
department designated by the City Planning Board shall be furnished
to the municipality by the owner; provided, however, that the City
Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions and
guaranties, for such period as it may determine, the provision of any or
all such improvements as, in its judgment of the special circumstances
of a particular plat or plats, are not requisite in the interests of the
public health, safety and general welfare. Such performance bond shall
be issued by a bonding or surety company approved by the City
Attorney of the City or a performance bond executed by the owner with
security acceptable to the legislative body and shall also be approved
by the City Attorney as to sufficiency and manner of execution. Such
performance bond shall run for a term to be fixed by the City Planning
Board, but in no case for a longer term than three years; provided,
however, that the term of the performance bond may be extended
by the City Planning Board with consent of the parties thereto. If
the City Planning Board shall decide at any time during the term of
the performance bond that the extent of building development that
has taken place in the subdivision is not sufficient to warrant all the
improvements covered by such performance bond or that required
improvements have been installed as provided in this section and
required by the City Planning Board in sufficient amount to warrant
reduction in the face amount of such bond, the City Planning Board,
after due notice and public hearing, may modify its requirements for
any and all such improvements, and the face value of such performance
bond shall thereupon be reduced by an appropriate amount so that
the new face value will cover the cost in full of the amended list of
improvements required by the City Planning Board, and any security
deposited with the bond may be reduced proportionately. In the event
that any required improvements have not been installed within the
term of the performance bond, the legislative body may thereupon
declare the performance bond in default and collect the sum remaining
thereunder, and, upon the receipt of the proceeds thereof, the City
shall install such improvements as are covered by such performance
bond and commensurate with the building development that has taken
place in the subdivision but not exceeding in cost the amount of such
proceeds.
C. In making such determination regarding streets, highways, parks and
required improvements, the City Planning Board shall take into

require approval of a plat, map or plan of land as prerequisite of its

force insofar as they apply to plats, maps and plans of land within the
limit of this municipality.
A. For the purpose of providing for the future growth and development of
the City and affording adequate facilities for the housing,
transportation, distribution, comfort, convenience, safety, health and
welfare of its population, the City Planning Board is hereby authorized
and empowered to approve the development of plats, entirely or
partially undeveloped and which have been filed in the office of the
Dutchess County Clerk prior to the appointment of the City Planning
Board on October 6, 1958.
B. Prior to taking action in accordance with the above authority, the City
Planning Board shall prepare and adopt an amendment or amendments
to the City's Land Subdivision Regulations22 so as to establish the
procedures and standards to be followed in identifying such entirely or
partially undeveloped plats and replanning them.

anticipated bids for the contract that it appears unlikely that
the bidder will be able to perform the contract satisfactorily at
the price bid.
(l) Any other cause of so serious or compelling a nature that it
raises questions about the present responsibility of a
contractor or subcontractor, including but not limited to

contracting agencies to bear upon responsibility, including but
limited to any mitigating factors brought to the agency's attention
by the bidder or proposed subcontractor.
B. Definitions and word usage.
(1) As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BIDDER, CONTRACTOR  Any person or entity submitting a bid
or proposal in response to a published bid or request for proposals
issued by the City of Beacon in connection with a contract for
public works or the purchasing of goods or services when required
by § 103 of the General Municipal Law.
CONTRACT  Any contract for public works requiring an
expenditure in excess of $35,000 and any purchase contract
requiring an expenditure in excess of $20,000. Unless otherwise
specified, all contracts shall be submitted for competitive bidding
in accordance with § 103 of the General Municipal Law and
awarded on the basis of lowest responsible bidder. Purchase
contracts, however, may be awarded on the basis of best value,
if the procedures set forth in § 53-2 are selected for a particular
request for proposals, or pursuant to the piggyback provision in
§ 53-3. Competitive bidding shall not be required for a contract
for public works of $35,000 or less and for purchase contracts of
$20,000 or less.
CONTRACTING AGENCY  The City of Beacon and any
department, officer, board or agency thereof responsible for
awarding any contract let pursuant to this chapter.
SUBCONTRACTOR  Any person or entity offered by a bidder or
contractor to furnish all or part of the goods, services or work to be
performed under a contract let pursuant to this chapter.
(2) A corporation, partnership or proprietorship shall be considered to
be an "affiliate" of the bidder or proposed subcontractor if one
owns, controls or has the ability to control the other, or if a third
person, corporation, partnership or proprietorship owns, controls
or has the ability to control both.
A. Purpose. The City Council of the City of Beacon hereby finds that
contracts for goods required by law to be procured pursuant to
competitive bidding, pursuant to § 103 of the General Municipal Law,
should be procured in a manner so as to assure the prudent and
economical use of public monies, in the best interests of the taxpayers,
to facilitate the acquisition of goods of maximum quality at the lowest
price possible under the circumstances, and to guard against
favoritism, extravagance, fraud and corruption. The Council finds
further that while the lowest responsible bidder has been the
§ 53-1 BEACON CODE § 53-2
47:178
historically accepted method of awarding such contracts, the lowest
responsible bidder may not offer the most cost-effective or efficient
option long term. Accordingly, the Council wishes to exercise its
authority pursuant to General Municipal Law § 103, Subdivision 1, to
adopt the within standards permitting the City, and its bodies, officers
and agents, to apply the "best value" standard for awarding purchase
contracts.
B. Award of contracts to other than lowest responsible bidder.
(1) Any purchase contract awarded by the City shall be awarded on the
basis of lowest responsible bidder unless the City Administrator
authorizes an award on the basis of "best value." For purposes of
this chapter, "best value" shall be defined as set forth in § 163,
Subdivision 1j, of the State Finance Law, as "the basis for awarding
contracts for services to the offerer which optimizes quality, cost
and efficiency, among responsive and responsible offerers." The
head of the contracting agency shall, before publication of the
request for proposals, prepare and submit to the City Administrator
a written statement detailing the reasons why it is in the best
interests of the City of Beacon and its taxpayers to make an award
on the basis of best value instead of lowest responsible bidder. The
City Administrator shall consider the contracting agency's
submission and shall make a written determination, issued to the
contracting agency, with respect to which standard shall be applied
to the contract under review.
(2) Factors which must be considered by the contracting agency in
awarding a purchase contract on the basis of best value are:
(a) The need for the costlier option as compared with all lower
bids, supported by specific facts;
(b) The cost of the option chosen as compared with all lower bids;
(c) The reputation of the bidder chosen for providing quality goods
or services;
(d) The durability, estimated life and estimated cost of
maintenance of the goods; and
(e) Such other considerations as the City Administrator or
contracting agency shall deem relevant and material to the
letting of the contract.
(3) The bid award shall be accompanied by a written statement
discussing the factors in Subsection B(2) and explaining how the
award is expected to result in savings for the City over time.
Wherever possible, such statements shall also include objective
and quantifiable analyses comparing the bid accepted to all less
expensive options.
§ 53-2 (RESERVED) § 53-3
47:179
§ 53-3. Alternate procedure for letting purchase contracts.
Notwithstanding the provisions of §§ 53-1 and 53-2 of this chapter, any
contracting agency authorized to make purchases of apparatuses,
materials, equipment or supplies, or to contract for services related to the
installation, maintenance or repair of apparatuses, materials, equipment,
and supplies, may make such purchases, or may contract for such services
related to the installation, maintenance or repair of apparatus, materials,
equipment, and supplies, through the use of a contract if said contract was:

City's lasting commitment to all ongoing systematic records programs, and
this is to be a continuing administrative function. It is the responsibility

indicated:
CUSTODY  The control of, and responsibility for, records owned by the
local government, regardless of their location.
RECORD  Any book, paper, map, photograph or other informationrecording
device, regardless of physical form or characteristic, that is

47:187
RECORDS MANAGEMENT OFFICER  The local officer charged with the
responsibility to develop and coordinate the local records management
program in accordance with § 57.19 of the Arts and Cultural Affairs Law.
RECORDS MANAGEMENT PROGRAM  An ongoing, coordinated,
administrative effort to systematically manage a local government's records
from initial creation to final disposition. A records management program
includes but is not limited to: the legal disposition of obsolete records;
the identification and administration of and access to records of enduring
value; filing and indexing systems; the use of computer or other technology
in information creation, manipulation and storage; the storage and
management of inactive records no longer needed for the conduct of dayto-
day business in the office; the microfilming of records; the oversight of
the creation and use of forms, correspondence and other records; and the
provision for protecting vital records.
RECORDS OF ENDURING VALUE (ARCHIVAL RECORDS)  Those records
worthy of permanent retention and special administration because of the
importance of the information they contain for continuing administrative,
legal or fiscal purposes or for historical or other research.

may be disposed of. Guidelines and procedures governing the
disposition of records are listed in State Archives' Records Retention
and Disposition Schedules.
B. Planning for the use of modern technology, including computers and
microfilm, which can be a great benefit to the local government. An

A. The purpose of this chapter is to protect and promote the safety, health
and well-being of the people of the City of Beacon and their property
and to regulate the conduct of persons in the City of Beacon by
prohibiting the consumption of alcoholic beverages in public places and
on property owned or leased by another person without the invitation or
consent of such person.
B. Findings.
(1) The City Council of the City of Beacon finds that the possession or
consumption of alcoholic beverages in public streets and public
places, except under certain conditions, is detrimental to the
health, safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Beacon,
causes unsightly and unsanitary conditions, creates a nuisance and
interferes with the peace and good order of said City. It is further
the intent of the City Council that this chapter not be considered as
a traffic regulation insofar as it relates to motor vehicles or the
operation thereof.
(2) The City Council further finds that the possession or consumption
of alcoholic beverages on public streets and public places is a
serious, substantial and significant cause of persons (especially
persons who are under the legal age for alcoholic consumption)
becoming unruly, disruptive, disorderly, uncontrollable, obnoxious,
offensive and of a general character detrimental to the health,
welfare and peaceful orderliness of the community. In addition, the
allowance of possession or consumption of alcoholic beverages on
public streets and public places has been proven to be a significant
and substantial cause in the congregation of persons who, in turn,
significantly and substantially cause and promote unruly,
disruptive, disorderly, uncontrollable, obnoxious, offensive and
generally detrimental behavior.

§ 79-2. Definitions and word usage.

(3) The City Council further finds that there is a significant relationship
between the possession of an open or unsealed container of an
alcoholic beverage on public streets or places and the general
health, welfare and safety of the public and that it has been
demonstrated to this City Council that the allowance of open or
unsealed containers of alcoholic beverages is the most significant
and substantial factor contributing to the consumption of such
alcoholic beverages.
(4) The City Council further finds that this chapter is necessary and
proper to promote the health, welfare and safety of the general
public and that the restrictions on conduct created by this chapter
are not unduly harsh or restrictive and are necessary and proper
pursuant to the police power of the City of Beacon.

A. This chapter is adopted pursuant to § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule

symmetry, as well as the desirability of surrounding properties and
neighborhood areas for residential, commercial or other permitted land
uses. By so doing, such conditions impair the benefits of occupancy of
existing properties, as well as the stability and value of both improved
and unimproved properties. As a result, they prevent the most
appropriate development and use of such and cause degeneration of
property, with attendant deterioration of conditions affecting the
health, safety and general welfare of the community, and, further, they
destroy the proper relationship between the taxable value of real
property and the cost of municipal services provided therefor in such
areas.
D. It is the purpose of this chapter to prevent these and other harmful
effects of such exterior appearance of buildings erected or altered in
any residential or commercial neighborhood and thus to promote the
health, safety and general welfare of the community, to conserve the
value of buildings and to encourage the most appropriate use of land
within the City.
A. The Chairman of the Planning Board shall schedule meetings of the
Architectural and Community Appearance Board of Review at such time
as the Chairman may designate. A majority of the Board shall constitute
a quorum for the transaction of business. The Board shall keep
stenographic minutes of its proceedings. The Architectural and
Community Appearance Board of Review shall solicit the advice of an
architectural design consultant, where necessary.
B. The applicant may be requested to appear to review with the Board any
submission to it. A report, recommendation or decision made by the
Board of Review must have the approval of the majority of the Board
and shall be officially filed with the City Clerk within 30 days. In the
event that the Board fails to render a decision on an application within
45 days of the meeting at which it was considered, said application shall
be deemed to be approved.
C. The City Council shall, from time to time, set the application fee, by
resolution, for the submission of plans to the Board.

respects to all other applicable laws and ordinances. All applications to the
Planning Board shall be deemed to be simultaneously referred to the Board
of Review, and the approval of the Planning Board shall be deemed to be an
approval of the Board of Review.
§ 86-6. Criteria for recommendations.
A. The Board shall base its recommendations on the following criteria: No
building or structure or land development shall be so detrimental to the
desirability, property values or development of the surrounding area as
to provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth in § 86-2 by
reason of:
(1) The repeated and adjacent use of identical or nearly identical
facades or structures arranged without respect to natural features
of terrain or other existing structures.
(2) Inappropriateness of structure or land development in relation to
any other structure or land development existing or for which a
permit has been issued or to any other structure or land
development included in the same application with respect to one
or more of the following features:
(a) Total volume in cubic feet.
(b) Gross floor area.
(c) Height of the building or height of the roof.
(d) Other significant design features, such as material or quality of
architectural design, roof structures, chimneys, exposed
mechanical equipment and service, service and storage
enclosures, signs, landscaping, retaining walls, parking areas,
service and loading docks, dividing walls, fences, lighting posts
and standards, provided that a finding of inappropriateness
existed to provoke one or more of the harmful effects set forth
in § 86-2.
B. Any person or persons jointly or severally aggrieved by any decision of
the Architectural and Community Appearance Board of Review shall
have the right to review said decision by a public hearing before the
Zoning Board of Appeals and by a proceeding under Article 78 of the

§ 92-1. Legislative intent and findings.
A. Intent. It is the intention of the City of Beacon City Council to promote
the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Beacon by
adopting a local law designed to accomplish the following objectives:
(1) Encourage the owners of vacant buildings to adequately secure
them from vandals, trespassers and children;
(2) Indentify and register vacant buildings to protect residential and
commercial neighborhoods from becoming blighted through lack of
adequate maintenance and security of abandoned buildings; and
(3) Encourage the rehabilitation and reoccupancy of vacant buildings.
B. Findings. The City Council of the City of Beacon finds the following:
(1) The City of Beacon currently has at least 75 vacant buildings within
its jurisdiction.
(2) Vacant buildings and structures are a danger to the public health,
safety and welfare.
(3) Vacant buildings can become a dumping ground for trash, rubbish
and debris, a breeding ground for vermin and a gathering place for
persons engaging in illegal activity.
(4) Vacant buildings in a densely populated or densely developed area,
such as the City of Beacon's downtown commercial district,
increase concerns regarding public health, safety and welfare.
(5) Vacant buildings are frequently the subject of vandalism and are
commonly damaged by fire.
(6) The presence of vacant buildings can lead to blight, decline in
property values, aesthetic nuisances, general decrease in
neighborhood and community aesthetics, and may discourage
buyers from purchasing property within the City.
(7) The City has an interest in protecting the City against decay caused
by vacant buildings and concludes it is in the best interest of the

(4) The failure of any person or owner to receive actual notice of the
determination by the Chief of Police shall not invalidate or

authorize the City Attorney's Office to commence civil proceedings in a
court of competent jurisdiction seeking the closure of the structure as
well as the imposition of civil penalties against any or all of the owners
thereof and any such other relief as may be deemed appropriate.

proceedings for a period of not less than 10 nor more than 60 days. The
owner or the City may thereafter petition the court for such additional
like periods of time as may be necessary to complete the action(s)
contemplated by the stipulation. However, in the event that the City
reasonably believes the owner is not diligently pursuing the action(s)
contemplated by the stipulation, it may then apply to the court for a

or frequenting it shall be admissible as competent.
E. Except in an action brought pursuant to § 94-5B, it is a defense to an
action seeking the closure of a structure that the owner of a structure at
the time in question could not, in the exercise of reasonable care or
diligence, determine that the structure was being used or maintained
as a specified crime property.
F. In establishing the amount of any civil penalty requested, the court may

be appropriate. In such an event, the notification procedures set forth
in § 94-3A and the limitation of § 94-4A need not be complied with.
B. In the event that the Chief of Police determines that a structure is or
has been used as the locale for the manufacture of controlled
substances that involve the use of toxic, flammable or explosive
substances as defined in 49 CFR 172 (1988) and/or processes that, in
the opinion of Police Department or Fire Department personnel,

occupancy for a period of 60 days.

provisions of the chapter.
(3) In the event that the owner fails to comply with the provisions of
Subsection B(2) above, the City may seek an order preventing the
use or occupancy of the structure for such further time as, under
the circumstances, it deems appropriate, unless the owner shows
to the satisfaction of the court that the structure no longer presents
a continuing threat to the public's safety or welfare from the toxic,
flammable or explosive substances and/or processes.
A. In the event that a court finds that a structure constitutes specified
crime property as defined in this chapter, the court may order that it be
closed for any period of up to one year and that the owner(s) pay to the
City a civil penalty of up to $500 for each day the owner had knowledge
of activities or conditions at the structure constituting a violation of this
chapter.
B. The court may also authorize the City to physically secure the structure
against use or occupancy in the event that the owner(s) fail to do so
within the time specified by the court. In the event that the City is
authorized to secure the property, all costs reasonably incurred by the
City to effect a closure shall be made an assessment lien upon the
property. As used in this subsection, "costs" means those costs actually
incurred by the City for the physical securing of the structure, as well
as tenant relocation costs given pursuant to Subsection B(3) of this
section.

statement of costs, and the City shall thereafter submit that
statement to the court for its review. If no objection to the
statement is made within 30 days, a certified copy of the statement,

rate of 9% per year from 10 days after the entry in the lien docket.

or her reasonable relocation costs as those are determined by the

after either:
(a) An owner(s) or agent received notice of the Chief of Police's
determination pursuant to § 94-3A; or
(b) An owner(s) or agent received notice of an action brought
pursuant to § 94-5.

year or for such period as the court directs.
C. They enter into a stipulation with the City that they will immediately
abate the conditions giving rise to the specified crime property and
prevent the same from being established or maintained thereafter. The
stipulation will then be made part of the court's file. In the event that
the owner violates the terms of the stipulation, the City may thereafter
apply to the court for an order awarding up to the entire amount of the
aforementioned bond to the City as a penalty as well as such other
relief, including closure for any additional period of up to one year, that
is deemed by the court as appropriate.

A. "Dangerous dog" is defined as any dog which without justification
attacks a person and causes physical injury or death; or poses a serious
and unjustified imminent threat of harm to one or more persons.
§ 99-9 BEACON CODE § 99-10
95:246
(1) If any dog shall attack any person who is peaceably conducting
himself in any place where he may lawfully be, such person or any
other person witnessing the attack, may destroy such dog while so
attacking or while being pursued thereafter, and no liability in
damages or otherwise shall be incurred on account of such
destruction.
(2) If any dog shall attack, chase or worry any domestic animal, as
hereinafter defined, while such animal is in any place where it may
lawfully be, the owner or caretaker of such domestic animal, or any
other person witnessing such attack may, for the purpose of
preventing the killing or injury of such domestic animal, destroy
such dog while so attacking, chasing, worrying or while being
pursued thereafter, and no liability in damages or otherwise shall
be incurred on account of such destruction. "Domestic animal"
means any domesticated sheep, horse, cattle, fallow deer, red deer,
sika deer, white-tailed deer which is raised under license from the
State Department of Environmental Conservation, llama, goat,
swine, fowl, duck, goose, swan, turkey, confined domestic hare or
rabbit, pheasant or other bird which is raised in confinement under
license from the State Department of Environmental Conservation
before release from captivity, except that the varieties of fowl
commonly used for cock fights shall not be considered domestic
animals for the purposes of this article.
(3) Any person may make a complaint of an attack upon a person or of
an attack, chasing or worrying of a domestic animal to a Dog
Control Officer of the appropriate municipality. Such officer shall
immediately inform the complainant of his right to commence a
proceeding as provided in Subsection A(4) of this section and, if
there is reason to believe the dog is a dangerous dog, the officer
shall forthwith commence such proceeding himself.
(4) Any person may, and any Dog Control Officer as provided in
Subsection A(3) hereof shall, make a complaint under oath or
affirmation to any municipal judge or justice of such attack, chasing
or worrying. Thereupon, the judge or justice shall immediately
determine if there is probable cause to believe the dog is a
dangerous dog, and, if so, shall issue an order to any Dog Control
Officer, peace officer, acting pursuant to his special duties, or police
officer directing such officer to immediately seize such dog and
hold the same pending judicial determination as herein provided.
Whether or not the judge or justice finds there is probable cause for
such seizure, he shall, within five days and upon written notice of
not less than two days to the owner of the dog, hold a hearing on
the complaint. If satisfied that the dog is a dangerous dog, the
judge or justice shall then order any Dog Control Officer, peace
officer, acting pursuant to his special duties, or police officer to
cause the dog to be euthanized immediately, or shall order the
owner to securely confine such dog permanently, except as
§ 99-10 (RESERVED) § 99-10
95:247
provided in Subsection A(6) of this section. The owner shall confine
the dog indoors or in an enclosed and locked pen or structure as
provided for in the order. Such pen or enclosure shall have a secure
top and sides and shall be designed to prevent an unauthorized
entry of a person, the escape of the dog and to provide protection
from the elements. If the owner fails to confine the dog as required
by such order, any Dog Control Officer, peace officer, acting
pursuant to his special duties, or police officer shall destroy such
dog on or off the premises of the owner.
(5) A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the court determines that
the conduct of the dog:
(a) Was justified because the threat, injury or damage was
sustained by a person who at the time was committing a crime
or offense upon the owner or custodian or upon the property of
the owner or custodian of the dog; or
(b) Was justified because the injured person was tormenting,
abusing or assaulting the dog or has in the past tormented,
abused or assaulted the dog; or
(c) Was responding to pain or injury or was protecting itself, its
kennels or its offspring.
(6) Muzzles and other restraints.
(a) In addition to an order of confinement, issued pursuant to
Subsection A(4) of this section, the judge or justice may order
the owner or custodian to securely chain and muzzle the dog
and require that the dog be under physical restraint of a
responsible person when:
[1] Confined in the presence of persons other than the owner
or custodian; and
[2] Outside such enclosure for brief periods only when and for
the period necessary to urinate, defecate or receive
medical treatment.
(b) The muzzle described in Subsection (a) of this subsection shall
be made in a manner that will not cause injury to the dog or
interfere with its vision or respiration but shall prevent it from
biting any person or animal.
(7) Penalties for offenses.
(a) The owner of a dog who, through any act or omission,
negligently permits his or her dog to bite a person, causing
physical injury, shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed
$400, in addition to any other applicable penalties.

(c) The owner of a dog who, through any act or omission,
negligently permits his or her dog, which had previously been
determined to be dangerous pursuant to this article, to bite a
person, causing serious physical injury, shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or
by a period of imprisonment not to exceed 90 days, or by both
such fine and imprisonment, in addition to any other applicable
penalties.
(d) If any dog, which had previously been determined by a judge or
justice to be a dangerous dog, as defined in § 99-10 of this
article, shall without justification kill or cause the death of any
person who is peaceably conducting himself or herself in any
place where he or she may lawfully be, regardless of whether
such dog escapes without fault of the owner, the owner shall be
guilty of a Class A misdemeanor, in addition to any other
penalties.
(8) The owner shall not be liable pursuant to Subsection A(7)(a), (b),
(c) or (d) of this section if the dog was coming to the aid or defense
of a person during the commission or attempted commission of a
murder, robbery, burglary, arson, rape in the first degree, as
defined in Subdivision 1 or 2 of § 130.35 of the Penal Law, sodomy
in the first degree, as defined in Subdivision 1 or 2 of § 130.50 of
the Penal Law, or kidnapping within the dwelling or upon the real
property of the owner of the dog and the dog injured or killed the
person committing such criminal activity.
(9) Nothing contained herein shall limit or abrogate any claim or cause
of action which any person who is injured by a dog with a vicious
disposition or a vicious propensity may have under common law or
by statute. The provisions of this section shall be in addition to such
common law and statutory remedies.
(10) Nothing contained herein shall restrict the rights and powers
derived from the provisions of Title IV of Article 21 of the Public
Health Law relating to rabies and any rule and regulation adopted
pursuant thereto.

determination of facts are made as hereinafter provided.
C. Any dog which poses a threat of serious bodily injury or death to any
person or any domestic animal or which has been trained, tormented,

City Court of the City, which Court shall thereupon cause the owner or
person harboring such dog to be notified, in writing, of the complaint
and to appear before said City Court Judge at a stated time and place.

Court Judge shall decide that such dog complained of is a vicious dog as
defined by this section, notice of such decision shall be given to the
owner or person harboring such dog.
F. No dog which has been so determined to be a vicious dog shall be
permitted to run at large or to be upon any street or public place in the

person harboring any such vicious dog who shall suffer or permit such
dog to be upon any street, public place or private property in the City,
other than the property of the owner or person harboring such dog,
while not securely muzzled and under leash, shall be guilty of a
violation of this chapter.
G. The owner or harborer of a potentially dangerous or vicious dog shall

provided that any animal may be exempt from the requirements of such
inoculation for specified period of time by the Dutchess County

Drug-Free School Zones
[Adopted 2-5-1990 by resolution40]
§ 101-1. Supporting schools.
The Beacon City Council, the Beacon City School District, St. John the
Evangelist School, St. Joachim's School and Beacon Christian Academy
do hereby express their support for the implementation of a Drug-Free
Zone Program, including the installation of appropriate signs around school
grounds.
§ 101-2. Planning and implementation.
The Beacon City Council requests that the Public Works Department
immediately begin the planning and implementation of this program by
consulting with the appropriate City departments and other agencies to
allow for the enforcement of the provisions of the Penal Law and the
imposition of the increased penalty provisions set forth therein upon the
proper creation of these drug-free zones.
40.Editor's Note: The preamble to this resolution read as follows: Whereas, the proliferation
of drugs in our society is recognized as one of the most threatening and dangerous
problems being faced by our youth; and Whereas, the Beacon City Council supports
programs which educate our young people about the dangers of illegal narcotics and
which seek to prevent abuse problems before they get started; and Whereas, the New York
State Division of Substance Abuse Services supports recently enacted legislation which
allows municipalities to, in effect, create drug-free zones in areas frequented by children
by providing for increased penalties for the sale of illegal drugs within 1,000 feet of
school grounds; and Whereas, such drug-free zones are intended to create a zone of safety
for school children and to give moral support to young people who want to resist the use
of illegal drugs; and Whereas, the effective application of this program would require the
cooperation of a variety of government agencies including the police, the courts, the
district attorney, and the public and private school systems, now therefore, be it...

ARTICLE II
Community Choice Aggregation
[Adopted 1-17-2017 by L.L. No. 1-2017]

§ 106-11. Definitions.
For purposes of this article, and unless otherwise expressly stated or unless
the context otherwise requires, the terms in this article shall have the
A. It is the policy of both the City of Beacon and the State of York to reduce
costs and provide price certainty for the purpose of consumer
protection and economic development, to expand access and
opportunities for consumers in retail energy markets, as well as to
promote the sustainability and resilience of energy systems through the
proliferation of renewable energy, energy efficiency, and distributed
energy resources (DER, as defined below). Among the initiatives that
may advance these objectives in New York is community choice
aggregation (CCA), a policy that empowers local governments to
determine the source of electricity and/or natural gas supply on behalf
of its residents and small businesses, reflecting local resources,
priorities, and challenges. Energy delivery remains the responsibility of
the distribution utility.
B. This article establishes the authority for the City of Beacon, in
connection with the implementation of a CCA program, to acquire
utility data, to select, through competitive solicitation, energy
supplier(s) on behalf of default consumers within the jurisdictional
boundaries of the City of Beacon, and to maximize value for
participating consumers through enhanced services related to DER.
The municipality may choose to collaborate with other local
governments to form an intermunicipal program. As a result,
consumers will have the opportunity to lower and stabilize their energy
costs, to spur local clean energy innovation and investment, and to
reduce their environmental impact; thereby, fulfilling the purposes of
this article and fulfilling an important public purpose.
C. The City of Beacon is authorized to implement this community choice
aggregation program pursuant to § 10(1)(ii)(a)(12) of the New York
Municipal Home Rule Law; and consistent with State of New York
Public Service Commission Case No. 14-M-0224, Proceeding on Motion
of the Commission to Enable Community Choice Aggregation Programs
(issued April 21, 2017) as may be amended, including subsequent
orders of the Public Service Commission issued in connection with or
related to Case No. 14-M-0224, to the extent that orders related to Case
No. 14-M-0224 enable actions by the municipality.
D. This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Community Choice
Aggregation Program Law of the City of Beacon."

becomes a lien. Each Annual Installment Lien shall be subordinate to all
Municipal Liens, whether created by Section 902 of the RPTL or by any
other state or local law. No portion of a Secured Amount shall be
recovered by the City of Beacon, EIC or an assignee upon foreclosure,
sale or other disposition of the Benefited Property unless and until all
Municipal Liens are fully discharged. Each Annual Installment Lien,
however, shall have priority over all Non-Municipal Liens, irrespective
of when created, except as otherwise required by law.
§ 106-26 BEACON CODE § 106-27
101:302
§ 106-28. Verification and report.
EIC, on behalf of the City of Beacon, shall verify and report on the
installation and performance of Renewable Energy Systems and Energy
Efficiency Improvements financed by the Program in such form and manner
as the Authority may establish.
D. Neither the Benefit Assessment Lien nor any Annual Installment Lien
shall be extinguished or accelerated in the event of a default or
bankruptcy of the Benefited Property Owner. Each Annual Installment
Amount shall be considered a charge upon the Benefited Property and
shall be collected by EIC, on behalf of the City of Beacon, at the same
time and in the same manner as real property taxes or municipal
charges. Each Annual Installment Lien shall remain a lien until paid.
Amounts collected in respect of an Annual Installment Lien shall be
remitted to EIC, on behalf of the City of Beacon, or the Financing Party,
as may be provided in the Finance Agreement.
E. EIC shall act as the City of Beacon's agent in collection of the Annual
Installment Amounts. If any Benefited Property Owner fails to pay an
Annual Installment Amount, the Financing Party may redeem the
Benefited Property by paying the amount of all unpaid Municipal Liens
thereon, and thereafter shall have the right to collect any amounts in
respect of an Annual Installment Lien by foreclosure or any other
remedy available at law. Any foreclosure shall not affect any subsequent
Annual Installment Liens.
F. EIC, on behalf of the City of Beacon, may sell or assign for consideration
any and all Benefit Assessment Liens and Annual Installment Liens to
Financing Parties that provide financing to Qualified Properties
pursuant to Finance Agreements. The Financing Parties may sell or
assign for consideration any and all Benefit Assessment Liens and
Annual Installment Liens received from EIC, on behalf of the City of
Beacon, subject to certain conditions provided in the administration
agreement between EIC and the Financing Party. The assignee or
assignees of such Benefit Assessment Liens and Annual Installment
Liens shall have and possess the same powers and rights at law or in
equity as the City of Beacon would have had if the Benefit Assessment
Lien and the Annual Installment Liens had not been assigned with
regard to the precedence and priority of such lien, the accrual of
interest and the fees and expenses of collection.

D.
Except as set forth in § 107-11 herein, actions undertaken or approved
prior to the effective dates of this chapter. An action shall be deemed
to be undertaken or approved prior to such dates if, in the case of
construction activities, a contract for substantial construction activities
has been entered into or if a continuous program of on-site construction
or modification has been engaged in or if, in the case of an action
involving federal participation, either a draft environmental impact

G. Actions of any court.
A. No decision to carry out or approve an action other than a Type II
action, as set forth in §§ 107-6 and 107-15 herein, shall be made by an
agency until there has been full compliance with all requirements of
this chapter; provided, however, that nothing herein shall be construed
as prohibiting:
(1) The conducting of contemporaneous environmental, engineering,
economic feasibility or other studies and preliminary planning and
budgetary processes necessary to the formulation of a proposal for
action which do not commit the agency to approve, commence or
engage in such action; or
(2) The granting of any part of an application which relates only to
technical specifications and requirements, provided that no such
§ 107-4 BEACON CODE § 107-5
107:306
§ 107-6. Actions requiring an EIS.
partial approval shall entitle or permit the applicant to commence
the action until all requirements of this chapter have been fulfilled.
B. Agencies may identify programs or categories of actions which could
most appropriately be covered by a single environmental impact
statement. Statements for comprehensive plans are often appropriate
to assess the environmental effects of:
(1) A number of separate actions in a given geographic area.
(2) A chain of contemplated actions.
(3) Separate actions having generic or common impacts.
(4) Programs or plans having wide application or restricting the range
of future alternative policies or projects.
C. Such statements will eliminate multiple sequential reviews of the same
or similar actions. No further environmental impact statements need be
prepared for actions which are included in such a statement. Agencies
preparing such a statement shall develop procedures for amending or
supplementing such statements to reflect impacts which are not
addressed or adequately analyzed in such a statement as initially
prepared. Such procedures shall include provision for informing the
public and other agencies of the preparation of such amendments or
supplements and for allowing comment thereon before incorporation of
such amendments or supplements into said statement.
A. To simplify the task of determining whether or not a proposed action
may have a significant effect on the environment, actions are divided
into three classes, Type I, Type II and Type III.
(1) Type I actions or classes of actions are likely to, but will not
necessarily, require preparation of environmental impact
statements because they will in almost every instance have a
significant effect on the environment. Type I actions are listed on
the environmental clearance form in § 107-15 herein.
(2) Type II actions or classes of actions have been determined not to
have a significant effect on the environment and do not require
environmental impact statements. Type II actions are listed on the
environmental clearance form in § 107-15 herein.
(3) Type III actions or classes of actions are actions which are neither
Type I nor Type II and which may have a significant effect on the
environment if they can reasonably be expected, by the agency, to
lead to one of the following consequences:
(a) A substantial adverse change to ambient air or water quality or
noise levels or in solid waste production, drainage, erosion or
flooding.
§ 107-5 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 107-6
107:307
(b) The removal or destruction of large quantities of flora or fauna,
the substantial interference with the movement of any resident
or migratory fish or wildlife species, impacts on critical habitat
areas or the substantial affecting of a rare or endangered
species of animal or plant or the habitat of such a species.
(c) The encouragement or attraction of a large number of people
to a place or places for more than a few days relative to the
number of people who would come to such place absent the
action.
(d) The creation of a material conflict with a community's existing
plans or goals as officially approved or adopted.
(e) The impairment of the character or quality of important
historical, archaeological, architectural or aesthetic resources
or of the existing community or neighborhood character.
(f) A substantial change in the use of either the quantity or type of
energy.
(g) The creation of a hazard to human health or safety.
(h) A substantial change in the use or intensity of use of land or
other natural resources or in the capacity of land or other
natural resources to support uses.
(i) The creation of a material demand for other actions which
would result in one of the above consequences.
(j) Changes in two or more elements of the environment, no one of
which is substantial, but when taken together result in a
material change in the environment.
B. For the purpose of determining whether an action will cause one of the
foregoing consequences, the action shall be deemed to include other
contemporaneous or subsequent actions which:
(1) Are included in any long-range comprehensive integrated plan of
which the action under consideration is a part;
(2) Are likely to be undertaken as a result thereof; or
(3) Are dependent thereon.
C. The significance of a likely consequence should be assessed in
connection with its setting, its probability of occurrence, its duration,
its irreversibility, its controllability, its geographic scope and its
magnitude. Section 107-15 herein contains forms which an agency may
wholly or partly use and an applicant shall use to aid in determining
whether or not a Type III action will have a significant effect on the
environment.
§ 107-6 BEACON CODE § 107-7
107:308
§ 107-7. Contents of an EIS.
A. Within the framework presented in Subsection D herein, environmental
impact statements should deal only with the specific significant
environmental impacts which can be reasonably anticipated. They
should not contain more detail than is appropriate considering the
nature and magnitude of the proposed action, the significance of its
potential impacts and the existing resources and capability of the
agency responsible for the statement. An agency may require that an
EIS be prepared by a duly qualified professional.
B. All draft and final environmental impact statements shall be preceded
by a cover sheet stating:
(1) Whether it is a draft or final.
(2) The name or other descriptive title of the action.
(3) The location of the action, including the name of this City.
(4) The name and address of the agency which required its preparation
and the name and telephone number of a person at the agency to
be contacted for further information.
(5) Identification of the individuals or organizations who prepared any
portion of the statement.
(6) The date of its completion.
C. If a draft or final environmental impact statement exceeds 10 pages in
length, it shall have a table of contents following the cover sheet.
D. The body of all draft and final environmental impact statements shall at
least contain the following:
(1) A description of the proposed action and its environmental setting.
(2) A statement of the environmental impact of the proposed action,
including its short- and long-term effects, and typical associated
environmental effects.
(3) An identification of any adverse environmental effects which
cannot be avoided if the proposed action is implemented.
(4) A discussion of alternatives to the proposed action and the
comparable impacts and effects of such alternatives.
(5) An identification of any irreversible and irretrievable commitments
of resources which would be involved in the proposed action should
it be implemented.
(6) A description of mitigation measures proposed to minimize the
adverse environmental impacts.
§ 107-7 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 107-7
107:309
§ 107-8. Procedure.
(7) A description of any growth-inducing aspects of the proposed
action.
(8) A discussion of the effects of the proposed action on the use and
conservation of energy.
(9) A list of any underlying studies, reports and other information
obtained and considered by the agency in preparing the statement.
(10) For final environmental impact statements, copies or a summary of
the substantive comments received in response to the draft
environmental impact statement and the agency's response to such
comments.
E. An environmental impact statement may incorporate by reference all or
portions of other documents which contain information relevant to the
statement. The referenced document shall be made available to the
public at the City Clerk's office in the City Hall. When a statement uses
incorporation by reference, the referenced document shall be briefly
described and its date of preparation provided.
A. Application. An agency considering an action or an applicant requesting
approval by an agency shall complete the environmental clearance form
contained in § 107-15 herein. An applicant shall present this form to the
agency whose approval is being sought, accompanied by a fee as set
forth in § 107-12 herein.
B. Determination of need for an EIS.
(1) In cases where an applicant is involved, the agency shall render a
written determination within 15 days following receipt of a
complete application, except as provided in § 107-9 herein;
provided, however, that such period may be extended by mutual
agreement of the applicant and the agency. The determination shall
state whether the proposed action is:
(a) An exempt action.
(b) A Type II action.
(c) A Type I or Type III action which will not have a significant
effect on the environment.
(d) A Type I or Type III action which may have a significant effect
on the environment.
(2) The agency may meet with the applicant and meet and consult with
any other person for the purpose of aiding it in making the
determination.
§ 107-7 BEACON CODE § 107-8
107:310
(3) In the case of a Type I or Type III action, the agency shall circulate

Type II action or will not have a significant effect on the
environment, the proposed action may be processed without
further regard to this chapter.
(5) Following a determination that a proposed action may have a
significant effect on the environment, the agency shall prepare a
draft environmental impact statement or, in the case of an action
involving an applicant, may request the applicant to prepare an
environmental impact report in the form of a draft environmental
impact statement. If the applicant decides not to submit an
environmental impact report, the agency shall prepare or cause to
be prepared the draft environmental impact statement or, in its
discretion, notify the applicant that the processing of the
application will cease and that no approval will be issued. The
applicant shall submit a fee, in accordance with § 107-12 herein, to
defray the expense to the agency of preparing and/or reviewing the
draft environmental impact statement.
C. Notice of completion.
(1) Upon completion of a draft environmental impact statement, a
notice of completion shall be prepared, which shall contain the
following:
(a) A brief description of the action covered by the statement and
the location of its potential impacts and effects.
(b) A statement indicating where and how copies of the statement
can be obtained from the agency.
(c) A statement that comments on the DEIS are requested and will
be received and considered by the agency at a given address
for a period of not less than 30 calendar days from the date of

York 12561.
(c) To the Commissioner, New York State Department of
Environmental Conservation, 50 Wolf Road, Albany, New York
12233.
D. Public hearing. If the agency, at its discretion, decides to hold a public
hearing on a draft environmental impact statement, notice thereof shall
be circulated in the same manner as the notice of completion and shall
be published in the official newspaper at least 10 days prior to such
public hearing. Such notice shall also state the place where substantive
written comments on the draft environmental impact statement may be
sent and the date by which such comments must be received. The
hearing shall commence no less than 15 calendar days nor more than
60 calendar days from the date of the filing of the DEIS, except as
otherwise provided where the agency determines that additional time is
necessary for the public or some other agency to review the DEIS or
where a different hearing date is required as appropriate under other
applicable law.
E. Analysis of the DEIS. If, on the basis of a draft environmental impact
statement or a public hearing thereon, the agency determines that an
action will not have significant effect on the environment, the proposed
action may be processed without further regard to this chapter.
F. Final EIS. If the agency determines that an action may have a
significant effect on the environment, the agency shall prepare or cause
§ 107-8 BEACON CODE § 107-8
107:312
§ 107-9. Actions involving more than one agency.
to be prepared a final environmental impact statement. If the action
involves an application, the agency may direct the applicant to prepare
the final EIS. Such final EIS shall be prepared within 45 days after
the close of any hearing or within 60 days after the filing of the
draft environmental impact statement, whichever last occurs: provided,
however, that the agency may extend this time as necessary to complete
the statement adequately or where problems identified with the
proposed action require material reconsideration or modification or
where mutually agreed to by the applicant and the agency. Where the
action involves an application, such final EIS shall be accompanied by a
fee, in accordance with § 107-12 herein.
G. Notice of completion. A notice of completion of a final EIS shall be
prepared. Copies of this notice and copies of the final EIS shall be
circulated in the same manner as provided in Subsection C herein.
H. Approval/disapproval of action.
(1) No decision to carry out or approve an action which has been the
subject of a final environmental impact statement shall be made
until after the filing and consideration of such final EIS. Where the
agency has been the lead agency for an action, it shall make a
decision whether or not to approve the action within 30 days of the
date of filing of the final EIS.
(2) An agency shall not carry out or approve an action which may have
a significant effect on the environment unless it determines, in
writing, that:
(a) Consistent with social, economic and other essential
considerations of City policy, to the maximum extent
practicable, from among the reasonable alternatives thereto,
the action to be carried out or approved is one which minimizes
or avoids adverse environmental effects, including the effects
disclosed in the EIS; and
(b) All practicable means will be taken in carrying out or
approving the action to minimize or avoid adverse
environmental effects.
(3) For public information purposes, copies of the determination shall
be circulated as provided in Subsection C(2) and (3) herein.
A. When an action which may have a significant effect on the environment
involves the decision or approval of more than one agency, all involved
agencies shall, to the fullest extent possible, coordinate their
environmental reviews through a lead agency to the end that the
requirements of this chapter are met by a single draft environmental
impact statement, a single final environmental impact statement and a
single hearing process. In order to expedite this coordination, agencies
§ 107-8 ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY REVIEW § 107-9
107:313
shall require applicants to specify in their applications which other
agencies, to the best of their knowledge, will have jurisdiction over the
proposed action.
B. Upon receipt of a complete application for an action which an agency
determines may have a significant effect on the environment, the
agency shall immediately notify all other agencies which may be
involved in the proposed action and request full coordination of the
environmental review of such action. The designation of the lead
agency shall be made by mutual agreement between the agencies
within 30 calendar days following the filing of a complete application.
C. If a question arises between or among two or more agencies as to which
agency is the lead agency, the agencies shall resolve the question
themselves and designate a lead agency in writing on the basis of the
following:
(1) The agency to first act on the proposed action.
(2) A determination of which agency has the greatest responsibility for
supervising or approving the action as a whole.
(3) A determination of which agency has more general governmental
powers as compared to single or limited powers or purposes.
(4) A determination of which agency has the greatest capacity for
providing the most thorough environmental assessment of the
action.
(5) A determination of whether the anticipated impacts of the action
being considered are primarily of statewide, regional or local
concern, e.g., if such impacts are primarily of local concern, the
local agency should be the lead agency.
D. If such agencies are unable to resolve the question within the
prescribed thirty-calendar-day period, they shall:
(1) Where the agencies are all agencies of the City of Beacon, submit
the question to the City Council for its determination; or
(2) Where nonlocal agencies are involved, submit the question in
written form to the Commissioner of the Department of
Environmental Conservation who shall, within five business days,
on the basis of the criteria specified above, designate the lead
agency.
E. In the case of an action involving an applicant, the lead agency shall
immediately notify the applicant in writing that it is the lead agency and
may request the applicant to prepare the draft EIS or do so itself.
F. The other agencies involved in the action shall have no further
obligations under this chapter with respect to the action being
considered, except:
§ 107-9 BEACON CODE § 107-9
107:314
§ 107-10. Actions involving federal participation.
§ 107-11. Prior actions.
Actions undertaken or approved prior to the effective dates of this chapter
shall be exempt actions; provided, however, that if after such dates an
agency modifies an action undertaken or approved prior to that date and
the agency determines that the modification may have a significant adverse
effect on the environment, such modification shall be an action subject to
this chapter.
§ 107-12. Fees.
(1) To provide their views, where appropriate and to the extent
practical, appropriate technical analysis and support.
(2) To make the findings required by § 107-8H(2) herein.
(3) Not to approve, commence or engage in such action until the
procedures set forth in § 107-8 herein have been completed and the
action has been approved by the lead agency.
A. Where there has been duly prepared under the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 both a draft environmental impact statement and a
final environmental impact statement for an action under
consideration, the agency shall have no obligation to prepare an
environmental impact statement or make findings under this chapter
with respect to the action so long as the environmental impact
statements either contain or are supplemented by the items concerning
growth-inducing aspects and energy use and conservation listed in
§ 107-7D(7) and (8) herein.
B. Where there has been duly prepared under the National Environmental
Policy Act of 1969 a negative declaration or other written determination
that the action will not require a federal impact statement, the agency
shall determine whether or not the action may have a significant effect
on the environment pursuant to this chapter.
A. When a Type I or Type III action involves an applicant, the agency may
charge fees in order to recover the costs incurred in preparing or
causing to be prepared or reviewing an environmental impact
statement regarding the action.
B. The fees may be in cash or, at the discretion of the agency and subject
to the approval of the City Attorney as to form and sufficiency, in the
form of a bond.
C. The fees shall be as follows:
(1) Accompanying a preliminary environmental assessment form: $50,
to be submitted at the time of application, as set forth in § 107-8A
herein.

The agency shall maintain files, which shall be open for public inspection, of
all notices of completion, draft and final environmental impact statements
and the written determinations resulting therefrom.
§ 107-14. Effective dates.
As provided by § 8-0117 of Article 8 of the Environmental Conservation Law,
the provisions of this chapter shall take effect June 1, 1977, as pertains to
actions directly undertaken by agencies, and shall take effect September
1, 1977, as pertains to actions requiring permits or other approvals from
agencies.

assessment forms.
An agency may wholly or partly use and an applicant shall use the following
forms to aid in determining whether an action is Type I, II or III and whether
it will have significant effect on the environment.49

application, the City Administrator shall consider the following factors:
(1) Potential traffic congestion caused by vehicles or equipment to be
kept on the public street;
(2) The applicant's ability to remove film-related vehicles and
equipment off the public streets in between filming;
(3) The time(s) of day during which the applicant is requesting
restrictions on the use of public streets or public parking during the
course of the filming;
(4) The nature of the film shoot itself, i.e., indoor or outdoor, day or
night, or on public or private lands; and
(5) Prior experience the City has in dealing with the film company/

§ 117-16. Adherence to other laws.
Notwithstanding the issuance of a permit pursuant to this chapter, all
filming in the City shall be conducted in accordance with all applicable City
ordinances and federal and state laws.
§ 117-17. Penalties for offenses.
§ 117-18. Previous violations.
Notwithstanding any of the foregoing, the City Administrator may deny a
permit to an applicant who has been previously convicted of a violation of
this chapter within 18 months from the date of conviction.
C. Upon written request by the applicant, the City Administrator may, in
his/her sole discretion, authorize the placement, operation or storage of
any sets, equipment, staging areas or vehicles used in connection with
the filming at times other than during the otherwise permitted hours for
filming stated in Subsection A herein. In rendering its determination,
the City Administrator shall consider the factors set forth in § 117-15B.

hindrance to the performance of public duties, therefore requiring a
permit pursuant to this chapter.

made to City-owned or -operated real property in connection with
permitted filming, including, without limitation, trimming of trees or
plants, digging of holes, or modification of structures, unless done with
the express, written consent of the City Administrator. The City
Administrator may impose additional fees on a permit-holder for such
alterations.
A. Any person, persons, corporation, company, group or other entity of any
kind who or which fails to obtain the permit required herein, or
otherwise violates any provision of this chapter, shall be guilty of an
offense which shall be punishable by a fine of not more than $350 per
offense or by imprisonment not exceeding 15 days, or both.
B. The imposition of such fine shall not be the City's exclusive remedy in
the event of a violation of this chapter, and the City may pursue any and
all other legal remedies available in connection with any violation of

administration and enforcement of the Uniform Code.
A. Compliance orders. The Code Enforcement Officer is authorized to
order, in writing, the remedying of any condition or activity found to
exist in, on or about any building, structure, or premises in violation of
the Uniform Code, the Energy Code or this chapter. Upon finding that
any such condition or activity exists, the Code Enforcement Officer shall
issue a compliance order. The compliance order shall be in writing; be
dated and signed by the Code Enforcement Officer; specify the
condition or activity that violates the Uniform Code, the Energy Code,
or this chapter; and specify the provision or provisions of the Uniform
Code, the Energy Code, or this chapter which is/are violated by the
specified condition or activity. If the compliance order refers to a
§ 119-13 BEACON CODE § 119-15
111:346
violation of the Uniform Code, it must direct that full compliance be
achieved within 30 days after the date of the order, or such other time
as may be promulgated by the New York State Department of State, and
specify the date for full compliance. Although the order for a violation
of the Uniform Code requires full compliance within 30 days, the City
may order the person or entity in violation to begin to remedy the
violation(s) immediately or within some other stated period of time less
than 30 days after the date of the order. In a compliance order for a
violation of the Uniform Code, the Code Enforcement Officer may also
require other protective actions as the Code Enforcement Officer may
deem appropriate while such violations are being remedied.
B. Service. The Code Enforcement Officer shall cause the compliance
order for a violation of the Uniform Code, or a copy thereof, to be served
on the person or entity in violation personally or by certified or
registered mail within five days of the date of the order. A compliance
order for violations of the Uniform Code shall be deemed served on the
date it is mailed by certified or registered mail. The Code Enforcement
Officer shall be permitted, but not required, to cause a compliance
order for violations that are not under the Uniform Code, or a copy
thereof, to be served on any builder, architect, tenant, contractor,
subcontractor, construction superintendent, or their agents, or any
other person taking part or assisting in work being performed at the
affected property personally or by certified mail; provided, however,
that failure to serve any person mentioned in this sentence shall not
affect the efficacy of the compliance order.
C. Appearance tickets. The Code Enforcement Officer and each inspector
are authorized to issue appearance tickets for any violation of the
Uniform Code.
D. Civil penalties. In addition to those penalties prescribed by state law,
any person who violates any provision of the Uniform Code, the Energy
Code or this chapter, or any term or condition of any building permit,
certificate of compliance, temporary certificate, stop-work order,
operating permit or other notice or order issued by the Code
Enforcement Officer pursuant to any provision of this chapter, shall be

thereof during which such violation continues. The civil penalties
provided by this subsection shall be recoverable in an action instituted
in the name of this City.

of this City, in a court of competent jurisdiction, to prevent, restrain,
enjoin, correct, or abate any violation of, or to enforce any provision of
the Uniform Code, the Energy Code, this chapter, or any term or
condition of any building permit, certificate of occupancy/certificate of
compliance, temporary certificate, stop-work order, operating permit,
compliance order, or other notice or order issued by the Code
Enforcement Officer pursuant to any provision of this chapter. In

commenced in the name of this City, in the Supreme Court or in
any other court having the requisite jurisdiction, to obtain an order
directing the removal of the building or structure or an abatement of
the condition in violation of such provisions.
F. Remedies not exclusive. No remedy or penalty specified in this section
shall be the exclusive remedy or penalty available to address any
violation described in this section, and each remedy or penalty specified
in this section shall be in addition to, and not in substitution for or
limitation of, the other remedies or penalties specified in this section, in

Chapter 120
E-911
§ 120-1. Title.
This chapter shall be titled "A Local Law Creating Chapter 120 of the City
of Beacon Code titled `E-911 Law.'"
§ 120-2. Purpose.
§ 120-3. Legislative intent.
The Dutchess County Legislature has previously determined that it is in
the best interest of the citizens of the County of Dutchess to have uniform
signs for E-911 purposes so that all structures in the County can be easily
identified by emergency vehicles. In addition thereto, the City of Beacon
strongly feels that each citizen has the responsibility of affixing his/her
E-911 number once that number has been received. There must be
cooperation among the citizens, government, and the emergency service
providers in order for the E-911 system to operate as designed.
§ 120-4. Numbering of houses and structures.
Within 60 days after receipt of written notification of address or new
address assignment, the owner or occupant shall affix/display the assigned
address number as described herein.
A. The County of Dutchess has enacted a law titled "Dutchess County
E-911 Sign Law."
B. That law sets forth a procedure on noncompliance which authorizes a
local municipality to enforce the provisions of said law.
C. The City of Beacon by this chapter enacts the provisions of the Dutchess
County Law as Chapter 120 of the Beacon City Code titled "E-911" as
follows.
A. The property owner of record has the responsibility to affix the E-911
number as described in Subsections B and C. After the E-911 number
has been affixed, the property owner of record shall remove the
previous number that had been assigned to the property. The costs
§ 119-17 E-911 § 120-4
120:349
§ 120-5. Road name signs.
involved in affixing the E-911 number and removing the previous
number shall be borne by the property owner of record.
B. Size and location of road address numbers. Road address numbers for
residences shall not be less than three inches in height and shall be
made of a durable and clearly visible material. In addition, the material
should be reflective, if possible. Whenever a building is more than 50
feet from the road or when the entrance of the building is not visible
from the road, the numbers shall be placed on a rigid post along a walk,
driveway, or other location so that the address number is visible from
the road, upon approach from any direction. Address numbers shall be
of a contrasting color of the background on which they are mounted. A
mailbox at the end of the walk or driveway with numbers on both sides
of it can be used in lieu of the rigid post. A second set of numbers shall
be placed on a structure located more than 50 feet from the road.
C. Display of address numbers. All commercial and industrial structures
shall display address numbers of not less than four inches in height as
follows:
(1) When possible, the numbers shall be displayed over the main
entrance to the structure.
(2) Apartments, townhouses, shopping centers or other similar groups,
where only one number is assigned, shall display such number at
the main entranceway. Numbers for individual units or
establishments within the complex shall be displayed on, above, or
to the side of the main doorway of each unit, apartment, suite or
establishment.
A. Location of road name signs. A street sign of standard design, as
approved by the City, shall be erected on metal poles or such other
material as approved by the City at each intersection of public roads
within the City. At least one road name sign displaying the name of each
road shall be erected and maintained. Whenever possible, road name
signs shall be located in the right-hand corner of the intersection on the
approach side from a major thoroughfare. When this is not possible,
road name signs shall be located in the next most suitable corner as
determined by the City. Signs shall be visible from both directions and
shall be properly maintained.
B. Erection and fee for public roads. At the request of a developer and
upon receipt of a fee sufficient to cover the cost of materials and labor,
as determined by the City, the City shall fabricate and erect road name
signs at the intersection of new roads. The fee shall be paid at the time
the final plat is submitted. The City may specify that all street name
signs be erected at the commencement of construction of said road.
However, should the developer request that road name signs be erected
prior to the new street being accepted by the City, the developer shall
§ 120-4 BEACON CODE § 120-5
120:350
§ 120-6. Procedure on noncompliance.
be responsible for their maintenance until such time as the streets
are accepted by the City. Prior to the City accepting a new road, the
municipality's engineer or designated agent shall make an inspection to
determine that all road name signs are in a state of good maintenance.
Should any road name sign be missing or in need of repair, the
developer shall pay the full cost for replacement and/or repair thereof.
It is the responsibility of the City to erect and maintain each signpost.
C. Erection and fee for private roads. Erection and maintenance of road
signs shall be required of the owner or majority of owners of any private
road. At the request of the owner or majority of owners of a private
road, and upon receipt of a fee sufficient to cover the cost of materials
and labor as determined by the City, the City may fabricate, erect, and
thereafter maintain a road name sign at the intersection of the private
road and any public street. The erection of the road name signs shall be
done according to National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
standards.
A. Any owner of a structure within the City of Beacon who refuses or
neglects to properly number said structure as outlined in § 120-4 or pay
the fee for a private road sign outlined in § 120-5C shall be deemed in
violation of this chapter. Said owner shall be notified of the violation of
this chapter.
B. Service of notice. The notice provided for in Subsection A may be given
by personal service or by mailing a copy, certified mail, return receipt
requested, thereof to the last known address of the owner.
C. The City shall authorize the enforcement of the provisions of this
chapter by designating the appointment of the Building Department for
the service of notices, issuance of summonses, prosecution of
violations, and collection of fines herein. All fines shall be paid to the
financial officer of the City and retained by the City for general
purposes.
D. Upon discovery of a violation of this chapter, the Building Department
shall give notice of such violation by providing notice as set forth
herein. The owner shall have 30 days within which to comply. Failure to
comply 30 days after allows the Building Department to issue a
summons to the last known owner of the premises directing that person
as a respondent to show cause before the City Administrator at a stated
time and place why said person should not be declared in violation of
this chapter and fined in accordance herewith.
E. The respondent, at said time and place, shall present any evidence in
defense of his or her position or may show particular circumstances or
hardship for which he or she may be entitled to additional time to
comply or, due to unusual hardship, may be entitled to a variance in the
application of this chapter.
§ 120-5 E-911 § 120-6
120:351
§ 120-7. Penalties for offenses.
Any violation of this chapter shall constitute an offense punishable by a
fine not exceeding $50 for a first offense, not exceeding $100 for a second
offense, and not exceeding $150 for any subsequent offense.
§ 120-8. Appeals.
F. The City Administrator shall, after considering all the facts, make a
determination forthwith:
(1) Holding the owner is in violation and imposing a fine in accordance
with § 120-7 herein;
(2) Extending the owner additional time within which to comply;
(3) Granting a variance from the strict application of this chapter; or
(4) Dismissing the summons on the basis of the defense submitted.
A. There is hereby created the City of Beacon E-911 Appeals Panel,
consisting of three members, who shall be appointed by the Mayor
subject to Council approval. The term of each panel member shall be for
three years.
B. Any owner may challenge the City Administrator determination by filing
an appeal with the City of Beacon E-911 Appeals Panel (Appeals Panel)
within 30 days of receipt of said determination. Said appeal shall be in
writing and shall be limited to the issues before said City Administrator.
The Appeals Panel shall permit the owner the opportunity to appear
before it at a public meeting and to present information orally and in
writing which supports the position of said party.
C. The Appeals Panel shall, after due deliberation, and within 60 days of
receipt of the appeal, make a determination:
(1) Affirming the determination of the City Administrator;
(2) Modifying the determination of the City Administrator by granting
a variance to said owner; or
(3) Reversing the determination of the City Administrator.
D. It is the intent of the Council that this Appeals Panel be in effect for
three years from the date of initial passage of this legislation on January
7, 2002. After three years from that date the Appeals Panel will be
disbanded. Should there be an appeal filed thereafter, the City Council
shall serve as the appeals board to hear and determine any subsequent
appeals.
§ 120-6 BEACON CODE § 120-9
120:352
§ 120-9. Enforcement.
Any fine levied through the process in § 120-8, Appeals, shall be paid within
30 days of receipt of notice from the City Administrator or within 30 days of
receipt of the final determination of the Appeals Panel on an appeal. Upon
the failure of an owner/applicant to pay the fine within the time provided,
the City Administrator shall levy the fine with the next tax bill. The total
amount due shall become a lien against the parcel and may be assessed
against the same on the City tax roll, if not paid in full by October 1 of each
year.

§ 123-1. Findings.
The City Council of the City of Beacon finds that the potential and/or actual
damages from flooding and erosion may be a problem to the residents of
the City and that such damages may include destruction or loss of private
and public housing, damage to public facilities, both publicly and privately
owned, and injury to and loss of human life. In order to minimize the threat
of such damages and to achieve the purposes and objectives hereinafter set
forth, this chapter is adopted.
§ 123-2. Statement of purpose.
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and
general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
A. Regulate uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due
to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in
erosion or in flood heights or velocities;
B. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve
such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial
construction;
C. Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and
natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of
floodwaters;

§ 123-11. Designation of local administrator.
The Building Inspector is hereby appointed local administrator to
administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying floodplain
development permits in accordance with its provisions.
§ 123-12. Floodplain development permit.
A. Purpose. A floodplain development permit is hereby established for all
construction and other development to be undertaken in areas of
special flood hazard in this community for the purpose of protecting its
citizens from increased flood hazards and insuring that new
development is constructed in a manner that minimizes its exposure to
flooding. It shall be unlawful to undertake any development in an area
of special flood hazard, as shown on the Flood Insurance Rate Map
enumerated in § 123-6, without a valid floodplain development permit.
Application for a permit shall be made on forms furnished by the local
administrator and may include, but not be limited to; plans, in
duplicate, drawn to scale and showing the nature, location, dimensions,
and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures,
fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities, and the location of the
foregoing.
B. Fees. All applications for a floodplain development permit shall be
accompanied by an application fee in an amount established by the City
Council in the City of Beacon Schedule of Fees. In addition, the
applicant shall be responsible for reimbursing the City of Beacon for
any additional costs necessary for review, inspection and approval of
this project. The local administrator may require a deposit of $1,000 or
such other reasonable amount as determined by the local administrator
to cover these additional costs. No permit, certificate of occupancy or
certificate of completion shall be issued until all additional costs
incurred in connection with the review, inspection or approval of the
project are paid in full.
C. Application for permit. The applicant shall provide the following
information as appropriate. Additional information may be required on
the permit application form.
§ 123-10 E-911 § 123-12

floor (including basement or cellar) of any new or substantially
improved structure to be located in Zones A1-A30, AE or AH, or
Zone A if base flood elevation data are available. Upon completion
of the lowest floor, the permittee shall submit to the local
administrator the as-built elevation, certified by a licensed
professional engineer or surveyor.
(2) The proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, to which any
new or substantially improved nonresidential structure will be
floodproofed. Upon completion of the floodproofed portion of the
structure, the permittee shall submit to the local administrator the
as-built floodproofed elevation, certified by a professional engineer
or surveyor.
(3) A certificate from a licensed professional engineer or architect that
any utility floodproofing will meet the criteria in § 123-15C,
Utilities.

or relocated as a result of proposed development. Computations by
a licensed professional engineer must be submitted that
demonstrate that the altered or relocated segment will provide
equal or greater conveyance than the original stream segment. The
applicant must submit any maps, computations or other material
required by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)
to revise the documents enumerated in § 123-6, when notified by
the local administrator, and must pay any fees or other costs
assessed by FEMA for this purpose. The applicant must also
provide assurances that the conveyance capacity of the altered or
relocated stream segment will be maintained.

following permit application review before issuing a floodplain
development permit:
(1) Review all applications for completeness, particularly with the
requirements of § 123-12C, Application for permit, and for
compliance with the provisions and standards of this chapter.
(2) Review subdivision and other proposed new development,
including manufactured home parks to determine whether
proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a
proposed building site is located in an area of special flood hazard,
all new construction and substantial improvements shall meet the
applicable standards of §§ 123-14 through 123-18 and, in
particular, § 123-14A, Subdivision proposals.
(3) Determine whether any proposed development in an area of special
flood hazard may result in physical damage to any other property
(e.g., stream bank erosion and increased flood velocities). The local
administrator may require the applicant to submit additional
technical analyses and data necessary to complete the
determination. If the proposed development may result in physical
damage to any other property or fails to meet the requirements of
§§ 123-14 through 123-18, no permit shall be issued. The applicant
may revise the application to include measures that mitigate or
eliminate the adverse effects and resubmit the application.
(4) Determine that all necessary permits have been received from
those governmental agencies from which approval is required by
state or federal law.
B. Use of other flood data.

areas of special flood hazard on the community's Flood Insurance
Rate Map (FIRM) but has neither produced water surface elevation
data (These areas are designated Zone A or V on the FIRM.) nor
identified a floodway, the local administrator shall obtain, review
and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data
available from a federal, state or other source, including data
developed pursuant to § 123-12C(7), as criteria for requiring that
new construction, substantial improvements or other proposed
development meet the requirements of this chapter.
(2) When base flood elevation data are not available, the local
administrator may use flood information from any other
authoritative source, such as historical data, to establish flood
§ 123-13 E-911 § 123-13
120:363
elevations within the areas of special flood hazard, for the purposes
of this chapter.
C. Alteration of watercourses.

elevation data are available, upon placement of the lowest floor or
completion of floodproofing of a new or substantially improved
structure, obtain from the permit holder a certification of the asbuilt
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, in
relation to mean sea level. The certificate shall be prepared by or
under the direct supervision of a licensed land surveyor or
professional engineer and certified by same. For manufactured
homes, the permit holder shall submit the certificate of elevation
upon placement of the structure on the site. A certificate of
elevation must also be submitted for a recreational vehicle if it
remains on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer (unless it is
fully licensed and ready for highway use).
(2) Any further work undertaken prior to submission and approval of
the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The local
administrator shall review all data submitted. Deficiencies detected
shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project unless
immediately corrected.
E. Inspections. The local administrator and/or the developer's engineer or
architect shall make periodic inspections at appropriate times
throughout the period of construction at a cost to be paid by the
applicant in order to monitor compliance with permit conditions and
enable said inspector to certify, if requested, that the development is in
compliance with the requirements of the floodplain development permit
and/or any variance provisions.
F. Stop-work orders.
(1) The local administrator shall issue, or cause to be issued, a stopwork
order for any floodplain development found ongoing without a
development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 123-9 of this chapter.

development permit. Disregard of a stop-work order shall subject
the violator to the penalties described in § 123-9 of this chapter.
G. Certificates of compliance.
(1) In areas of special flood hazard, as determined by documents
enumerated in § 123-6, it shall be unlawful to occupy or to permit
the use or occupancy of any building or premises, or both, or part
thereof hereafter created, erected, changed, converted or wholly or
partly altered or enlarged in its use or structure until a certificate
of compliance has been issued by the local administrator stating
that the building or land conforms to the requirements of this
chapter.
(2) A certificate of compliance shall be issued by the local
administrator upon satisfactory completion of all development in
areas of special flood hazard.
(3) Issuance of the certificate shall be based upon the inspections
conducted as prescribed in § 123-13E, Inspections, and/or any

structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that
items in § 123-19A(4)(a) through (l) have been fully considered. As
the lot size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical

§ 127-1. Legislative findings.
The City Council finds the raising of funds for the promotion of bona
fide charitable, educational, scientific, health, religious, patriotic and other
worthy causes, where the beneficiaries are undetermined, to be in the
public interest and that the mandate of § 9 of Article 1 of the Constitution
of the State of New York, as amended, should be carried out by rigid
regulations to prevent commercialized gambling, prevent participation by
criminal and other undesirable elements and prevent the diversion of funds
from the purposes herein authorized.
(6) Variances shall only be issued upon receiving written justification
of:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public or conflict with existing local laws
or ordinances.
(7) Notice.
(a) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted for a building with
the lowest floor below the base flood elevation shall be given
written notice over the signature of a community official that:

the base flood level will result in increased premium rates
for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100
of insurance coverage; and
[2] Such construction below the base flood level increases
risks to life and property.

GRAFFITI
§ 132-1. Legislative intent.
It is the intention of the City of Beacon City Council to promote the health,
safety and welfare of the residents of the City of Beacon by adopting a
local law designed to deter the defacing of public and private property
with aerosol spray paint cans, broad-tip markers, pens, writing and artistic
devices. The City Council finds further that such defacement of property is
most often committed by persons under 18 years of age using aerosol spray
paint cans and broad-tipped indelible markers; that such aerosol cans and
markers are frequently stolen from retail stores by such person; that such
persons rarely have a legitimate need for such aerosol cans or markers; that
where such a need exists, such aerosol cans and markers may be furnished
by a parent or guardian and, therefore, that, within the City, the sale of such
aerosol cans and markers to such persons would be restricted, and that
persons engaged in the retail sale of such aerosol cans and markers should
be required to take such reasonable steps to prevent the theft of such
cans and markers. Further, it is the recommendation of the City Council
that, where appropriate, the City Court require those who commit acts of
defacement to restore the property so damaged, or to perform suitable
alternate community service pursuant to the Court's direction.
§ 132-2. Definitions.
As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meanings

condition that, with the consent of the owner, the defendant restore the
property so defaced to its original condition (with five days) by means of
the defendant's own labor or on the condition of monetary restitution in an
amount not to exceed the cost of said restoration. Any person who violates
the provisions of § 132-3D and E of this chapter for a first offense shall be
guilty of a violation punishable by a fine of not more than $250, and for
A. No person shall write, paint, spray or draw any work, inscription,
design, figure or mark of any type on any public or private building or
other structure or any other real or personal property, regardless of
whether said property is publicly or privately owned, operated or
maintained, unless the express permission of the owner or operator of
the property has been obtained.

purpose sell or offer to sell such product or products to any such
purchaser.
D. Any person selling or offering for sale aerosol spray paint cans, broadtipped
markers, pens, writing and artistic devices shall post in a
conspicuous place a sign which clearly states: "It is unlawful to sell

intent to use the same for illegal purposes."

a second or subsequent offense shall be guilty of a Class B misdemeanor
punishable by a fine of not more than $500 or three months' imprisonment,

segregated in an account to be used only for beautification efforts
throughout the City of Beacon.
§ 132-5. Civil liability; removal of graffiti.
§ 132-6. Severability.

be adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, such
judgment shall not affect, impair or invalidate the remainder thereof, but
shall be confined in its operation to the clause, sentence, paragraphs,
section or part thereof directly involved in the controversy and in which
such judgment shall have been rendered.

public property or public building, or for the installation of a temporary
sign as described in § 223-15F of the Zoning Ordinance of the City of
Beacon if located in a nonresidential district. Nothing in this chapter shall
be construed to prevent the ordinary maintenance and repair of any exterior
architectural feature of a landmark or property within an historic district
which does not involve a change in design, material or outward appearance.
§ 134-7. Criteria for approval of certificate of appropriateness or
special permit in HDLO.
A. Historic districts are living entities that have typically grown and
accommodated change through multiple time periods. HDLO buildings
are recognized as models for how to design high-quality, enduring
structures that have gained in public appreciation over time, thereby
serving as excellent examples for sustainable development. In
reviewing an HDLO application and plans, the City Council or Planning
Board shall give consideration to:
(1) The historic or architectural value or significance of the structure
and its relation to the historic character of the surrounding area.
(2) The relationship of the exterior architectural features of such
structure to the rest of the structure and to the surrounding area.
(3) The compatibility of exterior design in terms of scale, arrangement,
texture and materials proposed, roof and cornice forms, spacing
and proportion of windows and doors, exterior architectural
details, signs, and street-front fixtures.
B. In applying the principle of compatibility, the City Council or Planning
Board shall use the following standards for new structures, additions,
or alterations in the HDLO. Standards using the verb "shall" are
required; "should" is used when the standard is to be applied unless the
Planning Board or City Council finds a strong justification for an
alternative solution in an unusual and specific circumstance; and "may"
means that the standard is an optional guideline that is encouraged but
not required.
(1) The design, character, and appropriateness to the property of the
proposed alteration or new construction.
(a) Construction shall build on the historic context with
applications required to demonstrate aspects of inspiration or
similarities to adjacent HDLO structures or historic buildings
in the surrounding area.
(b) Compatibility does not imply historic reproduction, but new
architecture shall also not arbitrarily impose contrasting
materials, scales, colors, or design features.
(c) The intent is to reinforce and extend the traditional patterns of
the HDLO district, but new structures may still be
§ 134-6 BEACON CODE § 134-7
132:392
distinguishable in up-to-date technologies and details, most
evident in window construction and interiors.
(d) Exterior accessory elements, such as signs, lighting fixtures,
and landscaping, shall emphasize continuity with adjacent
HDLO properties and the historic characteristics of the
sidewalk and streetscape.
(e) Where possible, parking shall be placed towards the rear of the
property in an unobtrusive location with adequate screening
from public views, unless another location provides better
screening.
(2) The scale and height of the proposed alteration or new construction
in relation to the property itself, surrounding properties, and the
neighborhood.
(a) Where possible, an addition to an historic structure should be
placed towards the rear, or at least recessed, so that the
historic structure remains more prominent than the subsidiary
addition.
(b) Any alteration or addition to an historic structure shall not

§ 145-1. Legislative findings and intent.
The Council finds that the General City Law has recently been amended
by adding a new provision which allows cities to adopt anti-loitering laws
and ordinances. The Council further finds that "quality of life" issues are
of paramount importance to citizens of Beacon, affecting not only their
physical well-being and safety, but their very sense of urban self. Persons
engaged in unlawful conduct in public places harass and unduly interfere
with the lawful use and enjoyment of such public places thereby
constituting a danger to the public health and safety. The Council therefore
finds it appropriate for the protection of the public safety and welfare to
enact legislation to ensure that public safety is not jeopardized by acts of
loitering when they are committed for the purpose of intimidation, coercion,
harassment, menacing or assaultive conduct in violation of applicable state
law. In addition, the City of Beacon has identified a significant trade in
controlled substances and marijuana on the streets of the City of Beacon
with the resulting increase in crimes related to such street trade. The
purpose of the following provisions of this chapter is to add to the crimefighting
abilities of the City of Beacon Police Department by prohibiting
loitering for the specific illegal purposes of possessing or using marijuana
or a controlled substance.

ARTICLE II
Public Nuisance Abatement
[Adopted 10-21-2019 by L.L. No. 8-201963]
§ 159-2. Findings and intent.
A. The City Council finds that public nuisances exist in the City of Beacon
in the operation of certain establishments and the use of property in
flagrant violation of certain Penal Law, New York State Uniform
Building and Fire Code and Municipal Code provisions, which
nuisances substantially and seriously interfere with the interest of the
public, in the quality of life and total community environment,
commerce in the City, property values and the public health, safety and
welfare. The City Council further finds that the occurrence of such
activities and violations is detrimental to the health, safety and welfare
of the City of Beacon and its neighborhoods thereof, businesses thereof
and visitors thereto.
B. As a result of the activities occurring at these properties, and/or the
conditions in which they are maintained, these properties tend to
receive and require more than the general, acceptable level of police
and code enforcement services. As a result, they place an undue and
inappropriate burden on the City's taxpayers. The City Council has
determined that existing laws do not sufficiently encourage such
property owners to take reasonable steps to abate the nuisances that
their properties are creating, and has determined that enhanced
penalties will give such property owners additional incentives to
ameliorate said problems and help to compensate the City for the
increase in code enforcement services.
C. This article is enacted to encourage property owners to recognize their
responsibility to ensure that activities occurring on their property
conform to the law and do not adversely affect their neighborhoods,
unduly burden the City's resources and provide a mechanism for the
City to take action against property owners who fail to ensure property
they own does not require a disproportionate level of the City's
resources to be devoted to such property.
D. This article is not intended to discourage crime victims or a person in
legitimate need of police services from requesting them.
E. This article does not affect a property owner's duty to comply with all
other laws governing residential tenancies which are contained in New
York State statutes.
63.Editors Note: This local law also repealed former Art. II, Public Nuisance Abatement,
adopted 5-16-2011 by L.L. No. 7-2011.
§ 159-2 LOITERING § 159-3
145:435

PUBLIC TRAIL REGULATIONS
GENERAL REFERENCES
Littering  See Ch. 143.
Noise  See Ch. 149.
Parks  See Ch. 155.
§ 170-1. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to provide rules and regulations for the
use of public trailways in the City of Beacon, including the Fishkill Creek
Greenway and Heritage Trail (FCGHT) extending from the Beacon Metro-
North train station to the Town of Fishkill. The FCGHT and other public
trails traverse public and private lands and the City finds that it is important
to establish a uniform set of rules and regulations governing the use of such
public trails for the protection of those using the trails as well as the private
landowners whose property abuts a trail or includes a trail pursuant to an
easement held by the City. In holding such easements and in establishing
public trails, the City and the grantors of the easements expressly rely upon
the protection against liability contained in § 9-103 of the New York State
General Obligations Law, as the same may be amended from time to time.
For such purposes, the City and Grantors of the easements, and their agents
and invitees, are deemed "occupants" of the easement areas. The Council
finds it appropriate for the protection of the public safety and welfare to
enact legislation to establish rules and regulations for the public trails.
Certain activities should be prohibited on public trails to protect the public
safety and to assure eligibility for participation in the Hudson River Valley
Greenway Trail Insurance program by grantors of the easements, if desired.
It is also appropriate that regulations applicable to the various trails in the
City be suited to the unique characteristics of each particular trail.
§ 170-2. Applicability.
This chapter shall apply to all public trails within the City of Beacon.
Supplemental regulations applying to particular trails shall apply to the
trails specified.
§ 170-3. Definitions.
For the purpose of this chapter, the terms used herein are defined as
follows:
PERSON  Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation or association of
persons, and the singular number shall include the plural.
TRAIL  All walkways and paths, not including sidewalks as defined in New
York State Vehicle and Traffic Law, Title 1, Article 1, § 14, and regulated
§ 169-8 LOITERING § 170-3
145:467
in the City of Beacon under Chapter 191, which are owned by the City of
Beacon, or over which the City holds an easement, and which are part of
the City's system of parks, or part of an organized system of trails, and
which are open to the public for stated uses subject to City regulation,
including, without limitation, the Fishkill Creek Greenway and Heritage
Trail (FCGHT), and other trails which may be added to the City's trail
system in the future. A trail may be comprised of wood chips, boardwalk,
stone dust, asphalt or concrete pavement or similar materials.
§ 170-4. Rules and regulations applicable to all City trails.
The following rules apply to the use of all City trails. Supplemental rules
may be established for particular trails, which are set forth in subsequent
sections.
A. Trails shall be open from sunrise to sunset and shall not be used by the
public outside those time limits. In addition, the Police Chief, City
Administrator or Highway Superintendent is authorized to close all or a
portion of any trail to the public for such a duration of time as
warranted for the general safety and welfare of the public, such
restrictions on use to be posted on the City website, with notice to be
posted at trail heads to the extent practicable under the circumstances.
B. In view of the natural and open character of trails, and the changing
character of the natural environment, the City can make no
representation that any trail is safely passable at all times when the
trail is open. All users of any trail shall approach such trail with caution
and use it prudently and safely at the trail user's own risk, in light of
seasonal, weather, and other natural conditions. The City shall not be
responsible for clearing snow, ice or floodwaters from the trail.
C. Persons shall keep to the right on all trails, with passing on the left.
Pedestrians shall be deemed to have the right-of-way, and all other
users, including any permitted nonmotorized bikers or cross-country
skiers, shall yield to pedestrians. All persons on trails shall yield to
slower users. Joggers and runners shall yield to hikers and walkers.
D. Where a trail does not have a separate lane for bicycle use, the City
shall have the authority to limit use of bicycles on certain designated
segments of any trail, to be marked by signage, based on all relevant
conditions, including nature of the surface, slopes, potential
interference with pedestrians and hikers or other users of the trail.
E. Where bicycle usage is permitted on a trail segment, the City shall have
authority to limit the permitted speed of bicycles.
F. Persons shall stay on the marked trails and within the designated public
use areas.
G. All users of the trail shall use the trail safely and in accordance with the
laws and ordinances of the City of Beacon and without creating a
nuisance and with common courtesy to all others on the trail.
§ 170-3 BEACON CODE § 170-4
145:468
H. Littering is prohibited and all persons shall carry out their trash from all
trails and properly dispose of the trash in suitable containers.
I. Pets shall be leashed at all times and persons accompanying the pet
shall collect and carry out and properly dispose of the pet's waste.
J. No person shall damage any trail, or any building, structure, fence,
picnic facility, or other improvement or amenity on or near a trail.
K. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing rules, or the
applicability of any general law or regulation, the following activities
are strictly prohibited on any trail within the City system:
(1) Overnight parking in parking areas serving the trail, including
parking outside the hours from sunrise to sunset, except as
otherwise permitted by the City Code.
(2) Use of motorized vehicles, including, but not limited to,
snowmobiles, motorcycles, motorbikes, motor-powered dirt bikes,
motor-powered ATVs (all-terrain vehicles) and all other motorized
bicycles.
(3) Downhill skiing, tobogganing, sledding, or snowboarding. Crosscountry
skiing may be permitted by the City on designated trails, or
sections thereof, found to have sufficient width for cross-country
skiing without interfering with pedestrian and hiker activity on the
trail.
(4) Competitive racing, except for designated special races or events
which have been permitted in advance by the City.
(5) Skateboarding.
(6) Roller skating.
(7) Dumping or littering.
(8) Smoking.
(9) Use of alcohol or controlled substances.
(10) Playing radios or other sound-transmitting devices.
(11) Damaging or removing plant or wildlife.
(12) Feeding wildlife.
(13) Fishing may be prohibited on certain trails, as per posted signage.
(14) Camping.
(15) Campfires or barbequing.
(16) Swimming, diving, public bathing or sunbathing.
(17) Hunting or discharging of firearms.
§ 170-4 LOITERING § 170-4
145:469
§ 170-5. Rules applicable to Fishkill Creek Greenway Heritage Trail
(FCGHT).
(18) Any act, amusement or practice, whether listed specifically above
or not, by which others on a trail could be endangered, or which
could reasonably interfere with the use of the trail by others for
recreational purposes, including, without limitation, blocking the
trail, or interfering with passage of others.
A. Findings. The Fishkill Creek Greenway Heritage Trail (FCGHT or the
"Trail") is a trail for passive, nonmotorized, pedestrian recreation in the
form of walking, hiking, and visual enjoyment of the Fishkill Creek
Corridor. The FCGHT Master Plan acknowledges that: "The FCGHT has
been placed to fit within the existing landscape conditions with a light
footprint and is intended to be active and serve uses in all four seasons.
The trail has been designed to accommodate foot traffic primarily,
although some sections may accommodate other uses. With the efforts
of the Beacon Loop Trail, a concurrent project for the development of a
city-wide pedestrian and bicycle trail, the FCGHT intends to serve a
more passive purpose." The FCGHT consists largely of easements over
private property. The FCGHT is, in many cases, located in close
proximity to residential dwellings and private property which is not
subject to an easement allowing public access. The Trail itself is
composed of varying materials and is not conducive to running or
bicycling. The Trail covers long distances in remote locations which
cannot be maintained to assure immediate removal of snow and ice. For
all these reasons, it is appropriate that additional restrictions be
imposed on the nature of the public use of the FCGHT.
B. In view of the natural and open character of FCGHT, and the changing
character of the natural environment, neither the City nor the private
property owners whose property is subject to a FCGHT easement can
make any representation that any portion of the Trail is safely passable
at all times when the Trail is open. All users of any Trail shall approach
such trail with caution and use it prudently and safely at the trail user's
own risk, in light of seasonal, weather, and other natural conditions.
The City and private property owners whose property is subject to a
FCGHT easement are not obligated to clear snow and ice from the Trail.
The FCGHT shall be closed during snow and ice storms.
C. Access to the FCGHT does not constitute permission to enter onto
private property adjoining the Trail. Entry on private property adjoining
the Trail is subject to prosecution as trespass under the New York State
Penal Law, in addition to constituting a violation of this section.
D. Without limiting the generality of the regulations in § 170-4, the
following additional activities are prohibited on the FCGHT:
(1) Riding bicycles, except in segments of the trail which have been
specifically designated by the City as appropriate for joint use by
bicycles and pedestrians, and signed for such dual use.
§ 170-4 BEACON CODE § 170-5
145:470
§ 170-6. Penalties for offenses.
If any person violates the provisions of this chapter or engages in conduct
in violation of this chapter, that person shall be subject to the penalties
set forth at § 1-3 of the City Code. Liability under this section shall be
in addition to liability under the provisions of the New York State Penal
Law, including but not limited to Penal Law § 145 (Criminal Mischief),
Penal Law § 150 (Arson), Penal Law § 240 (Offenses Against Public Order).
Violations of the Penal Law shall be punishable as either a misdemeanor or
felony as described under Penal Law § 55 (Classification and Designation of
Offenses).
§ 170-7. Enforcement.
The provisions of this chapter can be enforced by the City of Beacon Police
Department and any other police officer or peace officer or other person
who can lawfully make an arrest.

SAFE STORAGE AND DISPLAY OF FIREARMS
§ 174-1. Purpose.
The City Council hereby finds that the storage, possession and display
of firearms in the City of Beacon require the regulation thereof in the
public interest, convenience and necessity. In addition, the presence of
an unsecured, easily accessible, loaded firearm in the home increases the
likelihood of death or injury from accidents or impulsive acts. Guns left
unattended in the home should be kept locked or stored securely to prevent
access by children and others who should not have access to them. Gun
owners are responsible for keeping their firearms from falling into the
hands of children and other unauthorized individuals.
§ 174-2. Definitions.
Unless otherwise expressly stated, whenever used in this chapter, the
following words shall have the meanings given to them by this section when
used herein:
FIREARM  Any weapon from which a shot is discharged by force of an
explosive, or a weapon which acts by force of gunpowder, and shall include
any weapon capable of being loaded with powder, ball or ammunition, and
shall include any weapon which is otherwise capable of being loaded with
powder, ball or ammunition, whether completed, assembled or from which
any part or piece has been removed therefrom.
PERSON  Any person, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company or organization of any kind.
SAFE STORAGE DEPOSITORY  A safe or other secure container which,
when locked, is incapable of being opened without the key, combination or
other unlocking mechanism and is capable of preventing an unauthorized
person from obtaining access to and possession of the firearm contained
therein.
§ 174-3. Storage.
A. Firearms for sale shall be kept secured at all times when the place in
which they are held for sale is not open for business.
B. A person who stores or leaves on premises under his or her control a
loaded firearm and who knows or reasonably should know that a minor

such cases, the true name of the person holding such sale or benefiting
thereby shall fully appear.
B. Definition. The description "regular stock of goods" is intended to and
shall mean the stock of goods which a merchant has normally on hand
in the regular course of his business prior to becoming bankrupt,
making assignment or being classified under any of the captions, titles

goods.
A. Purposes. The purposes involved in the enactment of this chapter
include:
§ 175-8 REFRIGERATORS, ABANDONED § 179-1
171:481
(1) To prevent the introduction of pollutants which will interfere with
the operation of the City of Beacon's POTW facility.
(2) To allow the Beacon POTW to meet all NPDES and SPDES permit
requirements.
(3) To prevent the introduction of pollutants that will pass through the
Beacon POTW that will contaminate the receiving waters, the
sludge or the atmosphere around the Beacon POTW.
(4) To regulate the users of the POTW, whether they be direct or
indirect contributors, through the issuance of permits.
(5) To improve the opportunity to recover or reclaim wastewaters and
sludge from the Beacon POTW.
(6) To equitably distribute the operational costs of the Beacon POTW to
its users.
(7) To provide cooperation with, and abide by, the most stringent
standards of the Dutchess County Department of Health, the New
York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the
United States Environmental Protection Agency.
(8) To promote compliance with environmental laws and protect public
health by identifying, preventing and removing inflow and
infiltration.
B. Findings. The City Council of the City of Beacon finds the following:
(1) The City of Beacon sanitary sewer system owns, operates and
maintains an extensive network of sewer lines and a wastewater
treatment plant.
(2) The City's ability to effectively manage the sewer system is affected
by the proper maintenance and use of sewer service lines which is
the responsibility of the users of the sewer system.
(3) The introduction of large volumes of stormwater, surface water,
groundwater, roof runoff, subsurface drainage and other similar
discharges into the sanitary sewer system can result in sanitary
sewer overflows (and the release into the environment of untreated
sewage), and can also result in basement backups and other
undesirable consequences.
(4) It is the purpose of this chapter, by the application and enforcement
thereof, to deter, prevent and eliminate, so far as practical, the
introduction of stormwater, surface water, groundwater, roof
runoff, subsurface drainage and other similar discharges other
than domestic or industrial sewage into the sewer system.
(5) This chapter serves the public interest by promoting, to the
maximum extent practical, the development and implementation of

minimize danger to persons.
B. Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person
discharging to the municipality's MS4 in violation of this chapter may
have his/her MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or
reduce an illicit discharge. The SMO will notify a violator in writing of
the proposed termination of its MS4 access and the reasons therefor.
The violator may petition the SMO for a reconsideration and hearing.
Access may be granted by the SMO if he/she finds that the illicit
discharge has ceased and the discharger has taken steps to prevent its
recurrence. Access may be denied if the SMO determines in writing
that the illicit discharge has not ceased or is likely to recur. A person
commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises
terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior approval of the
SMO.
A. Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that the SMO must
inspect to enforce any provision of this chapter, or whenever the
authorized enforcement agency has cause to believe that there exists,

§ 189-12. Notification of spills.
Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person
responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency
response for a facility or operation, has information of any known or
suspected release of materials which is resulting or may result in illegal
discharges or pollutants discharging into the MS4, said person shall take all
necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such
release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, said person
shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence
via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of nonhazardous
materials, said person shall notify the municipality in person or by
telephone or facsimile no later than the next business day. Notifications
in person or by telephone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed

ARTICLE I
General Provisions
§ 190-1. Findings of fact.
It is hereby determined that:
§ 190-2. Purpose.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum stormwater
management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the
general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing within this
jurisdiction and to address the findings of fact in § 190-1 hereof. This
chapter seeks to meet those purposes by achieving the following objectives:
A. Land development activities and associated increases in site impervious
cover often alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and
increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream
channel erosion, or sediment transport and deposition;
B. This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of waterborne
pollutants, including siltation of aquatic habitat for fish and other
desirable species;
C. Clearing and grading during construction tends to increase soil erosion
and add to the loss of native vegetation necessary for terrestrial and
aquatic habitat;
D. Improper design and construction of stormwater management
practices can increase the velocity of stormwater runoff, thereby
increasing stream bank erosion and sedimentation;
E. Impervious surfaces allow less water to percolate into the soil, thereby
decreasing groundwater recharge and stream base flow;
F. Substantial economic losses can result from these adverse impacts on
the waters of the municipality;
G. Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and non-point source pollution can be
controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff
from land development activities;
H. The regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development
activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater
runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint
source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public
interest and will minimize threats to public health and safety.
I. Regulation of land development activities by means of performance
standards governing stormwater management and site design will
produce development compatible with the natural functions of a
particular site or an entire watershed and thereby mitigate the adverse
effects of erosion and sedimentation from development.
§ 190-1 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 190-2
187:523
§ 190-3. Statutory authority.
In accordance with § 10 of the Municipal Home Rule Law of the State of
New York, the City of Beacon has the authority to enact local laws and
amend local laws for the purpose of promoting the health, safety or general
welfare of the City of Beacon and for the protection and enhancement of
its physical environment. The City of Beacon City Council may include in
any such local law provisions for the appointment of any municipal officer,
employees, or independent contractor to effectuate, administer and enforce
such local law.
§ 190-4. Applicability.
A. Meet the requirements of minimum Measures 4 and 5 of the SPDES
General Permit for Stormwater Discharges from Municipal Separate
Stormwater Sewer Systems (MS4s), Permit No. GP-02-02 or as
amended or revised;
B. Require land development activities to conform to the substantive
requirements of the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation
State Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (SPDES) General Permit
for Construction Activities GP-02-01 or as amended or revised;
C. Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from land development
activities in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream
temperature, and stream bank erosion and maintain the integrity of
stream channels;
D. Minimize increases in pollution caused by stormwater runoff from land
development activities which would otherwise degrade local water
quality;
E. Minimize the total annual volume of stormwater runoff which flows
from any specific site during and following development to the
maximum extent practicable; and
F. Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint
source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater
management practices and to ensure that these management practices
are properly maintained and eliminate threats to public safety.
A. This chapter shall be applicable to all land development activities as
defined in Article II, § 190-6.

causing the water quality standards expedience in those water bodies.
TOTAL MAXIMUM DAILY LOAD (TMDL)  A calculation of the maximum
amount of a pollutant that a water body can receive and still meet water
quality standards, and an allocation of that amount to the pollutant's
sources. A TMDL specifies the allowable pollutant loading from all

background) at a level necessary to attain the applicable water quality
standards with seasonal variations and a margin of safety that takes into
account any lack of knowledge concerning the relationship between the
sources of the pollutant and water quality. In essence, a TMDL defines the
assimilative capacity of the water body to absorb a pollutant and still meet
water quality standards.
WATERCOURSE  A permanent or intermittent stream or other body of
water, either natural or man-made, which gathers or carries surface water.
WATERWAY  A channel that directs surface runoff to a watercourse or to
the public storm drain.

Planning Board for review and approval under the applicable
subdivision regulations of the City. Such roadway must not be subject to
any right or easement in others which will in any way interfere with its
use as a road at all times. Such roadway must be granted to the City full
covenant and warrantee deed containing the correct metes and bounds
description as shown on the approved map, which deed must be in such
form as may be required to entitle the same to be recorded in the office
of the County Clerk of Dutchess County, and the filing fees must be paid
by the applicant.
B. When required, permanent and temporary easements must be
furnished in said deed granting to the City the right to maintain all
outlets for surface water or natural stream drainage which will run
from such roadway over private property to a point where a natural

§ 192-3. Supersession of all prior requirements.
The provisions of this chapter supersede all prior regulations, specifications
and ordinances covered by the subject matter of this chapter.
§ 192-4. General provisions.
The proposed roadway must be constructed to conform to the minimum
requirements and standards set forth below. As directed by the City, the
minimum width to be cleared shall include all trees, road formations,
buildings, walls and any such things that would endanger those using such
roadway. The removal of such obstructions shall be borne by the person or
firm proposing such road.
§ 192-5. Alteration of approved plans.
Plans submitted shall not be altered or amended after having been approved
by the City Superintendent of Streets, City Engineer and City Planning
Board (where applicable) unless amended plans are resubmitted and
approved. However, the developer, at his own expense, shall provide
additional storm drainage facilities, under-drains, utilities, stabilization
elements or other miscellaneous improvements, as may be ordered by the
City Superintendent of Streets or City Engineer. If, during the course of
construction, in the opinion of the City Superintendent of Streets, City
Engineer, or the Dutchess County Department of Public Works, such
additional structures or facilities are necessary to prevent any need for
future installation of utilities, culverts or improvements within the roadway
to assure the durability of roadway structure, future maintenance of rightof-
way or welfare and safety of the public, it shall be the responsibility
of the developer to provide. However, the City and/or City Superintendent
of Streets may vary the requirements of such an order where there are
practical difficulties in the way of carrying out to the letter such order,
unless such variance conflicts with the provisions of a City or county official
drainage map, in which event the official map shall prevail. If these
specifications are amended prior to start of construction, the developer will
be required to comply with updated requirements, unless waived by the
City.
§ 192-6. Performance guarantees.
watercourse exists and to which such outlets and easement will carry
such water. A minimum thirty-foot width of easement shall be required
for the maintenance of said easements of stormwater, water or sewer
improvements.
A. Prior to the start of construction of any street, or prior to stamp of
approval in the case of applications before the Planning Board, the
developer shall deposit with the City Clerk a performance guarantee of
acceptable surety or shall deposit with the chief fiscal officer of the City
acceptable negotiable government bonds, cash or certified check drawn
§ 192-2 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 192-6
187:565
upon a national or state bank, payable on its face to the City of Beacon.
The amount of bond shall be equal to 100% of the cost of all
improvements as estimated by the City Engineer and approved by
the City Council. The amount shall be determined by applying to the
quantities or dimensions shown on the approved plans the rates per
unit as established by the City Engineer based on prevailing municipal
construction costs at the time of approval.
B. Within two years from the approval of the proposed subdivision by the
Planning Board the developer will complete all construction within the
right-of-way, including roadway, shoulders, curbs, if any, gutters, storm
drainage, etc., and all utilities, including hydrants and house
connections for each lot in accordance with the approved plans and
these specifications; and the developer shall adequately document that
all claims for labor and materials in connection with said construction
shall have been paid in full prior to offering said road for dedication to
the City.
C. If said construction is not completed to the satisfaction of the City
within this period, the developer shall, subject to the approval of the
City Council, maintain the performance bond in full effect until the work
is completed. Should the developer fail to obtain such approval and/or
allow the performance bond to lapse, the approval to construct the
improvements and the Planning Board approval shall be considered
void until such time that a new performance guarantee acceptable to
the City has been established.
D. Upon certification by the developer's professional engineer or qualified
licensed land surveyor and acceptance by the City Superintendent of
Streets or City Engineer that the construction of the street has been
completed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications,
the developer will offer to the City Council for dedication the completed
street and all other related improvements for public use free and clear
of the liens and encumbrances. This guarantee of dedication shall apply
to the owner of the property as well as the developer, where the two are
not synonymous.
E. At the time the performance guarantee is deposited with the City, or in
any case prior to commencement of the work, the developer shall make
payment to the City for all inspection fees associated with the work in
accordance with Standard Schedule of Fees and Subdivision
Regulations.86
F. Maintenance bonds. Prior to acceptance by the City of the dedication of
the street as guaranteed by § 192-6, Performance guarantees, above,
the developer shall deposit with the City Clerk a maintenance bond of
acceptable surety or shall deposit with the chief fiscal officer of the City
acceptable negotiable government bonds, cash or certified check drawn
upon a national or state bank, payable on its face to the City of Beacon,

§ 192-7. Classification of streets.
The City Planning Board and Planning Board Engineer shall determine
and designate into which of the following classifications each proposed
subdivision street falls on the basis of the criteria hereinafter set forth:
§ 192-8. Determining criteria.
guaranteeing that, for a period of one year from the date of acceptance
of the dedication of the street and other improvements by the City,
the developer will maintain the street and other public utilities and
improvements to the standard of construction set by these
specifications, normal wear and tear excepted. This shall be interpreted
to mean that the developer will, at his own expense, repair and make
good any defects or damage which may develop during this
maintenance period as a result of faulty construction within the rightof-
way or as a result of other construction by the developer outside
the right-of-way. During the maintenance period, the City shall be
responsible for snow and ice control, street cleaning of culverts and
catch basins and other work as familiar routine nature, provided that
such work has in no way been caused by the developer's operations. A
separate bond shall be established for two years in the case of street
trees.
G. The amount of the maintenance bond shall be at least equal to 10% of
the original amount of the performance bond. Subsequent to the
dedication of the street and after receipt of the maintenance bond, the
City Council shall release the performance bond.
A. Major street.
B. Suburban street.
C. Local street.
A. Major street: a street which serves or is designed to serve primarily as a
route for traffic between communities and/or large areas of the City.
B. Suburban street: a street which serves or is designed to serve as access
to abutting properties and to carry traffic from adjoining local streets to
the system of major streets.
C. Local street: a street which serves or is designed to serve primarily as
access to abutting residential properties.
D. The detail sheets located in Appendix A of this chapter show the cross
sections of each of the classifications for City streets.87 These give the

B. Sight distance requirements. All street and driveway intersections shall
meet the standards contained in the New York State Department of
Transportation publication entitled, "Policy and Standards for
Entrances to State Highways (February 1998)," or latest edition. More
specifically, said intersections shall, at a minimum, meet the
intersection sight distance (ISD) requirements in Tables 3 and 4 of said
publication. Notwithstanding the above, driveways which cannot meet
the ISD requirements shall, at a minimum, meet the stopping sight
distance (SSD) requirements in Table 5 of said publication.
C. Intersections.
(1) Intersections of major streets shall be at least 800 feet apart, if
possible. Cross (four-cornered) street intersections shall be
avoided insofar as possible, except at important traffic locations. A
distance at least equal to the minimum required lot width, but not
less than 150 feet, shall be maintained between center lines of
offset intersecting streets. Within 60 feet of the center of an
intersection, streets shall be at approximately right angles and
grades shall be limited to 1.5%. All street intersection corners shall
be bounded by curves of at least 25 feet in radius at the property
line. Wherever two streets intersect at an angle of less than 75°,
special pavement, channelization, right-of-way and/or sight
easement restrictions may be required.

minimum and 35 feet maximum.
(3) The grade of the intersecting street with a City or county road shall
be no more than one inch per foot from the edge of shoulder of the
City or county road to the right-of-way or road line of said road.
D. Grades and vertical curves. The grade of the street shall not be in
excess of 10% nor less than 1%. By permission of the City
Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer only shall a grade of
more than 10% be allowed due to topographic conditions. In no case
shall a grade exceed 12% without special exception by resolution of the
Planning Board. Difference in grade will be affected with a vertical
curve of sufficient length to allow a stopping sight distance of no less
than 250 feet, based on a driver's eye height at a three-and-five-tenthsfoot
elevation and an object height at a six-inch elevation.
E. Cul-de-sacs (dead-end streets). Cul-de-sacs shall be equipped with a
turnaround roadway with a minimum diameter of right-of-way of 130
feet with a minimum outside diameter of traveled way of 120 feet
(detail located in Appendix A88). The radii of the curves entering into,

construction (in addition to inspections by the developer's engineer). The
developer shall be responsible for scheduling the work so as to coordinate
all necessary inspections. Permanent concrete monuments shall be set
on right-of-way lines of streets at all intersections, angle points, point of
curvature and beginning and end of streets and at three points of all culde-
sacs. There shall be a clear view of adjacent monuments on the rightof-
way line. All monuments shall exist on completion of the construction of
the streets. The permanent markers shall be made of concrete or granite
with minimum dimensions of 30 inches long, four inches square top and size
inches square bottom, with a one-half-inch drilled hole in the top. Alternatetype
monument markers will be accepted where specifically approved by
the City Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer. If a monument
should be located in a rock edge, the surface shall be stripped and a onehalf-
inch steel rod drilled into the ledge. Monuments shall protrude three
inches above the final graded surface. The developer's licensed surveyor
shall certify that the location of all monuments is accurate before
acceptance of the street by the City Council.
§ 192-11. Easements.
§ 192-12. Clearing or grubbing.
A. Drainage easements. Where surface water from the street must lead
through other than gutters and storm drains or existing stream
channels outside the right-of-way, permanent drainage easements
having a minimum width of 30 feet shall be provided to a point where a
natural watercourse exists. In some cases, this may include easements
over property outside the boundaries of the subdivision involved.
Natural stream or ditch channels shall have a minimum of thirty-footwide
permanent easements and be shown on the proposed plans of a
subdivision. All permanent easement lines shall be monuments as a
right-of-way.
B. Sight easements. Sight easements shall be provided across all street
corners, outside the street right-of-way, within the triangular area
formed by the nearest edges of street pavement and a straight line
between two points, each 25 feet back from the theoretical intersection
of the edges of such pavement prolonged. The easements shall provide
that the holder of fee title to the abutting streets shall have the right to
enter the easement area for the purpose of clearing, pruning or
regrading so as to maintain a clear line of sight in either direction
across such triangular area between an observer's eye 3.5 feet above
the pavement surface on one street and an object one foot above the
pavement surface on the other. The initial establishment of clear sight
lines within the sight easement area shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider.

of Streets and the City Engineer. Such fill shall be made in layers of not
more than twelve inches each and properly compacted with a ten-ton
roller or equivalent.
B. The subgrade shall be shaped to line and grade with no depressions.
The subgrade shall be stable in all respects to the satisfaction of the
City Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer before the
foundation course is laid. No large stones or rock ledges shall protrude
into the foundation course.
C. Also, before the foundation course is laid, all storm drainage, catch
basins, watermains, manholes, sanitary sewers and all utilities,
including house connections for existing and future homes, and
hydrants shall have been installed and all excavations and trenches,
exclusive of pipe bedding, shall be backfilled with Item 4 (NYSDOT Item
304.03) to the satisfaction of the City Superintendent of Streets, Water
and Sewer Superintendent and the City Engineer. All slopes and
sidewalk areas shall be graded before the foundation course is made,
and all loose and exposed stones shall be removed.
A. Before fine grading or construction of curbs and sidewalks is started, all
storm and sanitary sewers and all utilities, including house connections
and hydrants, shall have been installed and all fill and backfill shall have
been thoroughly compacted to the satisfaction of the City

§ 192-15. Foundation course and granular material.
B. Also, before fine grading or construction of curbs and sidewalks is
started, all heavy trucking for building or site construction purposes
shall have been completed.
C. After completion of the rough grade and prior to the laying of the
foundation course, the subgrade shall be shaped to line and grade and
thoroughly compacted with an approved self-propelled roller weighing
not less than ten tons. All hollows and depressions which develop under
rolling shall be filled with acceptable granular material and again
rolled, this process to be continued until no depressions develop. The
subgrade shall not be muddy or otherwise unsatisfactory when the
foundation course is laid upon it.
D. Any soft, unstable, or unsuitable portions of the subgrade which
develop under "proof rolling" with a fully loaded tandem dump truck
shall be completely excavated and removed from the right-of-way and
shall be replaced with acceptable granular material and the area
regraded and compacted as above.
E. Prior to installation of foundation course, a nonwoven geotextile fabric
shall be laid upon the subgrade along the entire length of the proposed

well graded from coarse to fine, the maximum diameter of the large
particles not exceeding two inches; 25% to 60%, by weight, shall pass
the one-fourth-inch square sieve; 5% to 40%, by weight, shall pass the
No. 40 mesh sieve; and not more than 10%, by weight, shall pass the
No. 200 sieve. A certified analysis of granular material will be filed with
the City Superintendent of Streets and City Engineer.
B. The materials shall be placed on the finished subgrade by means of
mechanical spreaders and shall be thoroughly compacted by rolling
with a self-propelled ten-ton roller. Water shall be added to the
materials in such amounts as the City Superintendent of Streets and the
City Engineer may consider necessary for proper compaction. After
compaction, the course shall be true to grade and cross sections, and
depressions shall be eliminated by the use of additional granular
material thoroughly rolled in place. In all cases, the foundation course
must be thoroughly compacted so that it will not weave under the roller.
C. The subbase and foundation course shall lie a minimum of three months
to allow complete settlement before the pavement is laid. Prior to
placement of any pavement, all roadways shall be "proofed-rolled" with
a fully loaded tandem dump truck in the presence of the City
Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer, in a manner
prescribed by the City, and any defective or unacceptable sections shall
be reconstructed as necessary and retested prior to paving operations.
A. The drainage system and/or culverts shall be designed in accordance
with established engineering principles and approved by the City
Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer. Plans for any drainage
structure other than pipe culverts, when existing or proposed, shall be
submitted in detail to the City Superintendent of Streets and the City
Engineer for approval. The minimum grade of any drainage pipe or
culvert shall not be less than 1%. The approved plans shall show invert
elevations of the inlet and outlet of all drainage structures. Any
deviation from the approved plans shall be on approval of the City
Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer, in writing. No culvert
pipe shall be less than fifteen inches in diameter unless by approval of
the City Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer. Pipe for
culverts may be high density polyethylene pipe (HDPE) which shall
conform to the last ASTM and AASHTO standards, or, where approved,
reinforced concrete pipe may be permitted. End sections shall be
placed at all pipe inlet or outlet ends, where appropriate. Where
required, headwalls of concrete or mortared stone masonry shall be
constructed. Culverts shall extend to the toe of embankment. The
bearing of all headwalls shall have a solid base. If soft material is
encountered, it shall be removed and backfilled with NYSDOT Item No.
304.03. It shall be the responsibility of the developer that no headwalls
shall crack or become tipped from settlement. A concrete mix of 4,000
psi after 28 days shall be used.

B. The width of the trench in which the pipe (see trench detail in Appendix
A of this chapter91) is laid shall be sufficient to permit thorough
compaction of the backfill around the pipe and a minimum of 24 inches
wider than the pipe diameter. A cushion of at least six inches shall be
laid in line with grade prior to laying the pipe. No rock over three
inches in size shall protrude or lie in this cushion. The soil below the
cushion shall be stable enough so that there will be no settlement of
pipe after backfilling the trench.
C. The pipe shall be laid to true line and grade on the prepared bed of the
trench. Backfilling of the trench shall be done with roadway foundation
material or other suitable material approved by the City
Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer. The backfill shall be
made in layers of no more than six inches, which shall be compacted. In
no case shall the top of any drainage pipe be less then twelve inches
below the finished grade of pavement.
D. All drainage structures (pipes, basins, etc.) shall be of a size sufficient
to carry natural water runoff and stormwater and also that which, in the
opinion of the City Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer,
may be reasonably anticipated from future construction, both from
within the development and from adjoining properties, which normally
drain across the area of the proposed development. Sizing of all
structures shall comply with the City guidelines in effect at the time of
construction. Additional or larger culverts and drainage structures
shall be installed and paid for by the developer if the City
Superintendent of Streets and the City Engineer so direct. Drainage
structures (catch basin detail located in Appendix A of this chapter92)
shall be backfilled with NYSDOT Item No. 304.03. Backfill material
shall be "chucked" under the piping to ensure all voids are filled so as to
prevent settlement. Backfill material shall be compacted in 6-inch lifts
around catch basin structures.
A. Street signs of a type approved by the City Superintendent of Streets
and the City Engineer shall be installed by the developer. Prior to
naming a street, a check should be made with the City Clerk and 911
Coordinator to determine that the proposed name is not in use. All
names are subject to the approval of the City Council and 911
Coordinator. The developer shall also install all required traffic controls
signs, as recommended by the Chief of Police, City Superintendent of
Streets and the City Engineer, subject to the approval of the City
Council and Traffic Safety Board.

Application Procedure
§ 195-11. General procedure.
Whenever any subdivision of land is proposed, and before any contract
for the sale is carried out or title to any part thereof is transferred, the
subdividing owner, or his duly authorized agent, shall proceed to secure
approval of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following steps:
§ 195-12. Initial conference and review. [Amended 9-5-2017 by L.L.
No. 8-2017]
This step is recommended for the benefit of the applicant, but is not
required. If followed, the procedure shall be as follows:
§ 195-13. Preliminary plat.
A. Initial conference and review (recommended but not required).
B. Preparation of preliminary plat.
C. Preparation of final plat.
A. Initial conference. The applicant should notify the Planning Board
Secretary, at least one week in advance of a regular Planning Board
meeting, of his desire to be placed on the agenda for an initial
conference. At such conference, he shall present a sketch layout of the
proposed subdivision. It shall include a site location sketch (at a scale of
one inch equals 800 feet) indicating the applicant's entire holdings in
relation to neighboring streets, private roads and properties, and shall
show the general nature of the proposed arrangement of streets,
private roads, lots, recreation areas, and the proposed concept for
providing utility service. The applicant should also discuss with the
County Health Department its requirements in connection with
subdividing. The sketch layout shall be drawn on a topographic map
with a vertical contour interval of no more than five feet, at a scale of no
smaller than one inch equals 100 feet. It shall be submitted in four
copies. The applicant shall also provide the information required in
§ 223-61.4.
B. Field trip. After the initial conference, the Planning Board may schedule
a field trip to the proposed subdivision site. The applicant, or his
representative, should attend the site inspection and, prior to it, should
have the center line of all proposed streets and private roads located by
temporary stakes.
C. Planning Board recommendations. At or subsequent to the field trip, the
Planning Board shall advise the applicant, or his representative, of the
additions and modifications, if any, which should be made if an
application for subdivision approval is to be submitted.

Code.
B. Public hearing. Within 62 days of the official submission date of the final
subdivision application and all accompanying material, in form
satisfactory to the Planning Board, a public hearing shall be held by the
Planning Board, provided, however, that when the Planning Board
deems the final plat to be in substantial agreement with the approved
preliminary plat, the Board may waive the requirement for such a
public hearing. Notice of said hearing shall be provided by the applicant
in accordance with § 223-61.3 of the City of Beacon Zoning Code. A
copy of the proposed plat and construction plans shall be maintained on
file in the City Hall, available for public inspection during normal
business hours for the five-day period immediately preceding the
hearing.
C. Action by Planning Board. Within 62 days after the close of the public
hearing, or within 62 days of the official submission date of the final
application when a hearing is waived, the Planning Board shall by
resolution conditionally approve, with or without modification,

187:596
The Planning Board may extend by not more than two additional
periods of 90 days each the time in which a conditionally approved final

such extension is warranted by the particular circumstances.
E. Action by applicant. Based upon the Planning Board resolution, the
applicant shall have the final subdivision plat and construction plans
revised, if necessary, in accordance with said resolution, and submit
three copies of such revised maps to the Secretary of the Planning
Board. Any performance bond which is to be posted shall be submitted
to the City Attorney. The City Engineer shall check the revised final
maps to determine whether they are in full compliance with the
Planning Board's resolution of approval and, if so, shall so certify to the
Planning Board. The City Attorney shall be responsible for determining
and certifying to the Planning Board whether or not the surety, form,
sufficiency and manner of execution of the bond is acceptable to and
has been approved by the City Council.
F. Approval of construction plans. The construction plans, revised as
necessary to meet the requirements of the Planning Board resolution,
shall be endorsed by the Planning Board Chairman or other duly
authorized member of the Planning Board, as "approved" prior to the
signing of the plat or the beginning of any construction work within the
proposed subdivision.
G. Final approval of subdivision plat. The Chairman, or other duly
authorized member of the Planning Board, shall endorse the Board's
final approval on the plat only after receipt of certification from the City
Engineer that all required improvements have been completed in
accordance with the Planning Board's approval of the plat and
construction plans, or alternatively that a bond of the required amount
and surety has been filed and that all other required conditions of the
resolution of approval, including the payment of all fees, have been
complied with. Said endorsement shall be by signature and date on the
original of the plat (which shall be returned to the applicant for filing)
and on a print of the plat (which shall be retained in the record files of
the Planning Board).
H. Filing plat with County Clerk. The approved plat shall be filed with the
Dutchess County Clerk within 62 days of the date of Planning Board
signing. The approval of any plat not so filed shall expire 62 days from
the date of signing.
I. Plat void if revised after approval. No changes, erasures, modifications,
or revisions shall be made in any final plat after approval has been
given by the Board and endorsed, in writing, on the plat. In the event
that any final plat, when recorded, contains any such changes, the plat
shall be considered null and void, and the Board shall institute
proceedings to have said plat stricken from the records of the County
Clerk.

ARTICLE IV
Required Improvements and Agreements
§ 195-15. Completion of improvements or filing of bond.
A. Build or bond.
(1) After adoption of a resolution approving a final subdivision plat,
and before the plat is endorsed by the Planning Board Chairman or
other duly authorized member, the applicant shall be required to
complete, at his expense and without reimbursement by the City or
any special district, all street, private road and other improvements
as shown on the approved construction plans or otherwise specified
in the resolution, or, as an alternative, file with the City Council a
bond in an amount fixed by the Planning Board in its resolution as
sufficient to secure to the city the satisfactory construction,
installation, and completion of the required improvements. Such
bond shall state the period within which the required
improvements must be completed, which period shall be that
specified in the Planning Board resolution. The bond shall also
provide that:
(a) An amount determined adequate by the Planning Board but not
less than 10% of the bond, or 10% of the estimated costs of
improvements if a bond is not filed, shall be retained for a
period of one year after the date of completion of the required
improvements, to assure their satisfactory conditions; and
(b) That the street and/or private road shall be maintained in allweather
passable condition if certificates of occupancy are
issued during the term of the bond under the provisions of
§ 195-19 of this chapter.
(2) All improvements shall be performed to the satisfaction of the
Planning Board, in accordance with the approved construction
plans and the requirements of this chapter and the City Street
Specifications.99
B. Failure to complete improvements.
(1) Where a bond is not filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the period specified in the Planning Board
resolution of approval, such approval shall be deemed to have
expired, unless, upon request of the applicant, the period has been
extended by resolution of the Planning Board.
(2) Where a bond is filed. If all required improvements are not
completed within the term specified by the Planning Board and set
forth in the filed bond, and if no application for the extension of
such period and bond has been made by the applicant and
99.Editor's Note: See Ch. 192, Street Specifications.
§ 195-15 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-15
187:599
§ 195-16. Inspection of improvements.
The City Engineer shall be responsible for inspecting required
improvements during construction to insure their satisfactory completion
and, upon such completion, shall furnish the Planning Board with a
statement to that effect. If the City Engineer determines that any of the
required improvements have not been constructed in accordance with the
approved plan, the applicant shall be responsible for properly completing
said improvements. Failure of the City Engineer to carry out inspections
of required improvements during construction shall not in any way relieve
approved by the Planning Board, the City Council may thereupon
declare said bond to be in default and collect the sum remaining
payable thereunder and, upon receipt of the proceeds thereof, the
City shall install such improvements as are covered by the bond
and are commensurate with the extent of building development
that has taken place in the subdivision but not exceeding, in cost,
the amount of such proceeds.
C. Modification of bond. Extension of period specified in bond. The time
period specified for the completion of all required improvements, as set
forth in the bond, may be extended only by resolution of the Planning
Board upon request by the applicant setting forth, in detail, the amount
of work which has been completed as certified by the applicant's
engineer, reasons for failure to complete the remainder of the work
within the specified period, the maximum estimated time required to
complete the remainder of the work, and the time period extension
which is requested.
D. Reduction of bond. An applicant may request, in writing, that the City
Council authorize a reduction in the amount of the bond. Such request
shall itemize the extent of required improvements already completed,
the estimated cost of improvements remaining to be completed, and the
amount of bond reduction requested. Then, upon approval of the City
Council, if it determines that sufficient required improvements have
been installed to warrant such action, reduce the face amount of the
bond by an appropriate amount so that the new amount will cover the
cost in full of all required improvements remaining to be completed,
and any security deposited with the bond may be reduced
proportionately.
E. Modification of requirements. If, at any time, either before or during the
course of construction of the required improvements, it is determined
by the Planning Board that unforeseen conditions make it necessary to
modify the location or design of any improvements, the Board may
modify the terms and conditions of the approval so as to require such
changes as may be necessary to comply with the spirit and intent of the
Board's original approval and to conform to accepted engineering
practices. If such modification affects the scope of work covered by a
bond, the Board may require or allow appropriate modification of such
bond.

187:600
the applicant or the bonding company of their responsibilities related to the
proper construction of such improvements.
A. Inspection of stages of construction.
(1) To facilitate inspection of required improvements during
construction, the applicant shall notify the City Engineer at least
three working days prior to starting each of the following states of
construction:
(a) Clearing and rough grading of site.
(b) Installation of drainage and other underground facilities to be
installed.
(c) Installation of gravel base for proposed streets and private
roads.
(d) Installation of new curbing and sidewalks.
(e) When each pavement course is being applied.
(f) After completion of all improvements.
(2) The applicant shall not proceed to work on any stage subsequent to
the first stage until the work of the previous stage has been
inspected and approved by the City Engineer or his duly authorized
representative. In the case of any other improvements, the City
Engineer shall inspect the work at such progressive stages as he
shall specify, and he shall certify to the Planning Board that the
work was inspected by him and was in accordance with the
approved plans and specifications.
B. The applicant and/or contractor shall submit to the City Engineer shop
drawings and mix design certifications for all materials to be used to
construct project. The applicant shall furnish a certification from the
bituminous concrete supplier, and concrete supplier, providing mix
data, including aggregate source and grading, quantities of all
ingredients, critical temperatures, slump data, and strength data for
concrete.
C. Test specimens. When test specimens are requested by the City
Engineer or his duly authorized representative, the contractor shall
have an independent testing lab take the necessary samples selected by
the City Engineer. Costs of tests and reports shall be borne entirely by
the applicant.
D. Certificate of construction. At such time as the applicant has completed
construction of all required improvements, he shall furnish to the City
Engineer three copies of as-built plans and profiles which show the
actual location of all paved streets, private roads, culverts, headwalls,
drains, manholes, catch basins, sidewalks, curbs, utility lines and
equipment, monuments, street and private road signs, street and

private road trees, and all other required improvements, as
constructed, and all other pertinent information, such as cross sections
of the streets and private roads at intervals determined by the City
Engineer, the culvert and drain grades, sewer grades, sidewalk and
curb grades, and invert elevations at manholes. Such plans and profiles
shall bear a dated certification by a professional engineer or licensed
surveyor to the effect that the data shown thereon was accurately
determined by filed survey. If the location or accuracy of improvements
does not, in the opinion of the Planning Board, fully comply with the
approved construction plans and specifications, the Planning Board
shall have the right to refuse to sign the final plat or release the bond
until such situation is corrected.
E. Cost of inspection. In all cases, the applicant shall be required to bear
the costs, including, but not limited to, technical consultants retained
by the City, incurred by the City in conducting inspections required by
the City Code. Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the applicant
shall be required to pay an inspection fee, payable to the City of Beacon,
in an amount equal to 6% of the estimated construction cost as a
condition of plat approval. The City may require a deposit into an
escrow account, in an amount to be determined by the City Engineer, to
be applied against any costs that exceed an amount equal to 6% of the
estimated construction costs. If an escrow account is required and
becomes depleted, it shall be fully replenished prior to any additional
work being performed by the City or a third party for the City. Any
unused escrow shall be returned within 60 days of proof of compliance
with this chapter. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued if any
inspection fee remains unpaid. [Amended 5-17-2010 by L.L. No.
7-2010]
A. Offers of cession. All streets, parks and easements shall be indicated on
the plat. In accordance with the General City Law, the applicant may
add as part of the plat a notation, if he so desires, to the effect that no
offer of dedication of such streets or parks, or any of them, is made to
the public. All offers of cession to the public of all streets and parks not
so marked shall be filed with the Planning Board at the time of
submission of the final application.
B. Petition for dedication. Upon completion of the subdivision and the
street(s), a petition in the form required by the City Council shall be
filed with such Council for the acceptance and dedication of the
street(s) and the acceptance of parks or any other reservations or
easements.
C. Acceptance by city. Acceptance of any offer of cession of streets or
parks shall rest with the City Council. In the event that the applicant
shall elect not to file the plat in the Office of the County Clerk within the
period prescribed for such filing, then such formal offer of cession shall
be deemed void. The approval by the Planning Board of a subdivision

§ 195-18. Waiver of required improvements.
The Planning Board may waive, subject to appropriate conditions, the
provision of any or all such improvements and requirements as, in its
judgment of the special circumstances of a particular plat, are not requisite
in the interest of the public health, safety and general welfare, or which in
its judgment are inappropriate because of inadequacy or lack of connecting
facilities adjacent or in proximity to the subdivision.
§ 195-19. Certificates of occupancy for structures fronting on
bonded streets and private roads.
A certificate of occupancy shall not be issued for a structure within a
subdivision where the improvements are guaranteed by a performance
bond unless it is determined by the City Engineer that both of the following
conditions have been complied with:
plat shall not be deemed to constitute nor imply the acceptance by the
City of any streets, parks or other areas shown on said plat, and the
Planning Board may require the addition of appropriate notes to this
effect on the plat.
D. Maintenance. In the event that no offer of cession to the public is made
for the streets, parks and required easements shown on the plat, there
shall be submitted with the final application copies of agreements or
other documents providing for the suitable maintenance of such
facilities and a statement of all rights which exist with respect to each
of them. The adequacy of such documents shall be subject to Planning
Board approval.
A. Status of street and private road improvements. The improvement of
the street, streets, private road or private roads giving access to the
structure has progressed to a stage deemed adequate by the City
Engineer to render safe all-weather vehicular access for both routing
and emergency purposes.
B. Maintenance agreements. Written agreements satisfactory to the City
Attorney have been filed providing for the maintenance of the bonded
street or streets in such all-weather passable condition, including snow
removal and sanding, during the period between the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy and the acceptance of the fully completed
street by the City Council. If the private road is not to be offered for
dedication to the City, such an agreement will have been required in
accordance with § 195-17D of this chapter.

ARTICLE V
General Requirements for Subdivision Design
§ 195-20. Minimum requirements; general standards.
A. The Planning Board, in considering an application for the subdivision of
land, shall be guided by the following considerations and standards,
which standards shall be deemed to be the minimum requirements for
the convenience, health, safety and welfare of the City.
B. General standards.
(1) Character of land. Land to be subdivided shall be of such character
that it can be used safely for building purposes without danger to
health or peril from fire, flood or other menace. Land subject to
such hazards shall not be subdivided nor developed for residential
purposes, nor for such other uses as may increase danger to health,
life or property, or aggravate a flood hazard, but such land may be
set aside for uses as shall not involve such danger nor produce
unsatisfactory living conditions.
(2) Preservation of natural features.
(a) Land to be subdivided shall be designed in reasonable
conformity to existing topography in order to minimize
grading, cut and fill, and to retain, insofar as possible, the
natural contours, to limit stormwater runoff, and to conserve
the natural vegetative cover and soil. No tree, topsoil or
excavated material shall be removed from its natural position
except where necessary and incidental to the improvement of
lots and the construction of streets, private roads and related
facilities in accordance with the approved plan. Topsoil shall be
restored to a depth of at least six inches and properly seeded
and fertilized in those disturbed areas not occupied by
buildings or structures.
(b) Existing natural features which are of ecological, aesthetic or
scenic value to residential development or to the City as a
whole, such as wetlands, watercourses, water bodies, rock
formations, stands of trees, historic spots, and similar
irreplaceable assets, shall be preserved, insofar as possible,
through harmonious design of the subdivision and, where
appropriate, the Planning Board may require the inclusion of
such features in permanent reservations.
(3) Conformity to City Development Plan and Official Map. Streets,
parks and other subdivision features shall conform to the City
Development Plan and the Official Map.
(4) Frontage on improved streets. The area proposed to be subdivided
shall have frontage on and direct access to a street duly placed on
the Official Map, and if such street is not improved to the
§ 195-20 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-20
187:605
§ 195-21. Streets.
satisfaction of the Planning Board, such improvements shall be a
condition of subdivision approval.
A. Location, width and improvement. Streets shall be suitably located, of
sufficient width, and adequately improved to accommodate the
expected traffic and to afford satisfactory access to police, fire-fighting,
snow removal and other utility and street maintenance equipment, and
shall be coordinated so as to compose a safe and convenient system.
The location, arrangement or design of street shall be such as to cause
no undue hardship to adjoining properties.
B. Relation to topography. Streets shall be appropriately related to the
natural topography and shall be arranged so as to obtain as many as
possible of the building sites at, or above, the grades of the streets. A
combination of steep grades and curves shall be avoided.
C. Intersections. Intersections of major streets shall be at least 800 feet
apart, if possible. Cross (four-cornered) street intersections shall be
avoided insofar as possible, except at important traffic locations. A
distance at least equal to the minimum required lot width, but not less
than 150 feet, shall be maintained between center lines of offset
intersecting streets. Within 60 feet of the center of an intersection,
streets shall be at approximately right angles and grades shall be
limited to 1.5%. All street intersection corners shall be bounded by
curves of at least 25 feet in radius at the property line. Wherever two
streets intersect at an angle of less than 75°, special pavement,
channelization, right-of-way and/or sight easement restrictions may be
required by the Planning Board.
D. Block size. Within any zoning district, block dimensions shall be at least
twice the minimum lot depth and generally not more than 12 times the
minimum lot width. In long blocks, the Planning Board may require the
reservation through the block of a twenty-foot-wide easement to
accommodate utilities or pedestrian traffic.
E. Continuation of streets into adjacent properties.
(1) The arrangement of streets shall provide for their continuation
between adjacent properties where such continuation is
determined necessary for proper traffic movement, effective fire
protection, efficient provision of utilities, snow removal and other
services, and/or where such continuation is in accordance with the
City Development Plan. Alternatively, if a street continuation is not
determined to be warranted by the circumstances, or would result
in unsafe traffic conditions or otherwise jeopardize the public
safety and welfare, the Planning Board may require such street to
be terminated short of the boundary lines of the subdivision.
§ 195-20 BEACON CODE § 195-21
187:606
(2) Where a continuation of a street beyond the boundaries of a
subdivision is warranted, but the adjacent property is undeveloped
and the street must dead-end temporarily, the Planning Board may
require that the right-of-way and all improvements be extended to
the property line. A temporary circular turnaround of a minimum of
50 feet in radius shall be provided on all temporary dead-end
streets in excess of 100 feet in length, with a notation on the plat
that land outside the normal street right-of-way shall revert to
abutting property owners upon continuation of the street. The
length of temporary dead-end streets shall normally be limited to
not more than double the permitted length of permanent dead-end
streets.
(3) Where a turnaround exists at the end of a street within an adjoining
development to which a proposed street is to connect, the applicant
may be required to remove the portions of the turnaround
pavement outside of the normal width of the traveled way, perform
any necessary reconstruction of the pavement edge, construct
continuations of any existing driveways to the new pavement edge,
and regrade, seed and drain the disturbed areas in such a manner
as to blend them in with the surrounding landscape.
F. A permanent dead-end street.
(1) Where a street does not extend to the boundary of a subdivision
and its future continuation is not required by the Board, it shall be
separated from such boundary by a distance not less than the
minimum required lot depth. The Planning Board may require the
reservation of a twenty-foot-wide easement to the boundary to
accommodate utilities, drainage facilities and/or pedestrian traffic.
A circular turnaround of a minimum right-of-way radius of 65 feet
shall be provided at the end of a permanent dead-end street.
(2) For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, the nonlooped portion of permanent dead-end streets
shall, in general, be limited in length, exclusive of the turnaround,
to eight times the minimum lot width for the zoning district in
which it is located.
G. Street names. All streets shall be named, and such names shall be
subject to the approval of the Planning Board. Prior to naming streets,
the Planning Board shall confer with the Beacon Historical Society for
the purpose of receiving recommendations for the naming of streets
after notable persons in Beacon's history. Street names shall be
sufficiently different in sound and in spelling from other names in the
City so as not to cause confusion. A street which is a continuation of an
existing street shall bear the same name. In general, street names shall
conform to the following classifications:
(1) Avenue, street or road: major or collector street.
(2) Drive or lane: minor residential streets, except as follows:
§ 195-21 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-21
187:607
§ 195-22. Private roads.
(a) Court or place: permanent dead-end street.
(b) Circle or loop: street that returns to a starting point, or a street
both ends of which intersect another street at different
locations.
A. General requirements. Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter
which pertain to major, suburban and local streets, the following
general requirements shall apply to private roads.
(1) Private roads of the design described in Subsection B below shall
only be utilized to serve lots for single-family use. For the purposes
of determining use of a private road, no distinction shall be made
between developed and nondeveloped residential lots; lots in either
condition shall be eligible for access by a private road.
(2) A private road of the design described in Subsection B below shall
not provide access for more than four residential lots, except that
up to two additional lots may use the private road, if a private
agreement so allows, provided that those two additional lots have
the minimum required frontage on a public street.
(3) Notwithstanding the subsection immediately above, in order to
create in excess of four lots on a private road of the design
described in Subsection B below (six if two additional lots have
required frontage), said private road shall either be owned by a
homeowners' or condominium association, or shall have first been
improved to the current applicable street specifications, dedicated
to and accepted by the City or other governmental authority, in
which latter case it shall cease to be a private road.
(4) For greater convenience to traffic and more effective police and fire
protection, the nonlooped portion of permanent dead-end private
roads shall, in general, be limited in length, exclusive of the
turnaround, to eight times the minimum lot width for the zoning
district in which it is located.
(5) If the total length of all private roads in a subdivision exceeds eight
times the minimum lot width for the zoning district in which they
are located, then the private road(s) must be owned by a
homeowners' or condominium association.
(6) The City Planning Board shall not approve the use of a private road
in any subdivision if it is determined that the use of said private
road is not consistent with the health, safety, welfare and
convenience of the proposed users of the road and the people of the
City in general.
(7) To the extent practicable, the owner of any lot having access only to
an approved private road shall be the owner of the portion of the
§ 195-21 BEACON CODE § 195-22
187:608
private road adjacent to his lot to the center line of said private
road unless such other ownership provisions have been shown on
the filed subdivision plat, as approved by the Planning Board.
(8) In all cases, dimensions used in determining compliance with the
applicable zoning district (i.e., area, setbacks, frontage, etc.) shall
be calculated and measured from or along the right-of-way lines
(easement lines) indicated for the private road.
(9) Responsibility for maintenance.
(a) Where a subdivision plat containing a private road is approved
and filed with the Dutchess County Clerk, such subdivision plat
shall contain a note clearly stating that the subdivision
contains a private road which the City of Beacon has no
responsibility to maintain, provide services for, nor make any
improvements to; all such costs shall be borne by the property
owners using said road in accordance with the terms of a
maintenance declaration or agreement, as referenced herein
below.
(b) All private roads will have provisions for the maintenance of
the private road, drainage facilities and other improvements
incorporated in a maintenance declaration or agreement which
shall be recorded in the Dutchess County Clerk's Office at the
time of the filing of the subdivision plat and prior to the
transfer of any subdivision lot (with a copy of the recorded
documents submitted to the City Clerk for filing).
(c) A private road may not be offered for dedication to the City
unless the owners of the private road shall first have caused it
to meet or exceed the specifications set forth in this chapter for
a public street for acceptance by the City of Beacon.
(10) The Planning Board shall require, as a condition of approval, that a
performance guarantee and inspection fees be posted with the City
of Beacon, in a manner set forth in this chapter, to guarantee the
proper installation and the upkeep of the private road and
associated improvements.
(11) An index shall be kept by the City Clerk of all subdivisions approved
by the Planning Board which contain private roads. Said
subdivision shall be indexed by name, Tax Map designation(s) and
date of approval.
B. Construction specifications and additional requirements for private
roads serving up to six lots. Notwithstanding other provisions of this
chapter which pertain to major, suburban and local streets, the
following construction specifications and additional requirements shall
apply to private roads serving up to six lots. If the Planning Board shall
authorize the construction of a private road in accordance with the
§ 195-22 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-22
187:609
standards set forth in this chapter, said private road shall conform to
the minimum standards set forth below:
(1) The private road will have the subbase prepared and compacted to
maximum density (minimum 95%). Where grade alteration is
required, the same shall be accomplished by the use of Item 4,
compacted to maximum density (minimum 95%). Materials shall be
certified by the design engineer as suitable for the purposes
indicated.
(2) Said private road will have a base course which shall consist of a
minimum of eight inches of crushed stone or graded gravel base,
with a four-inch choker course of stone tailings or fine dust-free
material placed on top of said base course, all of which will be
compacted to maximum density (minimum 95%). A two-inch binder
course and a final surface treatment finish of one-inch top course
shall be placed, to result in a dust-free surface.
(3) A private road shall not be less than 18 feet in width (finished
surface). In areas where the road will be in a cut through the
existing topography, the road shall be provided with one-foot wide
shoulders which shall be constructed of Item 4. Swales adjacent to
the shoulders shall be a minimum of eight inches in depth and 1.5
feet wide. The swales shall be grass lined or stone lined, as deemed
appropriate for the site condition, as determined by the Street
Superintendent and City Engineer.
(4) All side slopes adjacent to or part of any private road shall not be
steeper than a slope of two to one in areas where the road will be in
a cut through the existing topography. A "two-to-one slope" is
defined as a drop of one unit of distance vertically for every two
units of distance horizontally. In areas where the road will be in a
fill section, side slopes shall not exceed a three-to-one slope.
(5) The right-of-way reserved for all private roads shall not be less than
50 feet in width; rights-of-way for cul-de-sacs shall not be less than
120 feet in diameter. If the private road contains utilities that are to
be publicly owned and maintained, then an easement shall be
granted to the City of Beacon over the entire right-of-way reserved
for the private road.
(6) If any private road shall end in a cul-de-sac, said cul-de-sac shall
have a finished surface being not less than 100 feet in roadway
diameter. Alternate layouts will be considered, subject to Planning
Board approval, when site conditions make construction of the fullsize
cul-de-sac impractical.
(7) If a private road is constructed over a place where water runs
regularly or seasonally underneath said road, or will be caused to
do so as part of the proposed subdivision, smooth-line polyethylene
pipe culvert or Planning Board approved equal shall be installed
underneath the road to permit the passage of water under said
§ 195-22 BEACON CODE § 195-22
187:610
§ 195-23. Improvements.
road. The size of said pipe shall be calculated by the applicant's
engineer and shall be as acceptable to the City Engineer.
(8) All private roads will be required to have a street name, which shall
not duplicate the name of an existing street or be so similar to the
name of an existing street as to be easily confused with it. Such
name shall be posted by street sign in equal construction and
character as those signs currently installed by the City for public
roadways and shall also include a separate and similar sign with
identification as a private road.
(9) Private roads shall be designed in accordance with the City Street
Specifications100 with regard to sight distance, road grades,
horizontal and vertical curves, and intersection design.
C. Construction specifications and additional requirements for private
roads serving other than up to six lots. A private road serving more than
six lots, serving an attached single-family (townhouse) or multifamily
residential development, or owned by a homeowners' or condominium
association shall be designed to such standards and construction
specifications as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board, taking
into consideration such matters including, but not necessarily limited to
traffic generation and capacity, the minimizing of adverse
environmental impacts, the length of the private road, overall density,
setback requirements, health safety and welfare, and all other generally
accepted planning standards.
A. Street improvements. Streets shall be graded and improved with
pavement, sidewalks, curbs, gutters, street signs, street trees, water
mains, sanitary sewers, storm drains, fire alarm signal devices, fire
hydrants and other utilities, except that the Planning Board may waive,
subject to appropriate conditions, such improvements as it considers
are not requisite in the interest of the public health, safety and welfare.
The subdivider shall install underground service connections to the
property line of each lot before the street is paved. Except where
waivers are granted, all such grading and street improvements shall
conform in all respects to this chapter and to Chapter 192, Street
Specifications.
B. Drainage requirements.
(1) The applicant may be required by the Planning Board to carry away
by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may exist
either previous to, or as a result of, the subdivision. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the street or private road right-of-way
where feasible, or in perpetual unobstructed easements of
100. Editor's Note: See Ch. 192, Street Specifications.
§ 195-22 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-23
187:611
appropriate width, and shall be constructed in accordance with the
City Construction Standards and Specifications.
(2) If a subdivision contains an existing drainage channel conveying
surface water from an off-site upstream drainage area, the
applicant shall be required to provide for the conveyance of such
surface water runoff through the project. Drainage pipes and/or
other conveyance facilities shall be provided large enough, in each
subdivision and for each existing drainage channel, to convey
potential runoff from the entire upstream drainage area through
the subdivision, based on a one-hundred-year storm. The intent of
this provision is to maintain the existing watershed drainage
pattern as closely as possible and to safely convey stormwater
runoff from the upstream drainage area through the subdivision.
Further, the applicant shall also be required to install drainage
pipes and/or other conveyance facilities in the subdivision to
accommodate on-site-generated stormwater runoff which traverses
the subdivision for a twenty-five-year storm based on
postdevelopment conditions.
(3) The Planning Board may require the applicant to prepare a study of
the effects of the subdivision on existing downstream drainage
facilities based on the one-hundred-year storm. Where such study
or the Planning Board, after an independent analysis, determines
that the additional runoff resulting from the development of the
subdivision will adversely impact existing downstream properties
or drainage facilities, the Planning Board may withhold approval
until provision has been made for the correction of said potential
condition. An acceptable corrective provision may be the addition
of on-site retention and/or detention of the increased
postdevelopment stormwater runoff from the subdivision so that
there will be no net increase in the peak rate of stormwater runoff
over the subdivision's predevelopment rate.
(4) The applicant shall be responsible for submitting computations to
the City Engineer in sufficient detail to make possible the ready
determination of the adequacy of the proposed drainage facilities,
and the City Engineer shall be responsible for reviewing these and
preparing recommendations for the Planning Board.
C. Underground utilities. In order to assure greater safety and improved
appearance, all utility lines and related equipment for providing power
and communication services shall be installed in the manner prescribed
by the regulations of the utility company having jurisdiction.
Underground utility lines shall be located outside of the traveled way of
the streets and private roads but, except in unusual circumstances,
within the right of way. Underground service connections shall be
provided to the property line of each lot before the street or private
road is paved and may pass under the traveled way of the street or
private road.
§ 195-23 BEACON CODE § 195-23
187:612
D. Other improvements.
(1) Monuments.
(a) Monuments shall be required wherever deemed necessary by
the Planning Board to enable all lines to be readily reproduced
on the ground. In general, monuments shall be located no more
than 500 feet apart on street or private road lines, preferably
at street, private road, lot, or easement corners or at points of
curvature or tangency on curved streets or private roads, and
spaced to be within sight of one another along lines entirely
within the street or private road right-of-way.
(b) Monuments shall be set vertically in solid ground three inches
above ground surface with accurate reference to a
permanently identifiable fixed point, and shall meet or exceed
the construction requirements specified in the City
Construction Standards and Specifications.
(2) Traffic control, street and private road signs. Traffic control, street
and private road signs shall be provided by the subdivider. See
§ 192-17 of Chapter 192, Street Specifications, for additional
regulations.
(3) Streetlighting standards. Where required by the Planning Board,
street and private road lighting standards, of a design and location
approved by said Board, shall be provided and installed by the
subdivider.
(4) Sanitary sewers and sewerage facilities, water mains and water
supply facilities, and fire hydrants. The subdivider shall install
sanitary sewers and sewerage facilities and/or water mains and
water supply facilities and fire hydrants of the type and in a manner
prescribed by appropriate City regulations.
(5) Street and private road trees. The Planning Board may require the
planting of street and private road trees. Such trees shall be of a
hardwood variety indigenous to the neighborhood, and shall be at
least four inches caliper at a height of four feet above ground level.
Where they are required by the Planning Board, such trees shall be
planted along both sides of the street or private road, within the
street or private road right-of-way, and spaced approximately 40
feet on center. Such trees shall be guaranteed to survive two
growing seasons.
(6) School bus pickup areas. The Planning Board may require that the
subdivider reserve, clear, grade, pave and otherwise improve an
area of such size and location as will provide a safe and suitable
place for the use of children awaiting school buses. In general, the
size of such area shall not be less than 100 square feet, and no
dimensions shall be less than eight feet. Such area shall be
included within the street or private road right-of-way and shall be
§ 195-23 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-23
187:613
§ 195-24. Lots and driveways.
maintained by the holder of fee title to the street or private road.
The layout and design shall be subject to Planning Board approval.
(7) Flood protection. The Planning Board shall review subdivision
proposals and other proposed new developments to assure that:
(a) All public utilities and facilities, such as a sewer, gas, electrical,
and water systems are located, elevated, and constructed to
minimize or eliminate flood damage, and
(b) Adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to
flood hazards.
(8) The Planning Board shall require new or replacement water supply
systems and/or sanitary sewerage systems to be designed to
minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems
and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, and require onsite
waste disposal systems to be located so as to avoid impairment
of them or contamination from them during flooding.
A. Lot and driveway arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that
there will be no foreseeable difficulty, for reasons of topography or
other conditions, in securing building permits to build on all lots in
compliance with the Zoning chapter,101 and the County Health
Department regulations, and in providing driveway access to buildings
on such lots from an approved street or private road in compliance with
the driveway requirements of the Zoning chapter. Subject to the
provision of access easements and a maintenance declaration or
agreement suitable to the City Attorney, which documents shall be filed
with the deeds to the subject lots, the Planning Board may approve the
use of a common driveway for a maximum of two lots, if the Board
determines that the use of said common driveway is more beneficial to
the safety, welfare or convenience of the proposed users of the driveway
and/or the people of the City in general than would be the case with
separate driveways.
B. Lot dimensions.
(1) Except as provided elsewhere in this chapter or otherwise
permitted by the City Council, lot area and dimensions shall comply
with at least the minimum standards of the Zoning chapter for the
district in which they are located. Where lots are more than double
the minimum required area, the Planning Board may require that
they be arranged so as to allow for further subdivision and the
opening of future streets where necessary to serve such potential
lots, all in compliance with the Zoning chapter and this chapter.
Where, in the opinion of the Planning Board, lots of larger than
101. Editor's Note: See Ch. 223, Zoning.
§ 195-23 BEACON CODE § 195-24
187:614
minimum size are required for purposes of proper drainage, water
supply, waste disposal, or the preservation of important ecological
features, the Board may require such oversized lots as a condition
of plat approval.
(2) Side lot lines shall generally be at right angles to street or private
road lines (or radial to curving street or private road lines) unless
the Planning Board allows a variation from this rule to give a better
street, private road or lot arrangement. Dimensions of corner lots
shall be large enough to allow for erection of buildings observing
the minimum front yard setback from both streets or private roads.
(3) Where a proposed subdivision includes an existing residence larger
in size than can appropriately be placed on a lot of the minimum
size permitted in the zoning district, the Planning Board may
require:
(a) That the lot be of such size and relationship to the proposed
street or private road system that the structure will be an
appropriate and harmonious part of the subdivision; and
(b) Restrictions such that the lot not be resubdivided in the future.
C. Access from major and collector streets. Lots shall not, in general,
derive access from a major or collector street, but shall front on a minor
interior street or private road. Where driveway access from a major or
collector street may be necessary for two adjoining lots, the Planning
Board may require that such lots be served by a common access drive in
order to limit the possible traffic hazard on such street. Any such
driveways, where permitted, shall be designed in such a way as to
provide adequate and convenient area for the turnaround of vehicles so
as to avoid requiring them to back into traffic on such streets and
private roads.
D. Double frontage lots. Lots fronting on two streets or private roads,
other than corner lots, shall be avoided except where deemed essential
by the Planning Board in order to provide separation of residential
development from major or collector streets, or to overcome problems
of topography or orientation. The Planning Board may require access
limitation and/or buffer landscaping for such double frontage lots
where the Board determines that such measures would be appropriate.
E. Water bodies. If a subdivision contains a water body, or portion thereof,
lot lines shall be drawn so as to distribute the entire ownership of the
water body among the fees of the adjacent lots, unless the Planning
Board approves an alternate plan whereby the ownership of and
responsibility for the safety of the water body is so placed that it will not
become a City responsibility.
F. Access across a watercourse. Where a watercourse separates the
buildable area of a lot from the street or private road by which it has
access, provision shall be made for the installation of a bridge, culvert
§ 195-24 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-24
187:615
or other drainage facility of a design approved by the Planning Board
based upon recommendation of the City Engineer, to provide
satisfactory access across such watercourse for fire, police and other
emergency equipment.
G. Subdivisions with land in two or more zoning districts or municipalities.
(1) In general, a lot should not be divided by a zoning district or
municipal boundary. If it is, however, necessary for a zoning district
boundary to cross a lot, such lot shall be designed so that it can be
readily developed in accordance with the standards of the more
restrictive zoning district. If it is necessary for a municipal
boundary line to cross a lot, the Planning Board may require
suitable legal agreements to assure that the two portions of the lot
will not be separated in the future and that the portion of the lot in
the adjoining municipality will not be used for any purpose that
would make it nonconforming if the entire lot were located within
the City of Beacon.
(2) Whenever a subdivision includes land in two or more zoning
districts and/or municipalities, the location of the zoning district
and/or municipal boundary line shall be shown on the plat and, in
addition, where zoning boundaries are involved, the following
notation shall be added: "Existing zoning boundaries as of
____________________, 20 ________."
H. Driveways. [Amended 9-4-2018 by L.L. No. 16-2018]
(1) All driveways shall be constructed in accordance with the
provisions set forth in § 100-6.
(2) All driveways shall be graded to the satisfaction of the Street
Superintendent and City Engineer prior to the surfacing of such
driveways.
(3) The driveway surface shall be constructed of a dust-free surface
material and shall be six inches in depth.
I. Common driveways.
(1) The developer and/or owner shall design and construct all common
driveways within the limits of the right-of-way with sufficient sight
distance and with a grade of no more than one-half inch per foot
from the curbline or edge of roadway pavement to a point 20 feet
from the curbline or edge of roadway pavement. The minimum
width of the driveway pavement at the curbline or street line shall
be 16 feet. At locations where individual driveways branch off from
the common driveway, these driveways shall be a minimum of 10
feet in width.
§ 195-24 BEACON CODE § 195-24
187:616
§ 195-25. Reservations and easements.
All reservations and easements shall be clearly indicated on the final
subdivision plat, along with appropriate notations indicating the rights
which exist with respect to each such reservation and/or easement.
(2) All common driveways shall be graded to the satisfaction of the
Street Superintendent and City Engineer prior to the surfacing of
such driveways.
(3) The common driveway surface shall be constructed of a dust-free
surface material and shall be six inches in depth.
(4) Common driveways shall be permitted in residential districts when
approved by the Planning Board. In determining the
appropriateness of a common driveway, the Planning Board shall
consider whether it will minimize adverse environmental effects on
the site, the length of the road, overall density, proposed offset of
driveways, road grades and center line radius, setback
requirements, and all other generally accepted planning standards.
A. Park reservations. [Amended 12-5-2011 by L.L. No. 14-2011]
(1) General standards. The Planning Board may require that land be
reserved within subdivisions for a park or parks suitably located for
playground or other recreational purposes. Such locations shall be
as designated on the City Development Plan or Official Map, or as
otherwise deemed appropriate by the Planning Board. Each
reservation shall be of suitable size, dimensions, topography and
general character, and shall have adequate street or private road
access, for the particular purpose or purposes envisioned by the
Planning Board. The area shall be shown and marked on the plat as
"Reserved for Park Purposes."
(2) Minimum size. The Planning Board may require the reservation of
up to 10% of the area of the subdivision for recreation purposes. In
general, it is desirable that land reserved for park and playground
purposes have an area of at least one acre. The Board may require
that such areas be located at a suitable place on the edge of the
subdivision so that additional land may be added at such time as
the adjacent land is subdivided.
(3) Ownership of park areas. The ownership of reservations for park
purposes shall be clearly indicated on the plat and established in a
manner satisfactory to the Planning Board so as to assure their
proper future continuation and maintenance. When the Planning
Board requires that an area for park, playground or recreational
purposes be reserved on the subdivision plat, such requirement
shall not constitute an acceptance by the City of such area.
(4) Cash payment in lieu of reservation. Where the Planning Board
determines that a suitable park or parks of adequate size cannot be
§ 195-24 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 195-25
187:617
properly located in a subdivision, or where such a reservation
is otherwise not appropriate or practical, the Board, at its sole
discretion, may require, as a condition to approval of any such plat,
a payment to the City of a sum determined for such cases by the
City Council.
(5) Referral. In the event the Planning Board intends to require a
reservation of parkland, the Planning Board should request a
report and recommendation from the City Council as to the
reservation of such land for park or recreation purposes.
(6) Resubdivision. In the event of a resubdivision of a plat, nothing
shall preclude the additional reservation of parkland or money
donated in lieu thereof.
B. Widening or realignment of existing streets. Where a subdivision
borders an existing street which is narrower than the recommended
right-of-way width as specified for such streets in this chapter, or where
a subdivision borders an existing street planned for widening or
realignment in such a way as to require the use of some land in the
subdivision, the Planning Board may require the subdivision plat to
show such areas which shall be marked "Reserved for Street
Realignment (or Widening) Purposes." Land reserved for such purposes
may not be counted in satisfying yard or area requirements of the
Zoning chapter.102
C. Utility and drainage easements.
(1) Where topography or other conditions are such as to make
impractical the inclusion of utilities or drainage facilities within
street or private road right-of-way, perpetual unobstructed
easements of at least 20 feet in width shall be provided for such
utilities or drainage facilities across properties outside the street or
private road lines and with satisfactory access to the street or
private road. Drainage easements shall extend from the street or
private road to the watercourse or other drainage facility, and shall
convey to the holder of fee title of the street or private road, the
perpetual right to discharge stormwater runoff from the street or

premises by means of pipes, culverts, or ditches, or a combination
thereof, together with the right to enter said premises for the
purpose of making such installations and doing such maintenance

secured in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney and suitable for
recording in the Office of the County Clerk.
D. Slope easements. Where determined appropriate by the Planning
Board, said Board may permit an embankment alongside a proposed
street or private road to extend beyond the normal right-of-way of such
street or private road provided a slope easement is granted, conveying
to the holder of fee title of the street or private road the right to enter
the premises for the purpose of maintaining such slope. Where the
embankment slope is located on private land outside the subdivision,
such easement shall be permitted only where the appropriate rights
have been secured in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney and
suitable for recording in the Office of the County Clerk.
E. Sight easements. Sight easements shall be provided across all street or
private road corners, outside the street or private road right-of-way,
within the triangular area formed by the nearest edges of street or
private road pavement and a straight line between two points each 25
feet back from the theoretical intersection of the edges of such
pavement prolonged. The easements shall provide that the holder of fee
title to the abutting streets or private roads shall have the right to enter
the easement area for the purpose of clearing, pruning or regrading so
as to maintain a clear line of sight in either direction across such
triangular area between an observer's eye 3.5 feet above the pavement
surface on one street or private road and an object one foot above the
pavement surface on the other. The initial establishment of clear sight
lines within the sight easement area shall be the responsibility of the
subdivider.
F. Easements for pedestrian access. The Planning Board may require, in
order to facilitate pedestrian access from streets or private roads to
schools, parks or neighboring areas, the reservation of perpetual
unobstructed easements of at least 20 feet in width for such purposes
and the construction of walkways thereon.
A. Preservation of existing features. Existing features which would add
value to residential development, such as large trees, watercourses and
falls, historic spots and similar irreplaceable assets, should be
preserved, insofar as possible, through harmonious design of the
subdivision.
B. Self-imposed restrictions. The subdivider may place restrictions on any
of the land contained within the subdivision which are greater than
those required by the Zoning chapter.103 Such restrictions shall be
indicated on the final subdivision plat.

187:619
C. Subdivisions including land zoned for business. If a proposed
subdivision includes land that is zoned for business purposes, and if
such land is not restricted against business use by the imposition of
deed restrictions by the owner, the layout of the subdivision with
respect to such land shall make such provision as the Planning Board
may require for safe and convenient access to such automobile parking
and loading and unloading spaces as may be required by the Zoning
chapter, or otherwise for safe and convenient service access to such
land.
D. Premature subdivision. The Planning Board shall investigate, identify
and report to the City Council any subdivision within the City, a plat for
which has been placed on file in the Office of the Dutchess County Clerk
prior to October 6, 1958, which is a premature subdivision as defined
herein. One copy of such report shall be sent, by certified mail, to the
property owner or owners involved, at the address indicated on the
City's assessment records, and the owner or owners invited to meet and
discuss with the Planning Board the possible redesign of their
subdivision. Another copy of that report shall be sent to the Building
Inspector. Upon its receipt of the Planning Board's report, the City
Council may redesignate such a subdivision as premature.
E. Modification of standards. The Planning Board may modify the specified
requirements in any individual case where, in the Board's judgment,
such modification is in the public interest or will avoid the imposition of
unnecessary individual hardship.
F. Penalties for violation.
(1) Any person, partnership or corporation who shall violate any
provision of this chapter, or who shall alter or use any land in
violation of any statement or plan submitted and approved
hereunder, or who shall knowingly assist therein, shall be liable to a
fine of not less than $500 and not more than $100,000 or
imprisonment not exceeding 15 days, or both such fine and
imprisonment. Each week's continued violation shall constitute a
separate and additional violation.
(2) In addition, where construction subject to a building permit is
involved, the Building Inspector shall, at the recommendation of
the City Engineer, issue an order to stop all work on the project or
revoke the building permit, as may be necessary or appropriate to
the situation.
(3) No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any new
construction on the property on which occurred any violation of
this chapter unless and until the provisions of this section have
been complied with.
(4) In addition to any other penalty authorized by this section, any
person, partnership or corporation shall be required to restore the
§ 195-26 BEACON CODE § 195-26
187:620
site to the condition existing prior to the violation or to bear the
expense of such restoration.
(5) The remedies contained within this chapter shall not be exclusive,
but shall be in addition to any other remedy provided by law, so
long as not inconsistent herewith, nor shall the invoking of any
remedy or procedure contained within this chapter preclude the
pursuit of any and all other remedies, and the same are intended to
be cumulative.

adjusted homestead base proportion of 67.84632 for the City of Beacon.
The State Board of Equalization and Assessment has also computed and
certified in accordance with the provisions of the Real Property Tax Law,
§ 1905, a current percentage provided to the chief executive officer of the
approved assessing unit for the City of Beacon which equals the percentage
that the estimated taxable market value of the homestead class constitutes
of the total estimated taxable market value of all real property in the City of
Beacon. This adjusted homestead base proportion and current percentage
shall be used to determine the locally adjusted homestead proportion as
authorized in § 199-7 of this article.
§ 199-7. Multiplication factor.
In accordance with the provisions of Real Property Tax Law, § 1903,
Subdivision 2(a)(ii), the multiplication factor to be utilized in computing
the locally adjusted homestead proportion shall be 75%. Pursuant to the
formula set forth in that section, the adjusted homestead base proportion of
67.84632 is hereby altered to 68.89. This locally adjusted proportion for the
City of Beacon shall be used for the purpose of the Real Property Tax Law,
§ 1903, until a new adjusted homestead base proportion is certified by the
State Board of Equalization and Assessment.

Exemption for Historic Properties
[Adopted 3-2-1998 by L.L. No. 1-1998]
§ 199-10. Exemption granted.
A. Legislative intent.
(1) This real property tax exemption for historic properties is being
enacted in order to achieve the following goals: to increase
incentives for property owners in historic districts to invest in the
upkeep and rehabilitation of properties; to provide an incentive for
the restoration and rehabilitation of commercial structures which
qualify as landmarks in order to provide financial advantages, not
available elsewhere in the county at this time, which may help to
attract and retain businesses in the City of Beacon; to assist
homeowners who are interested in restoring their own properties,
but who may not be able to afford to do so when faced with
potential increases in taxation as the result of alterations which
would qualify for this exemption; to provide financial incentives for
investment in low-income residential neighborhoods which may
contain landmarked buildings or districts designated within the
area; and to provide a concrete benefit to offset the possible
financial disadvantage of owning historically or architecturally
significant properties which are subject to the regulations of the
City's Local Landmarks Ordinance.108
(2) The City of Beacon real property tax exemption is intended to apply
to alterations or rehabilitation of historic property as authorized
pursuant to §§ 96-a and 119-aa through 119-dd of the General
Municipal Law and § 444-a of the Real Property Tax Law and all
other powers granted to the City of Beacon to provide such
exemptions.
(3) This article is intended to create a real property tax exemption that
preserves or increases the historic character of real property
located within the City of Beacon.
B. Real property within the City of Beacon altered or rehabilitated
subsequent to the effective date of this article shall be exempt from City
real property and special ad valorem levies, subject to and in
accordance with the schedule set forth in § 199-10B(1) and conditions
outlined in § 199-10B(1) and C.
(1) Historic property which shall be defined hereafter shall be exempt
from taxation to the extent of any increase in value attributable to
such alteration or rehabilitation pursuant to the following schedule.

(2) No such exemption shall be granted for such alterations or
rehabilitation unless all of the following criteria are met:
(a) Such property must be historic, which shall mean that the
property has been designated as a landmark or is a property
that is located in and contributes to the character of a
designated historic district, created by a local law which was
passed pursuant to § 96-a or 119-dd of the General Municipal
Law.
(b) Alteration or rehabilitation of exteriors and public interiors (to
the extent that public interiors are regulated by the local
preservation law) of historic property must meet guidelines
and review standards established in the local preservation law.
(c) Alterations and rehabilitation of exteriors and public interiors

a one- or two-family dwelling to a multiple dwelling as
defined in the City Code of the City of Beacon, and any
increase in value resulting from such conversion, shall not
qualify for the exemption; or
[4] The project returns to use a building which has not been
used for a permissible purpose under applicable zoning
ordinances for a continuous period of at least two years.
(e) Alterations or rehabilitation must be commenced subsequent
to the effective date of this article.

owners of such historic real property on a form prescribed by the State
Equalization and Assessment Board. The application shall be filed with
the City Assessor on or before the appropriate taxable status date
covering City real property.

the applicant is entitled to an exemption pursuant to this section. The

Exemption for Volunteer Firefighters and Ambulance Workers
[Adopted 12-3-2007 by L.L. No. 16-2007]
§ 199-35. Statutory authority.
The New York State Legislature has, heretofore, amended the Real Property
Tax Law (RPTL) to authorize municipalities to permit enrolled volunteer
firefighters and volunteer ambulance workers to be eligible for a real
property tax exemption as is more particularly set forth in RPTL § 466-c.
§ 199-36. Legislative intent.
The Legislature recognizes the role of the volunteer firefighters and

ARTICLE X
Utility Tax
[Adopted 12-5-2011 by L.L. No. 15-2011]
§ 199-40. Legislative intent.
By § 20-b of the General City Laws, as added by Chapter 321 of the Laws
of 1937, and as amended by Chapter 245 of the Laws of 1942, cities are
authorized to enact local laws imposing a tax such as was imposed by
§ 186-a of the Tax Law. Pursuant to such authority, this article is modeled
upon said § 186-a. It is intended thereby and likewise by this article,
enacted pursuant to the above-mentioned authority, to impose a tax on
utility services, whether rendered by utilities in the strict sense or not, and
whether such services are in the main or incidental part of their business
and regardless of whether the public streets are used in any manner.
Accordingly, such a utility is defined for the purposes of the tax as including
every person subject to the supervision of the Department of Public Service
and every other person furnishing utility services. It is intended to include
persons and corporations which are directly in competition with ordinary
utilities, such as landlords and submeterers, who buy their services from
other utilities and in turn resell such services. For that reason, the tax
is imposed in receipts from sales to ultimate consumers. Receipts from
the sale of such utility services to submeterers are not taxed, but receipts
of submeterers from their own customers are intended to be taxed. Any
other construction would result in a complete exemption from taxation of
utility services sold or furnished by this particular method. Furthermore, it
is believed that submeterers have common characteristics that distinguish
them from other businesses and justify the conclusion that the method,
character and nature of their business, in this aspect, is substantially similar
to the business of an ordinary utility and requires similar treatment for the
purposes of the tax. This conclusion is strongly fortified by the fact that such
landlords and submeterers are in direct competition with ordinary utilities
and hence should bear similar tax burdens in order to avoid inequality of
treatment.
§ 199-41. Imposition of tax.
Pursuant to the authority granted by § 20-b of the General City Law of the
State of New York, a tax equal to 1% of its gross income from and after
July 1, 1937, is hereby imposed upon every utility doing business in the City
of Beacon which is subject to the supervision of the State Department of
Public Service, which has a gross income for the 12 months ending May
31 in excess of $500, except motor carriers or brokers subject to such
supervision under Transportation Law § 240 et seq., and a tax equal to 1%
of its gross operating income is hereby imposed from and after July 1, 1937,
upon every other utility doing business in the City of Beacon which has a
gross operating income for the 12 months ending May 31 in excess of $500,
which taxes shall have application only within the territorial limits of the
City of Beacon and shall be in addition to any and all other taxes and fees
imposed by any other provisions of law for the same period. Such taxes shall
§ 199-40 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 199-41
187:655
not be imposed on any transactions originating or consummated outside of
the territorial limits of the City of Beacon, notwithstanding that some act be
necessarily performed with respect to such transaction within such limits.
§ 199-42. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
GROSS INCOME  Means and includes receipts received in or by reason of
any sale, conditional or otherwise (except sales hereinafter referred to with
respect to which it is provided that profits from the sale shall be included
in gross income), made or service rendered for ultimate consumption or use
by the purchaser in the City of Beacon, including cash, credits and property
of any kind or nature (whether or not such sale is made or such service
is rendered for profit), without any deduction therefrom on account of the
cost of the property sold, the cost of the materials used, labor or services
or other costs, interest or discount paid or any other expense whatsoever;
also profits from the sale of securities; also profits from the sale of real
property growing out of the ownership or use of or interest in such property;
also profit from the sale of personal property (other than property of a
kind which would properly be included in the inventory of the taxpayer
if on hand at the close of the period for which a return is made); also
receipts from interest, dividends and royalties derived from sources within
the City of Beacon, other than such as are received from a corporation a
majority of whose voting stock is owned by the taxpaying utility without any
deduction therefrom for any expenses whatsoever incurred in connection
with the receipt thereof; and also profits from any transaction (except sales
for resale and rentals) within the City of Beacon whatsoever.
GROSS OPERATING INCOME  Means and includes receipts received
in or by reason of any sale, conditional or otherwise, made for ultimate
consumption or use by the purchaser of gas, electricity, steam, water,
refrigeration, telephony or telegraphy, or in or by reason of the furnishing
for such consumption or use of gas, electric, steam, water, refrigerator,
telephone or telegraph service in the City of Beacon, including cash, credits
and property of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom on
account of the cost of the property sold, the cost of materials used, labor
or services or other costs, interest or discount paid or any other expenses
whatsoever.
PERSONS  Means persons, corporations, companies, associations, jointstock
associations, co-partnerships, estates, assignees of rents, any person

§ 199-45. Due dates for payment.

pay to the Director of Finance the tax imposed by this article for the period
covered by such return. Such tax shall be due and payable at the time of
§ 199-42 SLAUGHTERHOUSES § 199-45
187:657
filing the return or, if a return is not filed when due, on the last day on which
the return is required to be filed.
§ 199-46. Insufficient returns; determination of tax; interest and
penalties.
In case any return filed pursuant to this article shall be insufficient or
unsatisfactory to the Director of Finance, and if a corrected or sufficient
return is not filed within 20 days after the same is required by notice
from the Director of Finance, or if no return is made for any period,
the Director of Finance shall determine the amount of tax due from such
information as he is able to obtain, and, if necessary, may estimate the
tax on the basis of external indices or otherwise. The Director of Finance
shall give notice of such determination to the person liable for such tax.
Such determination shall finally and irrevocably fix such tax unless the
person against whom it is assessed shall, within 30 days after the giving
of notice of such determination, apply to the Director of Finance for a
hearing, or unless the Director of Finance of his own motion shall reduce
the same. After such hearing, the Director of Finance shall give notice of
his decision to the person liable for the tax. Any final determination by the
Director of Finance of the amount of any tax payable hereunder shall be
reviewable for error, illegality or unconstitutionality or any other reason
whatsoever, by a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law
and Rules if application is made to the Supreme Court within 30 after the
giving of a notice of such final determination; provided, however, that any
such proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules shall
not be instituted unless the amount of any tax sought to be reviewed with
such interest and penalties thereon, as may be provided for by local law or
regulation, shall be first deposited and an undertaking filed in such amount
and with such sureties as a Justice of the Supreme Court shall approve,
to the effect that if such proceeding be dismissed or the tax confirmed,
the petitioner will pay all costs and charges which may accrue in the
prosecution of such proceeding.
§ 199-47. Mailing of notice.
Any notice authorized or required under the provisions of this article may
be given by mailing the same to the person for whom it is intended, in a
postpaid envelope, addressed to such person at the address given by him
in the last return filed by him under this article or, if no return has been
filed, then to such address as may be obtainable. The mailing of such notice
shall be presumptive evidence of the receipt of the same by the person to
whom addressed. Any period of time which is determined according to the
provisions of this article by the giving of notice shall commence to run from
the date of mailing of such notice.
§ 199-48. Penalty for failure to file; exceptions.
Any person failing to file a return or corrected return, or to pay any tax or
any portion thereof, within the time required by this article shall be subject
§ 199-45 BEACON CODE § 199-48
187:658
to a penalty of 5% of the amount of tax due, plus 1% of such tax for each
month of delay or fraction thereof, excepting the first month, after such
return was required to be filed or such tax became due; but the Director
of Finance, if satisfied that the delay was excusable may remit all or any
portion of such penalty.
§ 199-49. Refunds.
If, within one year from the payment of any tax or penalty, the payer thereof
shall make application for a refund thereof and the Director of Finance or
the court shall determine that such tax or penalty or any portion thereof was
erroneously or illegally collected, the Director of Finance shall refund the
amount so determined. For like cause and within the same period, a refund
may be so made on the initiative of the Director of Finance. However, no
refund shall be made of a tax or penalty paid pursuant to a determination
of the Director of Finance as hereinbefore provided unless the Director of
Finance, after a hearing as hereinbefore provided, or of his own motion,
shall have reduced the tax or penalty or it shall have been established
in a proceeding under Article 78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules of
the State of New York that such determination was erroneous or illegal.
All refunds shall be made out of moneys collected under this article. An
application for a refund, made as hereinbefore provided, shall be deemed
an application for the revision of any tax or penalty complained of and the
Director of Finance may receive additional evidence with respect thereto.
After making this determination, the Director of Finance shall give notice
thereof to the person interested, and he shall be entitled to an order to
review such determination under said Article 78, subject to the provisions
hereinbefore contained relating to the granting of such an order.
§ 199-50. Tax constitutes part of operating costs.
The tax imposed by this article shall be charged and be paid by the utility
and shall not be added as a separate item to bills rendered by the utility
to customers or others but shall constitute a part of the operating costs of
such utility.
§ 199-51. Failure to pay tax or penalty.
Whenever any person shall fail to pay any tax or penalty imposed by
this article, the City Attorney shall, upon the request of the Director of
Finance, bring an action to enforce payment of the same. The proceeds of
any judgment obtained in any such action shall be paid to the Director of
Finance. Each such tax and penalty shall be a lien upon the property of the
person liable to pay the same, in the same manner and to the same extent
that the tax and penalty imposed by § 186-a of the Tax Law is made a lien.

the court may require the production of, and may admit in evidence, so

General Provisions
§ 200-1. Preamble. [Added 12-20-2010 by L.L. No. 19-2010111]
The City Council of the City of Beacon finds that suitable public
transportation is lacking within the City of Beacon and that transportation
by taxicab within the city limits is an important and viable form of
transportation for its residents and visitors. The City Council recognizes
that § 151 of the New York State Transportation Law permits the municipal
regulation of taxi service which is conducted wholly within municipal
boundaries. Therefore, the City Council further finds that it is necessary to
regulate and license a taxi service conducted wholly within the boundaries
of the City of Beacon for the purpose of maintaining order, enforcing laws,
protecting property, and caring for the safety, health, comfort, and general
welfare of the inhabitants and visitors to the City of Beacon. This chapter
does not seek to regulate, in any way, taxi service which is not conducted
wholly within the City of Beacon's municipal boundaries, except that
compliance with §§ 200-17 to 200-19 and 200-21 to 200-26 shall apply to all
taxicabs operating in the City whether the fares be transported solely within
the City or outside of the City.

following words shall have the meanings given to them by this section.

and entities shall be considered to include the masculine and the feminine,
and the singular and the plural, as the sense and neutral application thereof

MEDALLION  The metal plate, not exceeding six inches in diameter,

Booting and Towing of Vehicles
[Added 2-6-2012 by L.L. No. 2-2012]
§ 211-35. Legislative findings.
§ 211-36. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BOOT  A device or lock which is affixed to the wheel of a motor vehicle,
preventing the wheel from rotating and, thereby, immobilizing the vehicle;
may also be referred to herein as a "booting device."
BOOTING  The act of affixing a boot to a motor vehicle.
IMPOUND LOT  A yard, garage or storage facility capable of storing
motor vehicles safely and which is made secure by the installation of fences,
walls and other security devices designed to protect vehicles being stored
therein, subject to additional requirements set forth in § 211-40C of this
article.
MOTOR VEHICLE  Shall be defined the same as §§ 79-2 and 145-2 of the
Beacon City Code and interpreted in conformity with the New York State
Vehicle and Traffic Laws.
A. It is hereby declared and found that the booting and subsequent towing
of vehicles in the City of Beacon involves matters affecting the public
interest and that certain improper practices related thereto should be
subject to regulation for the purpose of protecting and safeguarding the
public health, safety and welfare and to prevent and protect the public
from fraud, abuses and unnecessary inconvenience.
B. The City has received ongoing complaints that insufficient signage is
posted in parking lots to warn the public that vehicles may be booted
and then towed if parked improperly or illegally. Other complaints have
been made concerning alleged abuses by towing company personnel.
The City finds that appropriate business practices should include giving
adequate warning to the general public of the consequences of parking
improperly or illegally on privately owned real property, standardized
penalties for violations, and giving the vehicle operators an opportunity
to correct what might otherwise be an innocent mistake.
C. The City therefore desires to regulate booting services and certain
towing services within the City through licensing of the businesses
providing such services and establishing guidelines for the property
owners/operators who employ them. These regulations are hereby
enacted to safeguard the public against future fraud and improper
booting practices and certain towing practices and to better serve the
overall health, safety, welfare and good order of the City of Beacon and
its inhabitants.
§ 211-35 VEHICLE REPAIR AND SALES § 211-36
210:755
PRIVATELY OWNED REAL PROPERTY  Real property owned by an
individual, firm, association, joint venture, partnership, corporation, or
other legal entity whatsoever, and shall include, without limitation, the
parking lots, parking areas, driveways and sidewalks of shopping centers,
parking garages, apartment complexes, condominium complexes, and other
land used for multifamily or commercial purposes, but shall not include the
driveways or parking areas of private homes which are not held open to the
public.
TOW  The lawful moving of a vehicle which has been parked illegally
or improperly on the privately owned real property of another or which
has been disabled, abandoned or improperly or illegally parked on a public
street.
TOWING COMPANY  Any business or person lawfully engaged in the
practice of towing vehicles for a fee in the City of Beacon. For purposes
of this article, "towing company" shall also include any business or person
lawfully engaged in the practice of booting motor vehicles for a fee in the
City of Beacon.
TOW TRUCK  A motor vehicle used for towing, usually equipped with a
crane, winch, tow bar, push plate, flat bed or other device or feature used
to push or pull another motor vehicle.
§ 211-37. Registration requirements.
A. Towing company registration. No towing company shall provide booting
services or tow a vehicle that has been booted within the City of Beacon
without first applying for and receiving a license from the City.
(1) Application. All towing companies wishing to provide booting
services and/or subsequent towing services within the City of
Beacon shall complete an application filed with the office of the
City Clerk. Such applications shall include the following items and
such other information as the City Clerk deems necessary:
(a) The name of the towing company;
(b) The postal and e-mail address and telephone number of the
towing company's primary place of business;
(c) The names, postal and e-mail addresses and telephone
numbers of the owners, managers, and chief operating officers
of the towing company;
(d) Copies of the current licenses/identification cards of all
employees of the towing company whose job it shall be to tow
or boot motor vehicles, subject to the additional requirement
that the list of employees held by the City must be kept current
and up-to-date by the towing company;
(e) Certificates of insurance naming the City of Beacon as a
certificate holder entitled to notice of cancellation or
§ 211-36 BEACON CODE § 211-37
210:756
§ 211-38. Fees.
nonrenewal and evidencing public liability insurance covering
personal injury, property damage, fire and theft, held by the
towing company and issued by an insurance carrier licensed to
do business in New York State; and
(f) Copies of the signed contracts for towing and/or booting
services executed between the applicant towing company and
the owners/operators of any privately owned real property that
shall receive such services, provided that the towing company
is also responsible for furnishing the City with copies of all
contracts for towing and/or booting services executed
following issuance of a license pursuant to this article.
(2) Acknowledgment. All applications filed with the City shall have an
attached acknowledgment, signed by an owner, manager, or chief
officer of the towing company, stating that the towing company
understands and is in compliance with all local and state laws
concerning towing and booting operations.
B. Annual registration. Towing companies must register/reregister with
the City of Beacon on an annual basis, and fees for towing licenses and
booting licenses shall be assessed and paid separately in accordance
with the City's fee schedule.
C. No license granted pursuant to this article may be transferred to
another party or individual.
A. Towing fees. The maximum fee that can be assessed against the owner/
operator of a motor vehicle for towing of the vehicle from privately
owned real property is $75, plus applicable taxes. Under no
circumstances shall the owner/operator of a motor vehicle be charged
more than this amount.
B. Storage fees. The maximum fee that can be assessed against the owner/
operator of a motor vehicle that has been towed and stored at an
impound lot is $15/day. Under no circumstances shall the owner/
operator of a motor vehicle be charged more than this rate.
C. Prohibition on hookup fees. A towing company may not charge the
owner/operator of a motor vehicle for merely attaching a motor vehicle
to a tow truck where the vehicle is not subsequently removed from the
premises. This provision does not prevent a towing company from
collecting a fee for attachment of a booting device as defined in Article
V of this chapter.
D. Booting fees. The maximum fee that can be assessed against the owner/
operator of a motor vehicle for attachment/removal of a booting device
is $25, plus applicable taxes. Under no circumstances, shall the owner/
operator of a motor vehicle be charged more than this amount.

210:757
§ 211-39. Grant of permission.
§ 211-40. Limitations on towing and booting.
E. Prohibition on double fees for booting. The fee charged for attachment
and removal of a booting device to a motor vehicle is a one-time charge,
and a booting company may not charge for attachment and removal of a
booting device separately.
A. The owner/operator of privately owned real property may have a motor
vehicle towed from the premises or booted where such motor vehicle is
parked improperly or illegally on the premises and where the applicable

(e) The Department shall have on file a list of private contractors
who are certified backflow device testers. The owner is
responsible for all costs associated with the installation and
testing of any backflow prevention device.
(f) The Department will begin initial premises inspections to
determine the nature of existing or potential hazards following
the approval of this program by the City Council of the City of
Beacon. Initial focus will be on high-hazard industries and
commercial premises.
(2) Owners.
(a) The owners shall be responsible for the elimination or
protection of all cross-connections on their premises.
(b) The owners, after having been informed by a letter from the
Department, shall at their expense install, maintain, and test,
or have tested, any and all backflow prevention devices on
their premises. The owners shall be responsible for all costs
§ 219-12 BEACON CODE § 219-12
210:774
associated with the installation and testing of backflow
prevention devices.
(c) After the Department determines the type of backflow
prevention device, if any, required and approves the backflow
prevention device, the owner shall submit an application to the
NYSDOH to obtain a permit to construct the approved
backflow prevention device. The work shall be completed
within 90 days from receipt of the permit. Failure or refusal or
inability on the part of the owner to install said device within
90 days shall constitute grounds for discontinuing water
service until such device has been properly installed.
(d) After completion of installation of the backflow prevention
device, the owner shall apply for a completed works permit by
submitting to the NYSDOH a certification from an engineer
which states that the installation of the work is in compliance
with the approved plans and certification from an approved
tester of backflow prevention devices, that the installation was
tested and is working as designed and approved and in
accordance with the intent of these regulations.
(e) The owner shall submit to the City of Beacon Water and Sewer
Department and Building Department all certifications
submitted to the NYSDOH, including the certification that the
installation of the approved backflow prevention device is in
compliance with the approved plans and the certification that
the installation was tested and is working as designed.
(f) The owners shall correct any malfunction of the backflow
prevention device which is revealed by periodic testing.
(g) The owners shall inform the Department of any proposed or
modified cross-connections of which the owners are aware but
have not been found by the Department.
(h) The owners shall not install a bypass around any backflow
prevention device unless there is a backflow prevention device
of the same type on the bypass. Owners who cannot shut down
operation for testing of the device(s) must supply additional
devices necessary to allow testing to take place.
(i) The owners shall install only backflow prevention devices
which are shown on an NYSDOH list of approved backflow
prevention devices.
(j) Any owners having a private well or other private water source
must obtain approval from the Department if the well or source
is cross-connected to the Department's system. Permission to
cross-connect may be denied by the Department. The owner
may be required to install a backflow prevention device at the
§ 219-12 VEHICLE REPAIR AND SALES § 219-12
210:775
service entrance if a private water source is maintained, even
if it is not cross-connected to the Department's system.
(k) In the event that the owners install plumbing to provide
potable water for domestic purposes which is on the
Department's side of the backflow prevention device, such
plumbing must have its own backflow prevention device
installed.
(l) The owners shall be responsible for the payment of all permit
fees, penalties, annual or semiannual device testing, retesting
in the case that the device fails to operate correctly, and
second reinspections for noncompliance with Department and/
or Department of Health requirements.
G. Determination of type of backflow protection device.
(1) Categories; rating system; regulation.
(a) An acceptable backflow prevention device must be installed in
every service connection to a facility. Three categories shall be
considered when determining the degree of hazard posed by a
facility and making the subsequent determination of the type of
protection device required. The City of Beacon recognizes the
threat to the public water system arising from crossconnections.
All threats will be classified by degree of hazard
and will require the installation of approved reduced pressure
principle backflow prevention devices, reduced pressure zone
assembly, (RPZA) or double check valve assembly (DCVA). The
considerations are:
[1] Use, toxicity and availability of contaminants.
[2] Availability of a supplementary supply of water.
[3] Firefighting system evaluation.
(b) Based on these considerations the water supply operator and/
or the City Engineer shall rate a facility as hazardous,
aesthetically objectionable or nonhazardous.
[1] A hazardous facility must be contained through the use of
an RPZA or properly designed air gap.
[2] An aesthetically objectionable facility must be contained
through the use of a DCV, RPZA, or air gap.
[3] Nonhazardous facilities should be protected through an
internal plumbing control program to ensure that
plumbing cross-connections are adequately protected or
eliminated; or through the use of a DCVA, RPZA or air gap.
§ 219-12 BEACON CODE § 219-12
210:776
(2) The Water Superintendent and/or the City Engineer as designated
by the City Council shall determine the type of device required for
each property and facility. In making this determination, the water
supply operator may utilize the Sample List of Facilities Requiring
Backflow Prevention, prepared by the NYSDOH and, if necessary,
shall consult with the DCDOH.
(3) Cross-connection control by facility type.
(a) Hazardous types of facilities which shall require installation of
an approved reduced pressure zone assembly (RPZA) or air
gap in the service connection to the public water distribution
system include but are not limited to:
[1] Sewage and industrial wastewater treatment plants and
pumping stations and sewer flushers.
[2] Paper manufacturing or processing, dye plants, petroleum
processing, printing plants, chemical manufacturing or
processing, industrial fluid systems, steam generation,
rubber processing and tanneries.
[3] Canneries, breweries, food processing, milk processing,
ice manufacturing, meat packers, poultry processing and
rendering companies.
[4] Hospitals, clinics, laboratories, veterinary hospitals,
mortuaries and embalmers.
[5] Metal plating, photo processing, laundries, commercial
car washes, commercial refrigeration systems and drycleaning
establishments.
[6] Commercial greenhouses, spraying and irrigation systems
using weedicides, herbicides and exterminators.
[7] Boiler systems, cooling towers or internal firefighter
systems using conditioners, inhibitors and corrosion
control chemicals.
[8] Residential units with lawn and irrigation systems with
chemical injection.
[9] Residential units or facilities with service provided by both
the village water distribution system and private well or
water supply.
(b) Aesthetically objectionable types of facilities which shall
require installation of an approved double check valve, RPZA
or air gap in the service connection of the public water
distribution system are those which include but are not limited
to:
§ 219-12 VEHICLE REPAIR AND SALES § 219-12
210:777
[1] Customer fire-protection loops and fire-storage tanks with
no chemical additives.
[2] High-temperature potable water.
[3] Utilization for food-grade dyes.
[4] Complex plumbing systems in commercial buildings, such
as but not limited to beauty salons, churches, apartment
buildings, gas stations, supermarkets, nursing homes,
construction sites and carnivals.
[5] Residential units with lawn and irrigation systems.
(c) It is not possible to list every circumstance and facility type
that may be encountered by the Department while evaluating
all users. The Department, while evaluating a facility, will rely
on experience, assistance from local Health Department
officials and the Cross-Connection Control Program Manual.
H. Existing in-use backflow prevention devices. Any existing backflow
prevention device shall be allowed by the Department to continue in
service unless the degree of hazard is such as to supersede the
effectiveness of the present backflow prevention device, or result in an
unreasonable risk to the public health. Where the degree of hazard has
increased, as in the case of a residential installation converting to a
business establishment, any existing backflow prevention device must
be upgraded to a reduced-pressure-principle device, or a reducedpressure-
principle device must be installed in the event that no
backflow prevention device was present.
I. Periodic testing.
(1) All testers of backflow prevention devices shall be approved by the
NYSDOH pursuant to Section 1.13 of Part 5 of the New York State
Sanitary Code, 10 NYCRR Section 5-1.31.
(2) The testing of backflow prevention devices shall be performed on
an annual basis by the owner of any system requiring the same, and
the cost of such testing shall be borne by the owner of the system.
The testing procedures shall conform to the requirements of the
NYSDOH and the DCDOH. Test results shall be submitted to the
Department within 30 days of the completion of such testing. Late
submissions of annual test results shall be subject to an
administrative processing fee in the amount of $25.
(3) Any backflow prevention device which fails during a periodic test
will be repaired or replaced. When repairs are necessary, upon
completion of the repair the device will be retested at the owner's
expense to ensure correct operation. High-hazard situations will
not be allowed to continue unprotected if the backflow prevention
device fails the test and cannot be repaired immediately. In other
§ 219-12 BEACON CODE § 219-12
210:778
situations, a compliance date of not more than 30 days after the
test date will be established. The owner is responsible for spare
parts, repair tools or a replacement device. Parallel installation
of two devices is an effective means of the owner ensuring
uninterrupted water service during testing or repair of devices and
is strongly recommended when the owner desires such continuity.
(4) Backflow prevention devices will be tested more frequently than
specified above in cases where there is a history of test failures and
the water supply operator feels that, due to the degree of hazard
involved, additional testing is warranted. Cost of the additional
testing will be borne by the owner.
(5) Testing is not required when fixture isolation is achieved with the
utilization of a nontestable backflow prevention device.
J. Residential dual check assembly.
(1) Effective the date of the acceptance of this cross-connection
control program for the City of Beacon, all new residential
buildings, which includes one-family and two-family dwellings, will
be required to install a residential dual check assembly
immediately downstream of the water meter. Installation of this
residential dual check assembly on the retrofit basis on existing
service lines will be instituted at a time and at a potential cost to
the homeowner as deemed necessary by the Department.
(2) The owners must be aware that installation of a residential dual
check assembly results in a potential closed plumbing system
within the residence. As such, provisions may have to be made by
the owners to provide for thermal expansion within the closed loop
system, i.e., the installation of thermal expansion devices and/or
pressure relief valves.
K. Strainers. The Department strongly recommends that all new retrofit
installations of reduced-pressure-principle devices and double check
valve backflow prevention devices include the installation of strainers
located immediately upstream of the backflow prevention device. The
installation of strainers will preclude the fouling of the backflow
prevention devices due to both foreseen and unforeseen circumstances
occurring to the water supply system, such as water main repairs,
water main breaks, fires, periodic cleaning and flushing of mains, etc.
These occurrences may stir up debris within the water main that will
cause fouling of backflow prevention devices installed without the
benefit of strainers.
L. Penalties for offenses; corrective action.
(1) Any person violating any provision of this chapter shall be subject
to a penalty as prescribed in § 1-3.
§ 219-12 VEHICLE REPAIR AND SALES § 219-12
210:779
§ 219-13. Alterations required by ground elevation changes.
[Amended 12-5-2016 by L.L. No. 17-2016]
In the event that a change in ground elevation leaves a service pipe
insufficiently buried, the property owner shall promptly lower or raise his
service pipe to conform to the new ground elevation. In case the property
owner fails or neglects to make such alterations promptly, the supply of
water will be shut off until the alterations are completed, and a new charge,
as set forth in the schedule of rates established pursuant to § 219-29, will be
made to cover the labor and expense by the City resulting from the property
owner's failure so to do.
§ 219-14. Safety valves; liability for damages. [Amended 12-5-2016
by L.L. No. 17-2016]
In all places where steam boilers, hot-water tanks, refrigerating or airconditioning
units are supplied with water from the water system, the
property owner or consumer must see that the plumber places a suitable
safety valve, vacuum valve or other proper device to prevent damage from
collapse or explosion when water is shut off. The City shall not be liable for
any damage resulting from sudden shutting off of the supply of water from
any steam boiler or other fixture deriving its supply from the water supply.
(2) Notwithstanding the penalties hereinabove provided, the City of
Beacon may maintain an action or proceeding in a court of
competent jurisdiction to compel compliance with or to restrain by
injunction the violation of any provision of this chapter.

property according to the rate schedule. The City reserves the right to
require that a separate meter be installed for each residential unit,
including separate dwelling units in mobile home parks and multiple
dwellings.
B. There will be an initial meter charge equal to the cost of the meter to
the City. All meters shall remain the property of the City of Beacon.
C. Any property owner or owners who has/have not allowed the
installation of radio-read water meters as of the date of passage of this
subsection shall be surcharged a penalty of 25% on each and every
water bill until such time as the radio-read water meter has actually
been installed. This penalty can be appealed for a due process hearing
pursuant to Chapter 34.
D. The property owner or consumer shall be responsible for the
maintenance, repair and replacement of all water meters. The property
owner or consumer shall notify the City within five business days of
discovering any defect with or removal of the water meter that the
owner knows of or should have known of. Failure to notify the City of an
issue with the meter that the property owner or consumer is aware of or
should have been aware of within five business days shall constitute a
violation, punishable pursuant to § 219-40 of this chapter. The City
reserves the right to inspect water meters.
E. In any instance where a meter has been removed without authorization
from the City, and such removal prevents the City from calculating
water usage, the next water bill shall be charged at twice the amount of
the highest water bill issued within the last two years.
F. Any unauthorized bypass of a water meter or unauthorized modification
to the service pipe, meter, or meter appurtenances that results in the
water meter's failure to register water usage shall constitute a
violation, punishable pursuant § 219-40.
A. In the event that the pipes of the property owner are not in proper
condition for the installation, repair, or replacement of a meter, the
property owner shall cause said pipes at the point at which said meter is

210:781
§ 219-17. Meters in building having unrelated occupancy.
Each building or parts thereof having unrelated occupancy or separate or
distinct use shall, at the option of the owner, have a separate meter, but said
meter shall be secured from the City and paid for by the owner, together
with the cost of installation thereof. Said meter shall be installed under the
direction and to the satisfaction of the City.
§ 219-18. Failure of meter to register. [Amended 12-5-2016 by L.L.
No. 17-2016]

No seal placed by the Water Department for the protection of any meter,
valve or other water connection shall be tampered with or defaced.
Tampering with or breaking the seal of any meter, valve or other connection
shall be a violation of this chapter subject to the penalties set forth in
§ 219-40. If the seal is broken, the Water Department reserves the right to
remove and test the meter at the customer's expense.
B. If, due to acts, omissions or negligence on the part of the owner, the
meter becomes inoperable, the owner will be charged for the cost of the
meter, unless it is determined that the meter is defective.
A. If a meter is out of order and fails to register, the property owner or
consumer will be charged at the average consumption as shown by the
meter when in order. If, after 45 days of written notice from the City, the
water meter remains out of order due to the property owner or
consumer failing to provide access or cooperating with the City in
performing the repair and the water meter continues to fail to register,
the property owner or consumer will be surcharged a penalty of 25% on
each and every water bill until the meter is repaired and the property
owner grants the City access to inspect the water meter or the City
obtains a valid search warrant to be issued by a judge pursuant to
§ 219-35.
B. If a property owner or consumer challenges the accuracy of the water
meter, the property owner or consumer shall remove the water meter,
have a temporary water meter installed at their expense and provide
said water meter to the City. The City shall test the water meter to
certify the accuracy of the water meter. If the water meter is found to be
defective, the City shall pay the costs associated with certification. If
the water meter is not defective, the property owner or consumer shall
pay the costs associated with certification and replacement of the water
meter.

In the event that the current quarterly bill on a City of Beacon water
account is four or more times higher than its highest quarterly bill over the
most recent four quarterly bills, and the City Administrator determines the
abnormally large bill is a result of either estimated billing or a defective
external reading device which results in the actual interior meter
registering higher than the external reading device, not as a result of any
tampering, the City Administrator may allow payment of such abnormally
high bill in eight equal installments over that and the next seven

§ 220-1. Title.
This chapter will be known as the "City of Beacon Waterfront Consistency
Review Law."
§ 220-2. Authority and purpose.
§ 220-3. Applicability.
All boards, departments, offices, other bodies or officers of the City of
Beacon are responsible for the implementation of the LWRP within the
bounds of their jurisdiction and must comply with this chapter, to the extent
A. This chapter is adopted under the authority of the Municipal Home Rule
Law and the Waterfront Revitalization of Coastal Areas and Inland
Waterways Act (Article 42 of the Executive Law).
B. This chapter is intended to provide a framework for agencies of the City
of Beacon to consider the policies and purposes contained in the Local
Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP) when reviewing applications
for actions and also when considering undertaking direct agency
actions; and to assure to the maximum extent practicable that such
actions are consistent with the said policies and purposes.
C. It is the intention of the City of Beacon that the preservation,
enhancement and utilization of the natural and man-made resources of
the City's unique coastal area take place in a coordinated and
comprehensive manner to ensure a proper balance between natural
resources and the need to accommodate population growth and
economic development. Accordingly, it is the purpose of this chapter to
achieve such a balance, permitting the beneficial use of coastal
resources while preventing loss of living marine resources and wildlife;
diminution of open space areas or public access to the waterfront;
shoreline erosion; impairment of scenic beauty; losses due to flooding,
erosion and sedimentation; or permanent adverse changes to ecological
systems.
D. The substantive provisions of this chapter shall only apply while there is
in existence a Local Waterfront Revitalization Program which has been
adopted in accordance with Article 42 of the Executive Law of the State
of New York.

boundary lines, regulations for the less restricted portion or portions of
such lot shall not extend into the more restricted portion or portions.
A. District boundary lines are intended to follow streets, rights-of-way,
watercourses or lot lines, or be parallel or perpendicular thereto, unless
such district boundary lines are fixed by dimensions, as shown on the
Zoning Map. If no distance is given, such dimension shall be
determined by use of the scale shown on the Zoning Map.
B. Where district boundaries are indicated as following approximately
streets, rights-of-way or watercourses, the center lines thereof shall be
construed to be such boundaries.

follow the edge of lakes, ponds, reservoirs or other bodies of water, the
mean high-water lines thereof shall be construed to be the district
boundaries, except that the regulations of the most restrictive district
on the edge of such a body of water shall apply to the area within the
mean high-water line and the body of water thereof.
F. Any boundary extending into the Hudson River or Fishkill Creek shall
be deemed to extend to the boundary of the City, unless otherwise
indicated.

§ 223-7. Conformity required. [Amended 11-4-2019 by L.L. No.
9-2019]
No building shall be erected, moved, altered, rebuilt or enlarged, nor shall
any land or building be used, designed or arranged to be used, for any
purpose or any manner, except in conformity with all regulations,
requirements and restrictions specified in this chapter for the district in
which such building or land is located. The details of any plan or site
plan approved by the City Council, Planning Board or Board of Appeals
acting under the terms of this chapter and any conditions attached to such
approval as set forth on the plan or resolution shall be deemed to be such
requirements.
§ 223-8. Requirements declared to be minimum.
In interpreting and complying with this chapter, the requirements contained
herein are declared to be the minimum requirements necessary for the
attainment of the purposes set forth in Article I.
§ 223-9. Most restrictive provisions to govern.
Where this chapter requires a greater width or size of yards or other open
spaces or a lower height of building or a fewer number of stories or a
greater percentage of lot area to be left unoccupied, or otherwise imposes
greater restrictions than required by any other statute, bylaw, ordinance or
regulation, the provisions of this chapter shall govern. Where the provisions
of any other statute, bylaw, ordinance or regulation require a greater width
or size of yards or other open spaces or a lower height of building or a fewer
number of stories or a greater percentage of lot area to be left unoccupied,
or otherwise impose greater restrictions than are required by this chapter,
the provisions of such statute, bylaw, ordinance or regulation shall govern.
§ 223-10. Nonconforming uses and structures.
A. Continuing existing nonconforming uses. Except as provided in
§ 223-10H herein, any lawful use of a structure or of land existing on
the effective date of this chapter may be continued even though such
use does not conform to the use provisions of this chapter. Such uses
shall be deemed nonconforming uses. [Amended 12-29-1997 by L.L.
No. 14-1997]
B. Nonconforming use of land. Where no structure is involved, the lawful
nonconforming use of land may be continued, provided that:
(1) Such nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or increased, nor
shall it be extended to occupy a greater area of land than occupied
by such use at the time of the adoption of this chapter.
§ 223-7 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-10
220:811
(2) Such nonconforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to
any other portion of the lot or parcel of land occupied by such
nonconforming use at the time of the adoption of this chapter.
(3) If such nonconforming use of land, or any portion thereof, ceases
for any reason whatsoever for a continuous period of more than six
months, or is changed to a conforming use, any future use of such
land shall be in conformity with all provisions of this chapter.
(4) No nonconforming use of land shall be changed to another
nonconforming use.
C. Nonconforming use of structures. The nonconforming use of a building
or structure may be continued, provided that:
(1) Such building or structure shall not be enlarged or extended unless
the use therein is changed to a conforming use. (See Subsection E.)
(2) Such nonconforming building shall not be structurally altered
during its life to an extent greater than 25% of its fair market value,
as determined by the City Tax Assessor, unless such alterations are
required by law or by the provisions of Subsection H herein;
provided, however, that such maintenance and repair work as is
required to keep a nonconforming building or structure in sound
condition shall be permitted and provided further that any such
nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of the
building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use
at the time of the adoption of this chapter.
(3) A nonconforming use of a building may be changed only to a use of
less nonconformity, as determined by the Board of Appeals.
(4) If any nonconforming use of a building ceases for any reason for a
continuous period of more than one year or is changed to a
conforming use or if the building in or on which such use is
conducted or maintained is moved for any distance whatever for
any reason, then any future use of such building shall be in
conformity with the standards specified by this chapter for the
district in which such building is located.
(5) If any building in which any nonconforming use is conducted or
maintained is hereafter removed, the subsequent use of any land
on which such building was located, and the subsequent use of any
building thereon, shall be in conformity with the standards
specified by this chapter for the district in which such land or
building is located.
D. Restoration of damaged buildings. If any nonconforming building shall
be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than 50%, no repairs or
reconstruction shall be made unless every portion of such building is
made to conform to all the regulations of this chapter for the district in
which it is located. Where the destruction of such nonconforming
§ 223-10 BEACON CODE § 223-10
220:812
building is less than 50%, it may be restored and the nonconforming
use continued, provided that the total cost of such restoration does not
exceed the replacement value of the destroyed portion of the building
at the time of its destruction and further provided that such restoration
is started within a period of six months of such destruction and is
diligently prosecuted to completion. Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any wall
declared unsafe by the Building Inspector.
E. Nonconformity other than use. A building that is conforming in use but
does not conform to the height, yard, lot area, lot dimension, land
coverage, off-street parking, loading, minimum house size or similar
dimensional requirements of this chapter shall not be considered to be
nonconforming within the meaning of Subsections C, F and H. No
permit shall be issued that will result in the increase of any such
nonconformities, except that each side yard of the aforementioned lots
may be reduced by one inch for every foot that such lot is less than the
minimum width required by this chapter.
F. Registration of nonconforming uses. During the first three complete
calendar months following the effective date of this chapter or of any
amendment thereto, the owner or owners of property on which there is
a nonconforming use of land or buildings (within the definition of this
chapter or which may be made so by an amendment thereto) shall
register such nonconforming use by filing, with the Board of Appeals, a
statement of such nonconforming use. The acceptance of such
statements shall not constitute an authorization to operate an unlawful
use. The filing of a false registration statement shall constitute a
violation of this chapter. If the owner of a nonconforming use shall not
so register it, such use shall be presumed to have been discontinued
unless the owner submits proof that the use existed legally prior to the
effective date of the regulation that made it nonconforming. Annually,
the Board of Appeals may send a questionnaire to the persons who have
registered a nonconforming use, inquiring as to the status of such use.
Such questionnaire shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the last addresses available from the filed registration
statements. If such questionnaire is not returned within 90 days, the
Board of Appeals shall so record this fact and send a notice to the last
address of the owner, to the effect that the nonconforming use is
presumed to have been abandoned or discontinued unless the owner
establishes, to the satisfaction of the Board of Appeals, proof that the
use has continued.
G. Nonconforming signs. Regardless of any other provisions of this
chapter, every sign which, after the adoption of this chapter, may exist
as a nonconforming use in any district shall be discontinued and
removed or changed to conform to the standards of said district within
a period of 120 days from the date of the adoption of this chapter.
H. Residential uses on Main Street. [Added 12-29-1997 by L.L. No.
14-1997]
§ 223-10 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-10
220:813
(1) Legislative intent. The Central Business (CB) and General Business
(GB) Districts along Main Street have traditionally been and will
continue in the future to essentially be retail/service in nature. In
order for the Main Street business district to be healthy and vital, it
must compete successfully with other business districts. One of the
essential characteristics of a healthy downtown business district is
a high degree of continuity between adjacent retail and service
uses, so that consumers can conveniently walk from one storefront
to the next without frequently being interrupted by gaps between
the retail and service uses. These gaps are the result of uses which
are not open to the general public such as, in this case, residential
uses. Residences which are located at the front of the ground floor
of the buildings on Main Street are believed to be more injurious to
the health and vitality of this business district than residences
located at the rear of the ground floor of said buildings because the
shopping portion of the business district is primarily, but not
exclusively, at the front of said buildings. It is recognized, however,
that there are currently several vacant storefronts on Main Street.
The City Council has determined that the residential units affected
by this subsection should not be converted to retail space unless
the vacancy rate for such retail space has declined to an acceptable
level in the discretion of the City Council. As a result, the special
permit procedure outlined herein will specifically take into
consideration the vacancy rate on Main Street at the time this
subsection is implemented.
(2) Discontinuance. The following provisions pertain to buildings
located on Main Street in the Central Business and General
Business Zoning Districts: residential uses which are neither
located on the upper floors nor in the rear of the first floor of said
buildings shall be discontinued effective October 1, 2002. The City
of Beacon shall notify all affected property owners no later than
October 1, 2001, that all residential units so situated in the Central
Business (CB) and General Business (GB) Zoning Districts must be
converted no later than October 1, 2002, pursuant to the terms of
this subsection.
(3) Special use permit. Any property owner affected by this section
shall be eligible to apply to the City Council for a special use permit
to continue said residential occupancy for a period of two years.
There shall be no further permits issued after the aforementioned
permit has expired. Such application must be made no later than
April 1, 2002, in order to maintain eligibility for the special use
permit. The general provisions regarding the issuance of special
use permits set forth in this chapter shall also apply to this
application. In addition, the City Council shall take the vacancy rate
for storefronts on Main Street into consideration when determining
whether to issue such a permit. [Amended 10-7-2002 by L.L. No.
27-2002]
§ 223-10 BEACON CODE § 223-10
220:814
§ 223-11. Supplementary regulations.
The provisions of this chapter shall be subject to such exceptions, additions
or modifications as are herein provided by the following general
supplementary regulations in §§ 223-12 through 223-16.
§ 223-12. Buildings, uses and lots.
I. Variance procedure. Any person or persons jointly or severally
aggrieved by the terms of this chapter shall have the right to review a
special permit determination by the City Council by a public hearing
before the Zoning Board of Appeals and by a proceeding under Article
78 of the Civil Practice Law and Rules, which proceedings must be
commenced within 30 days of the filing of such determination with the
City Clerk. [Added 12-29-1997 by L.L. No. 14-1997]
J. Exemption. This local law shall not apply to the residence located at 317
Main Street. This use as a single-family dwelling shall be continued as a
nonconforming use notwithstanding the remaining provisions of this
local law. However, the existing commercial portion of these premises
which front on Main Street, may not be converted to a residential use.
[Added 12-29-1997 by L.L. No. 14-1997]
K. (Reserved)135
L. General nuisances. Upon a complaint registered by the Building
Inspector or 50% of the property owners within 250 feet of a
nonconforming use which is considered to be a general nuisance or
hazard to the health, safety, welfare and morals of uses or structures
within 250 feet of such nonconforming use or uses, the Zoning Board of
Appeals shall hold a public hearing and make a finding with respect to
the nuisance or hazardous condition which exists and shall determine
the necessity of terminating such nonconforming use. Such uses shall
be terminated within such reasonable time as shall be determined by
the Zoning Board of Appeals as related to the reasonable amortization
of the capital investment in such uses. [Added 7-7-2003 by L.L. No.
7-2003]
A. Lot for every building. Every building hereafter erected shall be located
on a lot as herein defined, and, except as herein provided, there shall be
not more than one main building and its accessory buildings on one lot,
except for multifamily or nonresidential buildings in districts where
such uses are permitted.
B. Yard and open space for every building. No yard or other open space
provided about any building for the purpose of complying with the
provisions of these regulations shall be included as any part of the yard
or open space for any other building: no yard or any other open space
135. Editor's Note: Former Subsection K, Discontinuance of existing tattoo and body-piercing
parlors, added 12-4-2000 by L.L. No. 18-2000, was repealed 6-18-2012 by L.L. No. 12-2012.
§ 223-10 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-12
220:815
on one lot shall be considered as a yard or open space for a building on
any other lot.
C. Subdivision of a lot. Where a lot is formed hereafter from the part of a
lot already occupied by a building, such separation shall be affected in
such a manner as not to impair conformity with any of the requirements
of this chapter with respect to the existing building and all yards and
other required spaces in connection therewith, and no permit shall be
issued for the erection of a building on the new lot thus created unless it
complies with all the provisions of this chapter.
D. Irregularly shaped lots. Where a question exists as to the proper
application of any of the requirements of this chapter to a particular lot
or parcel because of the peculiar or irregular shape of the lot or parcel,
the Board of Appeals shall determine how the requirements of the
chapter shall be applied.
E. Oversize lots. A lot which does not conform to one or more of the
minimum dimensional requirements of this chapter for the district in
which it is located, but contains within its boundaries the potential
outlines for a lot which would conform to all of the applicable
requirements of this chapter, shall be deemed to be a conforming lot
within the meaning of this chapter.
F. Lots under water or within the one-hundred-year floodplain ("area of
special flood hazard"). No more than 10% of the minimum area
requirement of a lot may be fulfilled by land which is under water or
within the one-hundred-year floodplain ("area of special flood hazard").
All minimum front, side and rear yard requirements must be satisfied by
measurement on dry land. [Amended 10-21-1991 by L.L. No.
12-1991]
G. Required street frontage. No building permit shall be issued for any
structure unless the lot upon which that structure is to be built has the
required frontage on a street, private road or highway, as defined
herein, which frontage, except in the case of a common driveway,
provides the actual access to such structure, and which street, private
road or highway shall have been suitably improved to the satisfaction of
the Planning Board or a performance bond posted therefor as provided
in § 36 of the General City Law (Chapter 21 of the Consolidated Laws) of
New York State. [Amended 6-20-2005 by L.L. No. 4-2005]
H. Lot width required, Within any residence district, no part of any
dwelling or other structure housing a main use and, within any business
district, no part of any residence structure shall be erected on that part
of a lot where the lot width is less than the minimum requirements for
the district in which it is located.
I. New buildings on lots less than the minimum area. A permit may be
issued for the erection of a building on a lot for which a valid
conveyance has been recorded or contract of sale has been signed and
§ 223-12 BEACON CODE § 223-12
220:816
the conveyance recorded prior to the adoption of this chapter,
notwithstanding that the area or dimensions of such lot is less than that
required for the district in which such lot lies, provided that all yard
setbacks and other requirements which are in effect at the time of the
obtaining of the building permit are complied with and provided that
the owner of such lot does not own other lots contiguous thereto. If this
is the case, such other lots or so much thereof as might be necessary
shall be combined with the first named lot to make a single conforming
lot, or a lot that conforms to the fullest extent possible, whereupon a
permit may be issued, but only for such combined lots.
J. Modification of lot requirements. For the purposes set forth earlier in
this chapter, and to promote the most appropriate use of land, to
preserve the natural and scenic qualities of open lands, to promote
natural resource preservation and conservation, and to facilitate the
adequate and economical construction of community facilities and
utilities, all directed towards the objective of fostering and obtaining
land development of good quality and design at reasonable economic
cost, the Planning Board is hereby authorized to review and act upon all
subdivisions in accordance with the following provisions. In all cases,
the Planning Board shall have the full power of subdivision approval,
approval with conditions or denial, as authorized by the General City
Law. These provisions may be utilized: [Amended 3-1-2004 by L.L.
No. 3-2004; 4-5-2004 by L.L. No. 6-2004]
(1) When applied for by the applicant of the land to be subdivided if, in
the judgment and discretion of the Planning Board, their
application would benefit the City by satisfying one or more of the
purposes set forth in Subsection J above; or
(2) Where the Planning Board determines that their application would
benefit the City by satisfying one or more of the purposes set forth
in Subsection J above and where the Planning Board determines
that one or more of the criteria as set forth in subsections (a)
through (d) below would be achieved. In this case the Planning
Board shall seek authorization from the City Council, on a case-bycase
basis, to require the applicant to submit an application which
reflects such modifications of applicable provisions of this chapter.
(a) The preservation of a unique or significant natural feature of
the site, including but not limited to a vegetative feature,
wildlife habitat, surface water supply, underground aquifer,
endangered species, rock formation, steep slope area, etc.
(b) The protection of a unique or significant feature of the manmade
environment of the site, including but not limited to a
building, structure or artifact of architectural, historical or
archaeological value.
§ 223-12 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-12
220:817
(c) The preservation of any unique or significant aesthetic feature
of the site, including but not limited to a community vista,
ridgeline, historic setting, etc.
(d) The protection of any other unique or significant feature of the
site which the Planning Board determines to be important for
historic, recreational, educational, open space or similar
purposes.
(3) Provisions.
(a) Average density subdivisions. Simultaneously with the
approval of a subdivision plat and pursuant to § 37 of the
General City Law, the Planning Board may modify the zoning
regulations with respect to lot area and dimensions, provided
that the average size of all lots shown on the subdivision plat
shall be equal to or greater than the permitted minimum lot
area in such district and that there shall not be a greater
average density of population or cover of the land with
buildings than is permitted in such district and further
provided that no lot shall have less than the minimum lot area
and dimensions required for lots in the next less restrictive
residential zoning district to the one in which the property is
located. For the purpose of this section, "average density" shall
be determined by the number of single-family residences
which could be built under the zoning district standards in full
conformity with the City's Subdivision Regulations136 and all
other applicable requirements. The basis for this
determination by the Planning Board shall be a conventional
subdivision sketch layout for the subject property.
(b) Conservation subdivisions. Simultaneously with the approval
of a subdivision plat and pursuant to § 37 of the General City
Law, the Planning Board may modify the zoning regulations in
R1 and RD Residence Districts with respect to layout,
configuration and design of lots, including minimum lot area,
width, depth and frontage, minimum front, side and rear yards,
and other similar requirements, buildings and structures,
roads, utility lines and other infrastructure, parks or
landscaping, provided that:
[1] The permitted number of dwelling units in no case exceeds
the number which could be permitted, in the Planning
Board's judgment, if the land were subdivided into lots
conforming to all the normally applicable requirements of
this chapter, the Land Subdivision Regulations,137 the
Dutchess County Department of Health regulations and all
other applicable standards. The basis for this
136. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision of Land.
137. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision of Land.
§ 223-12 BEACON CODE § 223-12
220:818
determination by the Planning Board shall be the
conventional subdivision sketch layout information as may
be required by said Board.
[2] The maximum permitted building height requirements
shall be the same as those normally applicable to other
dwellings in the zoning district in which the property is
located.
[3] In both the R1 and RD Residence Districts, the dwelling
units permitted may, at the discretion of the Planning
Board, be in detached, semidetached, attached or
multistory structures.
[4] In the event that some part of said subdivision plat
includes land to be devoted to park, recreation or open
space, the Planning Board, as a condition of plat approval,
may establish such conditions as shall be approved by the
City Council.
[5] In addition to compliance with any special standards,
requirements and procedures as set forth in this
Subsection J(3)(b), conservation developments shall also
be subject to review and public hearing by the Planning
Board in accordance with the same procedures as would
otherwise be applicable to conventional subdivision plats.
Upon the filing of the plat in the office of the County Clerk,
a copy shall also be required to be filed with the City Clerk,
who shall make the appropriate notations and references
thereto on the official copy of the City Zoning Map.
K. Business entrances on residential streets extending into districts.
Where any street extends through a residential district and into a
business district, any block with frontage on said street, which frontage
is partly in the residential district and partly in the business district,
shall not be used for any business purpose except as herein set forth.
Any business structure erected in said business district shall face and
open upon a street which, for its entire extent adjacent to said block, is
within the business district, except that show windows in such business
structure may be built and exposed upon another street within the area
set aside as a part of such business district. All other entrances to the
business structures must face on the street which for its entire extent
adjacent to the block is within the business district, except that
entrances may be made from the other street to the upper stories of
such business structures, a single entrance may be made at the corner
of such other street and any second means of egress required by law
and access to the structure from off-street parking facilities shall be
permitted.
L. Transition between residential and nonresidential districts. Where a lot
in a commercial or industrial district abuts a lot in a residential district,
§ 223-12 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-12
220:819
§ 223-13. Yards; building projections.
there shall be provided along such abutting lines a yard equal in width
or depth to that required in the residential district.
M. Premature subdivision. No building permit shall be issued for any
construction, other than that required for the maintenance of minimum
health and safety standards, within the area of a subdivision designated
by the City Council as being premature, as defined herein, until such
time as a revised plat has been filed in the office of the Dutchess County
Clerk, nor shall any such building permit be issued within a period of 60
days from the date a report on a premature subdivision has been sent to
the City Council by the City Planning Board.
N. Front of new dwellings. The front of any new one-family dwelling shall
face the front lot line. In the case of a lot fronting on more than one
street, the new dwelling shall face the street frontage which will make
it most consistent with the front of other dwellings in the block in which
it is located. For purposes of this section, the front of the dwelling shall
be as determined by the Building Inspector based upon such factors as
the location of the front door, the interior floor plan and the exterior
appearance of the building. [Added 6-20-1988]
A. Terraces. A paved terrace shall not be considered in the determination
of lot coverage or yard requirements; provided, however, that such
terrace is without roof, awnings, screens, walls, parapets or other forms
of enclosure. Such terrace, however, may have a guard railing, open
wall or fence, but such terrace shall not project into any yard to a point
closer than five feet from any lot line.
B. Porches. No porch may project into any required yard. Any two-story or
any enclosed porch, or one having a roof and capable of being enclosed,
shall be considered a part of the building in determining the yard
requirements or amount of lot coverage.
C. Projecting horizontal architectural features. Architectural features,
such as windowsills, belt courses, chimneys, cornices, eaves or bay
windows, shall not project more than three feet into any required yard.
The sum of any bay window projections on any wall shall not exceed 1/4
of the length of any said wall.
D. Fire escapes. Open fire escapes may extend into any required yard not
more than six feet: provided, however, that such fire escapes shall not
be closer than four feet at any point to any lot line.
E. Projecting features above the roof level. The height limitations of this
chapter shall not apply to flagpoles, church spires, belfries, cupolas and
domes not used for human occupancy, nor to chimneys, ventilators,
skylights, water tanks, bulkheads or similar features, radio and
television antennas for the use of residents of dwellings and
apartments, necessary mechanical appurtenances usually carried
§ 223-12 BEACON CODE § 223-13
220:820
above the roof level, wireless telecommunication services facilities and
radio towers. Such a feature, however, shall be erected only to a height
necessary to accomplish the purpose it is intended to serve. The total
area covered by such features shall not exceed, in cross-sectional area,
15% of the area of the roof on which they are located. Such features
as water tanks, cooling towers and bulkheads shall be enclosed within
walls. The material and design of such walls shall be in harmony with
the main walls of the building on which they are located. [Amended
7-15-2002 by L.L. No. 21-2002; 12-2-2002 by L.L. No. 30-2002]
F. Parapet walls. The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to prevent
the erection, above the building height limit, of a parapet wall
extending above such height limit less than five feet.
G. Walls and fences. [Amended 7-2-2012 by L.L. No. 14-2012]
(1) The yard requirements of this chapter shall not be deemed to
prohibit any necessary retaining wall nor to prohibit any fence or
wall, provided that the height of such fence or wall does not exceed
four feet in front yards, six feet in side yards and six feet in rear
yards, except that mesh garden or deer fencing shall not exceed
eight feet in height. Notwithstanding the four-foot height limitation
for fences and walls in front yards, the Planning Board shall have
the discretion to approve a fence or wall up to six feet in height in
front yards in connection with site plan approval where necessary
for screening purposes.
(2) The height of a fence shall be the vertical distance from natural or
finished grade, as applicable, to the highest part of the fence
section, except that the height of a fence on a retaining wall shall
be measured from the top of the retaining wall to the highest part
of the fence. Where the grade is uneven from the front of the fence
to the back of the fence, the fence shall be measured from the side
with the lowest natural or finished grade, as applicable. Where the
grade along the line of the fence is uneven, the height of the fence
may be measured from the base of the fence in eight-foot to tenfoot
sections whereby one part of the base of each section shall be
at grade and no point of the base of the fence shall be more than
one foot above natural grade. For all fences and walls installed
after the effective date of this amendment and for all existing
fences and walls of which 50% or more is repaired or replaced after
the effective date of this amendment, the finished side of the fence
or wall shall face neighboring properties or the street, and such
fence or wall shall comply with all requirements of § 223-13G.
(3) No fences and walls shall be permitted in locations where they will
interfere with adequate sight distance for vehicles exiting from a
road or driveway on the parcel where the wall or fence is to be
constructed or from driveways on neighboring property.
(4) No signs shall be permitted on fences.
§ 223-13 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-13
220:821
(5) Prohibited materials. The following fences and fencing materials
are specifically prohibited in any location on a lot: barbed-wire
fences; sharp-pointed fences; unsafe materials; electrically charged
aboveground fences; chicken wire; and temporary fences, such as,
but not limited to, snow fences, expandable fences and collapsible
fences; and in no event shall canvas, cloth or other similar opaque

H. Underground structures. Structures which are built completely below
the level of the natural existing ground surface may be located in any
side or rear yard, provided that they are not situated within three feet
of any property line, or in the front yard, provided that they are set back
from the front property line not less than 1/2 the distance required for
aboveground structures. In no case, however, shall underground
structures be required to set back further than the distance that would
be required for aboveground structures.
I. Visibility at intersections. On a corner lot in any residence district, no
fence wall, hedge or other structure or planting more than three feet in
height shall be erected, placed or maintained within the triangular area
formed by the intersecting street center lines and a straight line joining
said street center lines at points which are 100 feet distant from the
point of intersection, measured along said street center lines. The
height of three feet shall be measured above the road surface at the
center line of the road having the lesser elevation. This subsection shall
not apply to existing trees, provided that no branches are closer than
six feet to the ground.
J. Corner lots. On a corner lot in any residence district, there shall be
provided a side yard on the side street equal in depth to the required
front yard on said lot, or, if the lot is to be occupied by a one-family
home, such side yard may be reduced to 25% of actual lot width.
K. Exception for existing alignment of buildings. If on one side of a street
within 250 feet of any lot there is pronounced uniformity of alignment of
the fronts of existing buildings and of the depths of front yards greater
or less than the depth specified in the Schedules of Regulations,138 a
front yard shall be required in connection with any new building which
shall conform as nearly as practicable to those existing on the adjacent
lots, except that no such building shall be required to set back from the
street a distance greater than 40 feet.

shall be erected or maintained on any building, unless such awning or
feature shall be firmly attached to the building and is at all points at
least eight feet above the sidewalk area.
M. Swimming pools. All swimming pools shall be considered structures
and shall set back from lot lines at least the minimum distance required
for other principal buildings and structures in that district.
(1) If a swimming pool, as located, is within 100 feet from a dwelling
other than the owner's or within 50 feet from any street or property
line, the same must be completely surrounded by a fence or wall
enclosure not less than four feet in height with openings, holes or
gaps (exclusive of gates or doors) therein not more than four inches
in one dimension, a part of which enclosure may consist of a
dwelling house or accessory building. A wall or fence or other
enclosure wholly enclosing a dwelling house shall constitute
compliance with this requirement.
(2) Each and every gate or door opening through such enclosure shall
be equipped and maintained with effective self-closing and selflatching
devices, except that the floor of any occupied dwelling
house forming a part of such enclosure need not be so equipped.
The use of a natural barrier, hedge or pool cover will be deemed to
satisfy the requirement of a fence or wall as specified above when
approved by the Building Inspector.
A. Landscaping, screening and buffer areas.
(1) All portions of multifamily and nonresidential properties which are
not used for locations for buildings, structures, off-street parking
and loading areas, sidewalks or similar purposes shall be
landscaped and permanently maintained in such manner as to
minimize erosion and stormwater runoff and harmoniously blend
such uses with the residential character of the City as a whole.
(2) Buffer areas. Wherever a buffer strip is required by this chapter, it
shall meet the following standards:
(a) Be at least 10 feet in width along any lot line abutting or
directly across the street from a lot in a residence district.
(b) Be of evergreen planting of such type, height and spacing as, in
the judgment of the Planning Board, will screen the activities
on the lot from view of a person standing at a street level on
the adjoining residential lot. The plan and specifications for
such planting shall be filed with the approved plan for the use
of the lot.
(c) A wall or fence, of location, height and design approved by the
Planning Board, may be substituted for the required planting.

(d) Where the existing topography and/or landscaping provides
adequate screening, the Planning Board may modify the
planting and/or buffer area requirements.
B. Exterior lighting. All exterior lighting accessory to a residential,
industrial, multifamily or nonresidential use, including the lighting of
signs, shall be subject to the following standards: [Amended
12-9-2019 by L.L. No. 11-2019]
(1) The type, location, and shading of such lighting shall prevent the
spillover of light onto any adjacent residential or multifamily
property or direct glare onto any public sidewalk or street.
(2) Such lighting shall use full cutoff fixtures that do not emit light
above the horizontal plane into the night sky, except for lighting for
short-term events or holidays, flagpole lighting, decorative light
sources under 600 lumens, public parks and other public specialty
lighting, as determined by the Building Inspector.
(3) Hours of lighting and fixture height, type, design, intensity, and
color temperature may be determined by the Planning Board in
acting on any site development plan upon consideration of the
following considerations:
(a) Lighting fixtures in pedestrian areas should be a maximum of
15 feet in height and parking lot lighting fixtures should be a
maximum of 20 feet.
(b) Pedestrian and parking lot areas should average approximately
one footcandle. Only high security areas may require lighting
in the two to five footcandle range, while over five footcandles
is usually a waste of energy and a source of glare.
(c) Color temperatures should be in the range of 2,400 to 4,000
Kelvin degrees.
(d) The color rendering index should be in the range of 80 to 100.
(e) Adaptive controls, such as dimmers, timers, and motion sensor
shut-off lighting, should be used whenever appropriate.
C. Refuse disposal. Adequate facilities for disposal of refuse shall be
provided in all districts. In multifamily and nonresidential districts, all
refuse disposal units or locations for deposit must be screened from
view and designed in such fashion as to be fireproof and to prevent
access by rodents and blowing away of refuse.
D. Courts. In any district, wherever a room occupied for residential
purposes cannot be reasonably and adequately lighted and ventilated
from a street or from a yard, as required by this chapter, a court
conforming to the provisions of this section shall be provided on which
such rooms shall open. The least dimension of any inner court at the sill
level of the lowest windows shall be equal to the height of the highest

applicable provisions of this chapter. All accessory buildings shall
comply with the dimensional and bulk requirements set forth on
the accompanying Schedules of Regulations constituting § 223-17C
and E of this chapter unless specifically provided otherwise herein.
For the purpose of this section, "residential lots" shall mean any lot
containing a permitted residential use.
(2) Sheds. A shed may be erected, provided that it is used for storage
and utility purposes that are customary and incidental to the
existing residence. Notwithstanding any requirement in the
Schedule of Regulations for Residential Districts139 to the contrary,
the shed shall be no larger than 144 square feet in floor area and a
maximum of 10 feet in height at its highest point.

avoid the development of hilltops, ridgelines and very steep slopes, and
toward this end, wherever practicable, new construction shall avoid
such areas, and existing vegetation in such areas shall not be disturbed
wherever practicable. The City Council, the Planning Board, the Zoning
Board of Appeals and the Building Inspector shall take these objectives
into consideration in reviewing and acting on any plans submitted
pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. Further, no building,
development, construction of other site improvements, excavation,
filling, grading, or removal of significant vegetation shall be permitted
on a very steep slope unless the approval authority has determined:
[Amended 3-1-2004 by L.L. No. 2-2004]
(1) That there is no other suitable alternative area within the lot
available for the proposed use, improvement or development of
such lot;

G. The use shall be conducted in such a manner and during such hours
that it does not adversely affect the immediate neighborhood.
H. No external alterations, additions or changes to the structure(s) (other
than signage) shall be permitted which would adversely affect the

A. Intent. The City Council of the City of Beacon finds, declares and
determines that the exploration for natural gas, the extraction of
natural gas and the storage, transfer, treatment or disposal of natural
gas exploration and production wastes within the City of Beacon poses
a significant threat to its residents' health, safety and welfare. If natural
gas exploration or extraction or the storage, transfer, treatment or
disposal of natural gas exploration and production wastes were to occur
within the City, this activity would endanger the health, safety and
welfare of City residents through the deposit of toxins into the air, soil,
water, environment and the bodies of residents within the City. Clean
air and water are essential to most resources and activities in the
Beacon area and the quality of the air and the water will be degraded by
natural gas exploration and extraction activities and/or the storage,
transfer treatment or disposal of natural gas exploration and
§ 223-17.1 BEACON CODE § 223-17.2
220:834
production wastes; and natural gas exploration and extraction activities
and the storage, transfer, treatment or disposal of natural gas
exploration and production wastes may presently or in the future cause
irreparable harm to the City's water supply, pollution of the water, soil
and air, and may cause cancer, lung disease and respiratory diseases.
This ordinance is not directed at the regulatory scheme for the
operation of natural gas wells under the Oil, Gas and Solution Mining
Law of New York State. It only addresses land use and nuisance
concerns and the protection of the health, safety and welfare of the
people of the City of Beacon and the enhancement of its physical
environment.
B. Definitions. For the purposes of this section, certain words and terms
used herein are defined as follows:

NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION  Geologic or geophysical activities
related to the search for natural gas or other subsurface hydrocarbons
including prospecting, geophysical and geologic seismic surveying and

gas or other subsurface hydrocarbon deposits.
NATURAL GAS EXPLORATION AND PRODUCTION WASTES  Any
garbage, refuse, sludge, or other discarded materials, including solid,

A. Purposes and considerations.
(1) In the execution of this law it is recognized that there are some
uses which, due to their very nature, have serious objectionable
characteristics. The objectionable characteristics of these uses are
further heightened by their concentration in any one area, thereby
having deleterious effects on adjacent areas. Special regulation of
these uses is necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not
contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the surrounding
neighborhoods or land uses.
(2) It is further declared that the location of these uses in regard to
areas where our youth may regularly assemble and the general
atmosphere encompassing their operation is of great concern to
the City of Beacon.
(3) These special regulations are itemized to accomplish the primary
purposes of preventing a concentration of these uses in any one
area and restricting their accessibility to minors.
B. Definitions. The following definitions shall apply to the regulation of
adult uses:

within a detached single-family dwelling shall be 400 square feet. The
maximum floor area shall be 650 square feet, but in no case shall the
floor area of the apartment exceed 30% of the total floor area of the
dwelling building in which it is located. For an accessory apartment
located in an accessory building, the minimum floor area shall also be
300 square feet, and the maximum shall be 600 square feet, except that
the City Council may permit a smaller or larger accessory apartment
where appropriate in an existing accessory building constructed prior
to August 1, 1989. There shall be no more than one accessory
apartment permitted per single-family lot. However, in the case of a lot
which contains an existing accessory building or buildings that comply
with the minimum required setbacks required for a principal building in
the zoning district in which the lot is located and that were constructed
prior to August 1, 1989, one accessory apartment shall be permitted in
each such accessory building in addition to the one permitted in the
detached single-family dwelling; the area of such lot shall be at least
100% larger than the minimum lot area required in the district in which
the lot is located for each accessory apartment in excess of the first one.
E. Exterior appearance. If an accessory apartment is located in a detached
single-family dwelling, the entry to such unit and its design shall be
such that, to the degree reasonably feasible, the exterior appearance of

A. Development standards.
(1) An artist live/work space may exist on the first floor of a structure
only if the appearance and use of the live/work space on the street
side is consistent with the nature of the permitted uses in the
surrounding area. For example, if the surrounding area is retail in
nature at the first-floor level, the live/work space shall be restricted
to retail on the street side of the first floor, and said street side
space shall be large enough, in the opinion of the Building
Inspector, to support a typical retail enterprise.
(2) Each artist live/work space and its various components shall be
physically separate and distinct from other live/work spaces and
other uses within a particular building. The sharing of artist live/
work spaces by multiple tenancies, components thereof or utilities
shall not be permitted. However, access to live/work spaces may be
provided from common access areas, halls or corridors.
(3) Each artist live/work space must be individually equipped with an
enclosed bathroom containing a sink, toilet, shower or tub and
appropriate venting.
(4) Each artist live/work space must be individually equipped with a
kitchen consisting of a sink, nonportable stove, oven and
refrigerator.
(5) Each artist live/work space must contain a floor area of no less than
800 square feet, of which a minimum area shall be devoted to the
following: 35 square feet for an enclosed bathroom, 60 square feet
for a kitchen, and 120 square feet for a sleeping area.
152. Editor's Note: Section 2 of this local law also provided that it "shall apply to all accessory
apartments that are issued a permit from the enactment of § 223-24, 11-20-1989,
forward."
§ 223-24.1 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-24.3

commercial uses, artist live/work spaces shall not be used for
classroom instructional uses with more than two pupils at any one
time; the storage of flammable liquids or hazardous materials;
welding; or any open-flame work. Further, the work in the live/work
space shall be so conducted as not to cause noise, vibration, smoke,
odors, humidity, heat, cold, glare, dust, dirt or electrical
disturbance which is perceptible by the average person located
within any other residential or commercial unit within the structure
or beyond any lot line.
(9) Not more than one person who is 18 years of age or older may
reside within an artist live/work space per 300 square feet of
residential floor area. Further, not more than two persons who are
at least 18 years of age, of which at least one of whom is an artist in
residence, and not more than two children of said persons who are
under 22 years of age may reside within a live/work space on a
year-round basis.
(10) Only one nonresident employee may be employed within an artist
live/work space. This requirement may be waived for live/work
spaces that provide retail space on the first floor.
(11) Other than in a first-floor retail-oriented area, articles offered for
sale within a live/work space must include those produced by the
artist residing in said live/work space and may be offered with
other like items.
(12) One flush-mounted, nonilluminated sign, with a maximum area of
two square feet, attached adjacent to or near the street entrance
door to the live/work space may be used to identify the artist. This
sign may list only the name of the artist with a one- or two-word
description of the type of artwork or craft that is to be conducted
within the live/work space. Where two or more live/work spaces
occur within the same building, the signs must be placed in an
orderly fashion in relation to each other and must be part of a
coherent directory in which signs are ordered in a horizontal
fashion. Where five or more live/work spaces are developed within
one building, an interior directory sign shall be located in lieu of
individual signs on the building exterior.
(13) Residential space and work space shall not be rented separately or
used by persons other than those people legally residing within the
artist live/work spaces and permitted nonresident employees.
(14)No artist live/work space shall serve as a place from which
commercial vehicles are dispatched or operated.

persons working exclusively with paint, paper, clay and/or other
soft materials, and this use shall include photography, jewelry
making, graphic arts and other similar relatively quiet endeavors
as determined by the City Council in reviewing the proposed
special use permit application. Tattoo appliers, body piercers and
musicians shall not be considered artists for the purpose of this
use.
(17) Renewal inspections. Each artist live/work space shall be inspected
by the Building Department every two years in order to determine
whether the artist live/work space remains in compliance with this
section. Upon a satisfactory inspection report, the artist live/work
space owner shall be reissued a certificate of occupancy for two
additional years. If the Building Inspector determines that the
artist live/work space is not in compliance, the building owner or
manager shall have 60 days in which to rectify all noncomplying
elements and shall apply for reinspection with the Building
Department, subject to an additional fee. If all such noncomplying
elements are not rectified within the above-specified time frame,
the certificate of occupancy for the use shall expire and the use as
authorized by the special permit shall be terminated.154 [Added
9-19-2005 by L.L. No. 11-2005; amended 3-18-2013 by L.L.

not limited to architectural treatment, stealth design, use of neutral
or compatible coloring and materials, or alternative construction
and transmission technologies, shall be required to minimize the
visual impact of such facility from public thoroughfares, important
viewsheds designated by the City Council or listed in the City's
Comprehensive Plan, and surrounding properties to the extent
practicable, as determined by the City Council.
(3) No signs shall be erected on any wireless telecommunication
services facility except as may be required by the City Council for
security or safety purposes.
(4) All equipment enclosures and storage buildings associated with the
wireless telecommunication services facilities shall be consistent or
compatible with adjacent buildings in terms of design, materials
and colors and shall be appropriately landscaped.
(5) All special use permit applications for wireless telecommunication
services facilities shall contain a demonstration that the facility is
sited as to have the least adverse visual effect on the environment

appropriate color to blend with their background.
M. Lighting. The wireless telecommunication services facility shall not be
artificially lighted unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation
Administration or other federal, state or local authority.
N. Operational characteristics. Unless otherwise superseded by the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the design and use of the
proposed wireless telecommunication services facility, including its
cumulative impact with other existing and approved facilities, shall be
certified to conform to the maximum NIER exposure standards
promulgated by the FCC, as amended. Said certification shall include a
report by a licensed professional electrical engineer with expertise in
radio communication facilities and/or health physicist acceptable to the
City Council. A copy of such certification report shall be submitted to
the City Council prior to commencing operation of such facility and a
copy shall be filed with the Building Inspector. The City Council may
require annual certification of conformance with the applicable
emission standards. Additionally, copies of certification reports shall be
submitted to the City Council whenever they are required to be
submitted to the FCC. The City Council may hire a qualified
professional of its choosing to review and confirm such initial and
subsequent certification report(s), the cost of which shall be
reimbursed by the applicant in accordance with the escrow account
procedures established by the City for the reimbursement of
professional review fees for subdivision, site plan and special use
permit applications. Any violation of the emissions standards shall
require immediate discontinuation and correction of the use
responsible for the violation.
O. Noise. Noise-producing equipment shall be sited and/or insulated to

(2) Stormwater pollution prevention plan. A stormwater pollution
prevention plan consistent with the requirements of Chapter 190
shall be required for site plan approval. The SWPPP shall meet the
performance and design criteria and standards in Chapter 190,
Article II. The approved site plan shall be consistent with the
provisions of Chapter 190.
(3) Certificate of inspection. A certificate of inspection issued pursuant
to § 179-6 of this Code shall be required for site plan approval.
C. Two-phase site plan approval for nonresidential projects.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Subsection B above, where a
proposed nonresidential development project may involve a number of
buildings or uses to be developed over a period of time, the Planning
Board is authorized to review the site plan in two distinct phases.
(1) The first phase, called conceptual site plan review, shall consider
the general parameters of the total proposed development,
including total square footage of floor area, range of anticipated
uses, traffic access and internal circulation, site buffering, sewer
and water demands, parking requirements, and other relevant
issues as determined by the Planning Board. The application for
§ 223-25 BEACON CODE § 223-25
220:862
conceptual site plan approval shall contain the information set
forth in Subsection B, but at a conceptual level. After review,
and environmental compliance pursuant to Subsection F below,
the Planning Board may grant a conceptual site plan approval,
which shall set forth the parameters of the development approved,
and any specific conditions or criteria under which future actions,
including subdivisions, or project-specific site plans for individual
elements of the conceptual site plan, will be undertaken, reviewed,
and approved, including requirements for any subsequent SEQR
compliance in accordance with Subsection F below. There shall be
no vesting granted to any applicant by virtue of the adoption of
conceptual site plan approval by the Planning Board.
(2) The second phase, called the project-specific phase, will include all
elements not previously reviewed and approved as part of the
conceptual review. These could include, in appropriate cases, but
are not limited to details of site grading, architectural review,
landscaping, parking compliance, etc.
(3) Subsequent to conceptual site plan approval by the Planning Board
of the overall site area, owners may subdivide the site forming lots
and/or buildings, provided that sufficient parking in accordance
with § 223-26 of this chapter is included on each lot or is made
available to support the use on each lot in a manner satisfactory to
the Planning Board, and that no development within any lot will be
permitted except as shown on a site plan approved by the Planning
Board. Provisions satisfactory to the Planning Board for
maintenance of all elements of the site plan shall also be a
prerequisite for any subdivision of the overall site area. The
standards as referred to in § 223-17D shall apply to the overall site
area, whether or not the same is or will continue to be under one
ownership, so long as all of such land is contiguous, with the
exception of any streets or driveways separating any part of such
land from any other part. To the extent that the provisions of this
subsection conflict with the provisions of § 223-12, the provisions of
this subsection shall be controlling.
D. Referral of application to Planning Board. Each application requiring
site development plan approval, together with the required information
described in Subsection B above, shall be referred to the Planning
Board by the Building Inspector within five days of the date of
application. Within 60 days of the date of the first Planning Board
meeting on or after the date of referral, the Planning Board shall
forward its recommendation to the Building Inspector, the City
Engineer, and the applicant, and shall indicate whether the application
should be approved, disapproved or approved with modifications and
shall specify what modifications, if any, are necessary.
E. Considerations. In acting on any site development plan application, the
Planning Board shall take into consideration the recommendations of
the City Development Plan, the proposed location, height and bulk of
§ 223-25 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-25
220:863
buildings, traffic circulation within and without the site, provision of
off-street parking spaces, exterior lighting, buffer areas and other open
spaces, drainage improvement in accordance with § 223-25G of this
chapter and display of signs, so that any development will have a
harmonious relationship with the existing or permitted development of
contiguous land and of adjacent neighborhoods, and so that pedestrian
and vehicular traffic will be handled adequately and safely within the
site and in relation to the adjoining street system.
F. Environmental quality review.
(1) The Planning Board shall comply with SEQR prior to granting any
approvals, on a generic or site-specific basis, as appropriate.
Conceptual site plan reviews shall require SEQR analysis on a
generic basis, which may be broader and more general than sitespecific
SEQR analysis, but may also include an assessment of
project-specific impacts if such details are available. The generic
analysis may identify the important elements of the natural
resource base, and existing and projected features, patterns and
character. It may discuss in general terms the constraints and
consequences of any narrowing of future options. It may present
and analyze, in general terms, hypothetical scenarios that could
and are likely to occur.
(2) The generic analysis should set forth specific conditions or criteria
under which future actions will be undertaken, reviewed, and
approved, including requirements for any subsequent SEQR
compliance. These conditions may include thresholds and criteria
for supplemental SEQR analysis regarding site-specific impacts of
certain scenarios, or potential alternatives, which were not
previously addressed in the generic SEQR analysis. Further, any
site-specific environmental impacts not previously addressed in the
conceptual review shall be addressed in the project-specific phase.
G. Drainage requirements.
(1) The developer may be required by the reviewing authority to carry
away by pipe or open ditch any spring or surface water that may
exist either previous to or as a result of the project. Such drainage
facilities shall be located in the street right-of-way, where feasible,
or in perpetual unobstructed easements of appropriate width and
shall be constructed in accordance with the City Construction
Standards and Specifications.
(2) If a project contains an existing drainage channel conveying
surface water from an off-site upstream drainage area, the
developer shall be required to provide for the conveyance of such
surface water runoff through the project. Drainage pipes and/or
other conveyance facilities shall be provided large enough, in each
project and for each existing drainage channel, to convey potential
runoff from the entire upstream drainage area through the project,
§ 223-25 BEACON CODE § 223-25
220:864
based on a one-hundred-year storm. The intent of this provision is
to maintain the existing watershed drainage pattern as closely as
possible and to safely convey stormwater runoff from the upstream
drainage area through the project. Further, the developer shall
also be required to install drainage pipes and/or other conveyance
facilities in the project to accommodate on-site-generated
stormwater runoff which traverses the project for a twenty-fiveyear
storm based on post-development conditions.
(3) The reviewing authority may require the developer to prepare a
study of the effects of the project on existing downstream drainage
facilities based on the one-hundred-year storm. Where such study
or the reviewing authority, after an independent analysis,
determines that the additional runoff resulting from the
development of the project will adversely impact existing
downstream properties or drainage facilities, the reviewing
authority may withhold approval until provision has been made for
the correction of said potential condition. An acceptable corrective
provision may be the addition of on-site retention and/or detention
of the increased post-development stormwater runoff from the
project so that there would be no net increase in the peak rate of
stormwater runoff over the projects predevelopment rate.
(4) The applicant shall be responsible for submitting computations to
the City Engineer in sufficient detail to make possible the ready
determination of the adequacy of the proposed drainage facilities,
and the City Engineer shall be responsible for reviewing these and
preparing recommendations for the reviewing authority.
H. Park reservations. [Added 12-5-2011 by L.L. No. 14-2011156]
(1) General standards. The Planning Board may require that a portion
of land subject to site plan approval for a residential use be
reserved for a park or parks suitably located for playground or
other recreational purposes. Such locations shall be as designated
on the City Development Plan or Official Map, or as otherwise
deemed appropriate by the Planning Board. Each reservation shall
be of suitable size, dimensions, topography and general character,
and shall have adequate street or private road access, for the
particular purpose or purposes envisioned by the Planning Board.
The area shall be shown and marked on the site plan as "Reserved
for Park Purposes."
(2) Minimum size. The Planning Board may require the reservation of
up to 10% of the area of the site plan for recreation purposes. In
general, it is desirable that land reserved for park and playground
purposes have an area of at least one acre.
156. Editors Note: This local law also redesignated former Subsections H and I as Subsections
I and J, respectively.
§ 223-25 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-25
220:865
(3) Ownership of park areas. The ownership of reservations for park
purposes shall be clearly indicated on the site plan and established
in a manner satisfactory to the Planning Board so as to assure their
proper future continuation and maintenance. When the Planning
Board requires that an area for park, playground or recreational
purposes be reserved on the site plan, such requirement shall not
constitute an acceptance by the City of such area.
(4) Cash payment in lieu of reservation. If the Planning Board
determines that a suitable park or parks of adequate size cannot be
properly located on any such site or are otherwise not practical, the
Planning Board may require, as a condition to final approval of any
such site plan, a payment in a sum to be determined by the
approval authority in accordance with the fee schedule on file in
the City Clerks office. Said sum shall be deposited in a trust fund to
be used by the City Council exclusively for neighborhood park,
playground, or recreational purposes, including but not limited to
the acquisition of land.
(5) Referral. In the event the Planning Board intends to require a
reservation of parkland, the Planning Board shall request a report
and recommendation from the City Council as to the reservation of
such land for park or recreation purposes.
(6) If the land included in a site plan under review is a portion of a
subdivision plat which has been reviewed and approved pursuant
to § 195-25 of the City Code, the applicant shall be credited for any
land set aside or money donated in lieu thereof under such
subdivision plat approval.
I. Public hearing(s). [Amended 5-2-2016 by L.L. No. 7-2016]
(1) A public hearing shall be held by the Planning Board on each site
development plan application. Notice of said hearing shall be
provided by the applicant in accordance with § 223-61.3 of this
chapter. With respect to the two-phase site plan approval process
for nonresidential projects provided for in Subsection C above, a
public hearing shall be held by the Planning Board during both the
conceptual and project-specific phases, respectively.
J. Expiration of approval. At the time of approving the site development
plan, the Planning Board may set forth the time period in which
construction is to begin and be completed. The Planning Board may, in
its discretion, extend any time period it has previously set where it finds
that changing market conditions or other circumstances have acted to
prevent the timely commencement or completion of work, and that the
developer has proceeded with reasonable diligence in an effort to
assure completion of the work within the permitted time period. The
extension of these time periods shall not require the holding of a new
public hearing. [Added 9-15-2003 by L.L. No. 14-2003]
§ 223-25 BEACON CODE § 223-26
220:866
§ 223-26. Off-street parking, loading and vehicular access.
A. General.
(1) All structures and land uses hereafter erected, enlarged, created or
extended shall be provided with the amount of off-street automobile
parking space and loading and unloading space required by the
terms of this section to meet the needs of persons making use of
such structures or land. A permit for the erection, replacement,
reconstruction, extension or substantial alteration of a structure or
the development of a land use shall not be issued unless off-street
automobile parking facilities and, where required loading and
unloading spaces shall have been laid out in plan in accordance
with the appropriate requirements for structures and uses as set
forth in this section, and such required parking and loading
facilities shall be completed before a certificate of occupancy shall
be issued. As used herein, "parking facilities" shall be construed to
include loading and unloading spaces required by this section.
(2) In case of exceptional difficulty or unusual hardship to such
properties arising out of the requirements of this section, the Board
of Appeals may reduce the parking requirements but shall require
such degree of compliance as it may deem reasonable for that part
of the structure or use that is legally nonconforming and shall not
waive any part of the requirement for that part of the structure or
use that constitutes an enlargement or expansion and shall not
permit reduction or elimination of whatever quantity of parking
may already exist, unless it is in excess of requirements.
(3) Required off-street parking facilities which, after development, are
later dedicated to and accepted by the City shall be deemed to
continue to serve the uses or structures for which they were
originally provided.
B. Effect on existing uses.
(1) Structures and land uses in existence on April 20, 1964, or
structures and uses for which building permits had been approved
on or before said date, shall not be subject to the requirements set
forth in this section, unless there shall occur an increased intensity
of use, provided that any parking facilities now existing to serve
such structures or uses shall not in the future be reduced, except
where they exceed such requirement, in which case they may not
be reduced below such requirement.
(2) Whenever a building or structure erected prior to or after April 20,
1964. or any land use shall undergo any increase in intensity of use
in the number of dwelling units, floor area, seating capacity,
number of employees or other unit of measurement specified
hereinafter for required parking facilities, or from other causes,
and further when said increase would result in a requirement for
additional parking facilities through application of the Schedule of
§ 223-26 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-26
220:867
Off-Street Parking Requirements (Subsection F), additional parking
facilities shall be provided accordingly, except that no building or
structure erected prior to said date shall be required to provide
parking facilities unless the aforesaid additional required facilities
amount to a cumulative total increase of at least 25% over the
existing use as of said date, in which case parking spaces shall be
provided on the basis of the total units of measurements of the new
use or of the alteration or expansion of the existing use.
C. Location, use, design, construction and maintenance. [Amended
5-19-2014 by L.L. No. 6-2014; 5-15-2017 by L.L. No. 7-2017]
(1) Location. The off-street parking facilities which are required by this
section shall be provided on the same lot or premises with such
structure or land use; except that off-street parking spaces
required for structures or land uses on two or more adjoining lots
may be provided in a single common facility on one or more of said
lots, provided that a binding agreement, in a form approved by the
Corporation Counsel, assuring the continued operation of said
parking facility during the life of the structure or the land use the
parking is designed to serve, is filed on the land records prior to
approval of the plans for said parking facility. In any residence
district, no off-street parking facility shall be developed in any
required front yard or in any required side or rear yard adjacent to
a street line or in any other side or rear yard within five feet of the
lot line. However, off-street parking spaces shall be permitted in
residential districts as indicated in § 223-17C.
(2) Parking specifications.
(a) Each parking space provided in an unenclosed area shall be at
least nine feet wide and at least 18 feet long, except that the
Planning Board, in approving a plan under § 223-25, may
permit that portion of the total required parking which is
specifically set aside for and limited to employee parking to
have a width of at least 8 1/2 feet and a depth of at least 18
feet. This possible exception shall not be permitted in the CB
District.
(b) Each parking space which is bordered by walls or columns on
two or more sides shall be not less than 10 feet wide nor less
than 18 feet long. Enclosed or garaged parking areas shall not
contain any columns, walls or other obstacles which would
prevent or obstruct the use of any parking space.
(c) The maneuvering area needed to permit parked vehicles to
enter and exit off-street parking spaces shall have a width of at
least 24 feet, except where the Planning Board approves a
lesser distance as adequate for areas with parallel or angled
parking spaces.
§ 223-26 BEACON CODE § 223-26
220:868
(3) Landscaping. Except for parking spaces accessory to a one-family
dwelling, all off-street parking areas shall be landscaped with
appropriate trees, shrubs and other plant materials and ground
cover, as approved by the Planning Board based upon consideration
of the adequacy of the proposed landscaping to assure the
establishment of a safe, convenient and attractive parking facility
with a minimum amount of maintenance, including plant care,
snowplowing and the removal of leaves and other debris. At least
one tree with a minimum caliper of three inches at a height of four
feet above ground level shall be provided within such parking area
for each 10 parking spaces.
(a) Wherever possible, planting islands, at least eight feet in
width, shall be provided to guide vehicle movement and to
separate opposing rows of parking spaces so as to provide
adequate space for plant growth, pedestrian circulation and
vehicle overhang. Such planting islands and the landscaping
within them shall be designed and arranged in such a way as to
provide vertical definition to major traffic circulation aisles,
entrances and exits, to channel internal traffic flow and
prevent indiscriminate diagonal movement of vehicles and to
provide relief from the visual monotony and shadeless expanse
of a large parking area.
(b) The Planning Board may require curbing to facilitate surface
drainage and prevent vehicles from overlapping sidewalks and
damaging landscaping materials.
(c) No obstruction to driver vision shall be erected or maintained
on any lot within the triangle formed by the street line of such
lot, the outer edge of the access driveway to the parking area
and a line drawn between points along such street line and
access drive 30 feet distant from their point of intersection.
(4) Grades, drainage, paving and marking. All proposed and required
parking facilities, regardless of size, shall be graded, surfaced,
drained and maintained throughout the duration of their use so as
to comply with the New York State Stormwater Management
Design Manual, as amended from time to time, and/or Chapter 190,
Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control, of
this Code, or other acceptable stormwater management
practice(s), as deemed suitable to the City Engineer to the extent
necessary to avoid nuisances of dust, erosion or excessive water
flow across public ways or adjacent lands. The drainage analysis for
said parking facilities shall include pre- and post-development
conditions as well as remediation and/or mitigation of stormwater
runoff. The maximum slope within a parking area shall not exceed
5%. In RD and RMF Districts and in nonresidential developments,
the Planning Board shall require the provision of suitable markings
to indicate individual parking spaces, maneuvering area, entrances
and exits.
§ 223-26 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-26
220:869
(5) Traffic circulation. In order to encourage safe and convenient
traffic circulation, the Planning Board may require the
interconnection of parking areas via access drives within and
between adjacent lots. The Board shall require written assurance
and/or deed restrictions, satisfactory to the Corporation Counsel,
binding the owner and his heirs and assignees to permit and
maintain such internal access and circulation and inter-use of
parking facilities.
(6) Two or more uses on same lot. Where two or more different uses
occur on a single lot, the total amount of parking facilities to be
provided shall be the sum of the requirements of each individual
use on the lot, except that the Planning Board may approve the
joint use of parking space by two or more establishments on the
same lot or on contiguous lots, the total capacity of which is less
than the sum of the spaces required for each, provided that said
Board finds that the capacity to be provided will substantially meet
the intent of this article by reason of variation in the probable time
of maximum use by patrons or employees at such establishments
and provided that such approval of such joint use shall be
automatically terminated upon a change of use at any such
establishment.
(7) Designed residence and multifamily residence districts.
(a) In RD and RMF Districts, in order that some of the required
parking spaces may be convenient for use by visitors as well as
by occupants, 2/3 of the required car spaces for a residential
building shall be directly accessible to a main entrance to that
building and within 100 feet of that entrance.
(b) In RD or RMF Districts, off-street parking lots shall be located
behind, underneath, or to the side of the building. Any parking
to the side of the building shall be screened from street views
by a low wall, hedge, fence, and/or other landscaping and,
whenever possible, it shall be located at least 40 feet from any
property line that fronts on a street.
D. Alternatives to providing parking spaces. [Amended 6-15-1992 by
L.L. No. 5-1992]
(1) Conveyance of land. Where, because of limitations of size,
dimensions or topography of a lot, an applicant for a building
permit in a business district finds it impractical to provide all or a
portion of the off-street parking spaces required by Subsection F
herein, in connection with a proposed building or addition, he may
grant and convey to the City of Beacon, and the City Council, at its
discretion, may accept, appropriately located and developed land
for commercial parking as a permitted use equivalent, provided
that said land is permanently dedicated to the City.157

Other uses not listed Amended
5-2-2005 by L.L. No. 2-2005]
Off-street parking requirements
for types of uses which do not fall
within the categories listed above
shall be determined by the
Planning Board upon
consideration of relevant factors
entering into the parking needs of
each such use
(1) Notwithstanding § 223-26F above, with respect to lots which, on
the effective date of this section, are located wholly or partially
within 2,500 feet of the train station platform, the City Council shall
have the authority to limit the amount of parking to be provided for
multifamily and nonresidential development projects on said lots
having a parking requirement in accordance with § 223-26F of 25
spaces or more, in the interest of appropriately and reasonably
minimizing the environmental impact of the project's vehicular
traffic accessing the train station. In such cases, the City Council
shall ensure that convenient pedestrian access is provided by the
project, or is otherwise available between the project and the train
station. Where a substantial change in elevation exists between the
project and the train station, the City Council may require the
project to provide, if deemed feasible by the Council, an elevator,

amendment to this section.
I. Driveways. For reasons of traffic and pedestrian safety, both on and off
street, as well as to provide for possible future road widening or other
improvements, all new driveways and sidewalk crossings entering onto
any street shall comply with all requirements of Chapter 100,
Driveways, and shall be subject to the approval of the Highway
Superintendent, except where such are part of a use subject to special
permit or site development plan approval, in accordance with §§ 223-18

on the open front porch: household furnishings, fixtures or equipment
designed, manufactured or intended for indoor use, appliances,
building materials, tools and equipment, auto body parts, new or used
vehicle parts, lawn maintenance equipment, animal houses or shelters,
compost piles, trampolines, swing sets and other similar play
equipment, logs and long, thick sections of trimmed but unhewn timber,
and packaged fuels such as pellets.
B. Utility trailers; all-terrain vehicles; snowmobiles; jet skis.
(1) At all times, except as temporarily required for loading and
unloading, the storage on residential property of registered utility
trailers shall be limited to a total of two per dwelling unit.
Unregistered utility trailers shall not be stored on residential
property.
(2) All-terrain vehicles, snowmobiles and jet skis shall be stored in an
enclosed garage or the rear yard, unless such item is fully screened
by landscaping or opaque fencing.
C. Cut and split firewood must be neatly stacked and shall be permitted in
the rear yard only.
A. Findings. The City of Beacon City Council hereby finds that the practice
of tattoo artistry is a form of art likeable to other forms of artistic
expression, such as painting and drawing, and accordingly, should be
welcomed within the City. The Council further recognizes, however,
that the establishments that provide tattooing services are sometimes
the location of activities that may be regarded as inappropriate for
individuals of sensitive ages or offensive to personal morals. For these
reasons, the Council finds that modest regulation of tattoo parlors
within the City is necessary to encourage the spread of contemporary
forms of artistic expression and to ensure the health, safety and general
well-being of the City and its inhabitants.
B. Definitions. As used in this section, the following terms shall have the
meanings indicated:
APPLICANT  Any person, corporation or business who applies for a

E. Suitable improvement, sanitation and exterior storage. The lot on which
the retail sales truck(s) is located shall be suitably improved to the
satisfaction of the Planning Board, and shall be maintained in a safe,
clean and litter-free manner at all times. The retail sales operator shall
not discharge grease, liquids or any other items or materials onto the
sidewalk, street, tree pits, sanitary sewer system, stormwater inlets or

§ 223-26.3 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-26.3
220:879
on-site utilities be required, the retail sales operator shall be required
to apply for appropriate permits to ensure compliance with applicable
building codes. Said truck shall be maintained in good repair at all
times. The siting and operation of said truck shall be a temporary use,
shall not become a fixture of the site and shall not be considered an

sign area on the lot. Said signage shall be professionally prepared or its
equivalent. Notwithstanding the use of the words "building" and
"structure" in the definition of "sign area" in § 223-63 of this chapter,
said definition shall apply to retail sales trucks.
L. Parking. A minimum of two off-street parking spaces shall be provided
for this use. Said off-street parking shall be suitably improved and
screened to the satisfaction of the Planning Board. Notwithstanding the
above, the parking requirement may be modified or eliminated by said
Board, in its discretion, based upon information submitted by the
applicant or otherwise in the public record, demonstrating that there is
sufficient public parking available within 800 feet of the site to meet the
foreseeable parking needs of the proposed use and surrounding uses.
M. Aesthetics. There shall be no display of banners, streamers or any other
elements designed or intended to attract attention to the retail sales
truck site other than permitted signage. In reviewing the application for
site development plan approval for this use, the Planning Board may
attach conditions to its approval for the purpose of mitigating visual
impact.
N. Removal of truck. If the retail sales truck is removed from the lot, all
other evidence of the retail sales operation shall be removed as well.

In the event that the inspection indicates that the use is no longer
in compliance, the certificate of compliance shall be revoked until the
violation(s) is cured.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish uniform policies and
procedures for the deployment and installation of small cell wireless
telecommunication facilities (small cell facility) in the City of Beacon,

(b) In acting on any site development plan application, the
Planning Board shall take into consideration any approved
special permit, the proposed design and layout of the entire
waterfront area, including the proposed location, height and
bulk of buildings, traffic circulation within and without the site,
provision of off-street parking space, exterior lighting,
landscaping, buffer areas and open spaces, display of signs and
architecture and design so that any development will have a
harmonious relationship with the existing or permitted
development of contiguous land and of adjacent
neighborhoods, and so that pedestrian and vehicular traffic
will be handled adequately and safely within the site and in
relation to the adjoining street system. Particularly, the
Planning Board shall assure that the proposed site plan meets
the waterfront park standards set forth in Subsection I.
(3) Time period for construction. At the time of approving the site plan,
the Planning Board may set forth the time period in which
construction is to begin and be completed. The Planning Board
may, in its discretion, extend any time period it has previously set

(4) Adjustments to site plan during construction. During the
construction of an approved site plan, the Building Inspector or the
City Engineer may authorize minor adjustments to the approved
plans which are consistent with the approved site plan when such
adjustments appear necessary in the light of technical or
engineering considerations which develop during actual
construction, or when such adjustments are required in order to
comply with law, rules or regulations made applicable to the
subject property by any agency or instrumentality of the United
States, New York State, Dutchess County or City government. The
Building Inspector or City Engineer may, in his discretion, refer any
such proposed change to the Planning Board for review. The
Planning Board may determine to treat the modification as a minor
site plan adjustment under this section or to treat it as a site plan
amendment under Subsection G(5). If treated as a minor site plan
adjustment, the Planning Board may authorize the Engineer or
Building Inspector to approve the requested change.
(5) Site plan amendments. If the Planning Board determines that the
character of the proposed changes requires a site plan amendment,
the Planning Board shall process the application as an amended
site plan under this Subsection G and shall have discretion to
determine the extent of further environmental analysis and project
§ 223-41.3 BEACON CODE § 223-41.3

review any proposed subdivision applications within a Waterfront Park
project at any time. Any requests for subdivision approval shall follow
the procedures set forth in the City of Beacon's Subdivision
Regulations.167
J. Waterfront park standards. Because the Waterfront Park area is a
central element in the City's waterfront, it is essential that any
proposed site plans meet the following standards:
(1) Relationship to uses on surrounding property. The land uses in a
Waterfront Park project shall relate, visually and functionally, with
surrounding land areas, including Long Dock, Riverfront Park,
Dennings Point, Federal Paperboard property and the Metro-North
Train Station. Elements of the project site plan, particularly those
at the entrance, shall relate compatibly with other elements of the
City waterfront.

shall also be sensitive to the site's relationship to the river and shall
be designed accordingly.
(3) Provision of view corridors. The site shall be developed in such a
way as to maximize important views and to provide view
opportunities at the river's edge and view corridors throughout the
development. Site layout and design shall consider view corridors
identified in the LWRP and shall also consider important views from
Riverfront Park and from the Hudson River toward the shore.
Important views should be protected and enhanced to the
maximum extent practicable.
(4) Architectural design standards.
(a) The various elements of the project shall be integrated by
cohesive architectural treatment and compatible design.
(b) Buildings shall be designed in consideration of appearance
from all vantage points.
(c) Architectural elements shall be used to provide visual interest,
reduce apparent scale of the development and promote
integration of the various design elements in the project.
(d) Groups of related buildings shall be designed to present a
compatible appearance in terms of architectural style.
167. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision of Land.
§ 223-41.3 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.3
220:901
(e) Building lines shall be varied to the extent practicable in order
to provide an interesting interplay of buildings and open
spaces.

mechanical equipment or water towers, carports, garages or
storage buildings, shall receive architectural treatment
consistent with that of principal buildings.
(5) Energy efficiency. The plan for development of any Waterfront Park
project shall be designed and arranged in such a way as to promote
energy efficiency to the maximum extent practicable for all
buildings.
(6) Landscaping, screening and buffering.
(a) All sidewalks, open spaces, parking areas, boat storage areas
and service areas shall be landscaped and/or paved in a
manner which will harmonize with proposed buildings.
Materials for paving, walls, fences, curbs, benches, etc., will be
attractive, durable, easily maintained and compatible with the
exterior materials of adjacent buildings.
(b) The Planning Board may require buffer landscaping, fencing or
screening, to separate land uses and to screen utility buildings,
refuse collection areas, cooling systems and other similar
installations and features.
(c) All plants, trees and shrubs shall be installed in accordance
with a planting schedule provided by the developer and
approved by the Planning Board. Landscape materials selected
shall be appropriate to the growing conditions of the shoreline
environment and this climatic zone.
(7) Lighting. Streets, drives, walks and other outdoor areas shall be
properly lighted to promote safety and encourage pedestrian use.
All exterior lighting for the project shall be directed downward or
otherwise appropriately shielded and designed to minimize
excessive light. It shall have an attractive appearance compatible
with the overall project design and waterfront character. Lighting
type, number and locations shall be subject to Planning Board
review and approval as part of the site plan review.
(8) Signage.
(a) All signs shall be planned and designed in accordance with an
overall comprehensive signage plan, which shall be subject to
Planning Board review and approval as part of site plan review.
(b) All signs shall be of a size and scale as determined appropriate
by the Planning Board to accomplish their intended purpose.
§ 223-41.3 BEACON CODE § 223-41.3
220:902
(9) Vehicular circulation system and traffic access. The rights-of-way
and pavement widths for all internal streets, drives, walks or other
accessways for vehicles and/or pedestrians shall be determined on
the basis of sound current planning and engineering standards,
which shall accommodate projected demand but minimize
impervious surface to the maximum extent possible.
(10) Public access. Waterfront Park developments should be
encouraged to provide pedestrian public access in a manner which:
(a) Enhances existing public access opportunities at the
riverfront, in furtherance of the LWRP and the state's coastal
policies; and
(b) Coordinates such public access with existing or anticipated
opportunities for public access on adjacent lands to facilitate
further linkages in a continuous pedestrian path system.
(11)Off-street parking and loading:
(a) General parking requirements.
[1] Off-street parking and loading areas shall be designed with
careful regard to their relationship to the uses served and
to the objectives for other open spaces. They shall be
coordinated with the public street system serving the
project in order to avoid conflicts with through traffic or
obstruction to pedestrian walks.
[2] Parking and loading facilities not enclosed in structures
shall be suitably landscaped and/or screened as
determined appropriate by the Planning Board.
(b) Parking requirements:
[1] Marina: 1/2 space per slip or dry rack storage unit.
[2] Museums, educational facilities, auditorium, athletic field
or other place of assembly: One space for each four seats
or pew spaces or, in places without seats, one space for
each 100 square feet of floor space used for public
assembly.
(c) With respect to any building, structure or use for which the
required number of parking spaces is not specifically set forth
in the above schedule, the Planning Board in the course of site
plan review shall determine the number of off-street parking
spaces required, which number shall bear a reasonable
relation to the minimum off-street parking requirements for
specified uses as set forth in the above schedule.
§ 223-41.3 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.3
220:903
(d) Up to 30% of the required parking may be designated for
compact automobiles at the discretion of and in accordance
with standards as determined by the Planning Board.
(e) Alternative methods of meeting off-street parking
requirements.
[1] General.
[a] The waterfront area will include a mix of land uses on
the waterfront, wherein the cumulative parking
demand is less than the sum of the peak demand
values for each individual land use. This makes it
possible to share parking without conflict and to avoid
a large surplus of parking spaces in the waterfront
area.
[b] Also, because of the special nature and value of land
along the waterfront, and because of the anticipated
mix of land uses, alternative parking solutions, such as
valet parking, off-site parking, etc., may, in certain
situations, also be appropriate.
[2] Planning Board authority. The Planning Board shall be
authorized to find that any portion of the off-street parking
requirements of a Waterfront Park project have been
satisfied when the applicant establishes to the Board's
satisfaction that alternative parking solutions are
appropriate and will provide adequate parking for the
project. If an applicant wishes to use alternative parking
methods, he must submit a complete analysis to the Board
for review. This analysis must include estimates of peak
parking demands for different land uses for different hours
of the day and days of the week. It should also define
strategies intended to incorporate alternative parking
methods and the advantages of such strategies.
[3] Alternative parking methods. Alternative parking methods
include the following, and such other methods as the
Planning Board deems appropriate, or any combination
thereof:
[a] Parking shared among various use elements within a
Waterfront Park project.
[b] Provisions of parking off-site, in private or municipal
lots, where appropriate arrangements for such
parking can be made.
[c] Valet parking.

(f) Off-street loading. Off-street loading shall be provided as the
Planning Board may find appropriate.
(12) On-site utilities and services.
(a) Underground lines. All on-site power and communication lines,
as well as on-site water, sewer and storm drainage lines, shall
be installed underground in the manner prescribed by the
regulations of the government agency or utility company
having jurisdiction. Any utility equipment which will be
necessarily located above ground will be adequately screened
from view in an attractive manner.
(b) Approval of appropriate jurisdiction. All buildings within the
Waterfront Park projects shall be served by water supply,
sanitary sewage and stormwater drainage systems as
approved by the appropriate government agency or agencies
having jurisdiction thereof. Stormwater drainage shall
minimize siltation and nonpoint source discharge of salted
areas.
(c) Television hookups. Television hookups shall either be by cable
television or a central antenna system designed to minimize
adverse aesthetic impact.
(d) Refuse collection. Waterfront Park projects shall provide an
adequate means of separation, and storing refuse between
collections, which shall comply with all applicable City
requirements, including recycling requirements. Such storage
systems shall be designed to minimize adverse aesthetic
impact.
(e) Cooling systems. Cooling systems in any buildings shall be
designed so as to minimize adverse aesthetic impact.
(f) Placement of utilities. Where possible, all utilities shall be
placed within the right-of-way, and all possible steps shall be
taken to avoid placement of utilities under the pavement, in
order to assure ease of future maintenance.

(2) Planning Board review of special permit and waterfront
development concept plan application.
(a) Environmental compliance.
[1] The approval of a waterfront development project is an
action under the State Environmental Quality Review Act,
and all proceedings to review such project shall comply
with applicable requirements of SEQR.
[2] Upon receipt of an application for a special permit and
waterfront development concept plan, the Planning Board
shall commence a coordinated review under SEQR and
institute lead agency procedures after identifying all
involved and interested agencies, as provided by law.
[3] Because any waterfront development will constitute an
important element in the implementation of the City's
Local Waterfront Revitalization Plan, the preparation of a
Draft Environmental Impact Statement shall be required
by the lead agency. Such DEIS shall comply with all
requirements of law. To the extent possible in accordance
with law, the DEIS submitted in connection with the
special permit and waterfront development concept plan
approval shall be sufficiently specific so as to eliminate the
need for additional and/or supplemental DEIS's during the
site plan stage of the approval process.
[4] To the extent possible in accordance with law, the
preparation of the DEIS shall be integrated into the
§ 223-41.4 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.4
220:909
existing agency review processes and should occur at the
same time as the other agency reviews, including the
special permit and waterfront development concept plan
review. When a SEQR hearing is to be held, it should
be conducted jointly with other public hearings on the
proposed action, whenever practicable.
[5] Notwithstanding Subsection F(2)(a)[1] through [4]
immediately above, where a waterfront development
project includes a phase (or phases) comprised solely of
uses permitted in the Waterfront Park District, and where
a lead agency has been established and has scoped a DEIS
for the overall waterfront development project, said phase
(or phases) may be segmented for the purposes of
environmental review in accordance with the provisions of
SEQR. In such case, the lead agency shall require the
preparation of a full environmental assessment form (EAF)
for its use in rendering a determination of significance
regarding said phase(s). Further, the lead agency shall
notify all involved and interested agencies that the
phase(s) will be segmented and shall send a copy of the
EAF with said notification.
(b) Special permit approval. The Planning Board may authorize
the issuance of a special permit for a waterfront development
project, provided that it shall find that the following conditions
and standards have been met:
[1] The proposed waterfront development project will fulfill
the purposes of the waterfront development zone.
[2] The proposed waterfront development project meets the
Waterfront Development Design Standards set forth in
§ 223-41.4J, to the extent applicable at the special permit
stage.
[3] The proposed waterfront development project will be in
harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of
the City's waterfront area.
[4] The proposed waterfront development project will not
hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use
of adjacent lands.
[5] The proposed land uses will be in accordance with the
approved waterfront development concept plan.
[6] The proposed waterfront development uses meet the
standards of § 223-41.4B.
[7] The proposed project is otherwise in the public interest.
§ 223-41.4 BEACON CODE § 223-41.4
220:910
(c) Conditions. In approving any waterfront development concept
plan and special permit, the Planning Board may attach such
conditions, safeguards and mitigation measures as it deems
necessary or appropriate to assure continual conformance to
all applicable standards and requirements and to fulfill the
intent and purposes of this chapter.
(3) (Reserved)
(4) Time periods for development pursuant to special permit. At the
time of approving a special permit, the Planning Board may set
forth the time period in which construction is to begin and be
completed. The Planning Board may, in its discretion, extend any
time period it has previously set where it finds that changing
market conditions or other circumstances have acted to prevent
the timely commencement or completion of work, and that the
developer has proceeded with reasonable diligence in an effort to
assure completion of the work within the permitted time period.
The extension of these time periods shall not require the holding of
a new public hearing.
(5) Revisions to waterfront development special permit. After approval
of a waterfront park special permit, any proposed revisions in the
approved special permit shall be submitted to the Planning Board
or its designee. The Planning Board, in its discretion, shall
determine the appropriate procedures for consideration of the
proposed revisions, and whether such revision is material enough
to require further environmental analysis, further project review
and/or a further hearing, as it may deem appropriate.
(6) Processing of phases comprised of Waterfront Park District uses.
Notwithstanding other provisions of the waterfront development
review and approval process, where a waterfront development
project includes a phase (or phases) comprised solely of uses
permitted in the Waterfront Park District, the Planning Board may
process and grant special permit approval to said phase(s) in
advance of the complete processing of the overall project so long as
the SEQR process has been complied with in accordance with the
provisions of § 223-41.4F(2)(a)[5] herein; said phase is an integral
part of an appropriate waterfront development concept plan, as
determined by the Planning Board; and the overall review and
approval process for waterfront development special permits as
outlined herein, including all referrals and hearings, has been
complied with for said phase(s). After the granting of special permit
approval, said phase(s) may proceed to site development plan
review and approval for said phase(s) in accordance with
Subsection H immediately below.
H. Site development plan review. After approval of the waterfront
development special permit the Planning Board may grant site plan
§ 223-41.4 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.4
220:911
approval to a waterfront development project. [Amended 4-3-2017 by
L.L. No. 5-2017]
(1) Application for site plan approval. The application for site
development plan approval shall contain all the material set forth in
§ 223-25B of this Zoning Ordinance. In addition, the applicant shall
submit the following:
(a) Information to establish that the proposed site plan meets the
waterfront development standards set forth in Subsection I.
(b) Information to establish that the proposed site plan is in
substantial conformance with the approved waterfront
development concept plan.
(c) Preliminary elevations showing the general architectural and
design treatment of all buildings, public and open spaces and
other site plan elements.
(d) Information to establish the relationship of the proposed
project to later elements of the development of the site,
including any other adjacent and nearby lands that are not part
of the applicant's planned waterfront development projects.
(e) Such other information as the Planning Board may reasonably
require in order to evaluate the site plan application.
(f) Application fees as may be required pursuant to Subsection E.
(2) Planning Board review of site plan.
(a) The Planning Board shall conduct a detailed review of the
adequacy, location, arrangement, design and appearance of
each aspect of the proposed development. While the scope of
the Planning Board's review of the site plan will generally
relate to the waterfront project at issue, the Planning Board
shall have the authority to assure that aspects of the overall
development of the site (e.g., stormwater management,
domestic water and fire protection, sanitary sewer, all utilities,
streets, etc.) shall be adequate to suit the purposes and needs
of the entire peninsula, as it is finally developed.
(b) In acting on any site development plan application, the
Planning Board shall take into consideration any approved
special permits and waterfront development concept plans, the
proposed design and layout of the entire waterfront area,
including the proposed location, height and buffer of buildings,
traffic circulation within and without the site, provision of offstreet
parking, exterior lighting, display of signs, landscaping,
buffer areas and open spaces and architecture and design, so
that any development will have a harmonious relationship with
the existing or permitted development of contiguous land and
§ 223-41.4 BEACON CODE § 223-41.4
220:912
of adjacent neighborhoods, and so that pedestrian and
vehicular traffic will be handled adequately and safely within
the site and in relation to the adjoining street system.
Particularly, the Planning Board shall assure that the proposed
site plan meets the waterfront development standards set forth
in Subsection I.
(c) The proposed site development plan shall be in general
conformance with the waterfront development concept plan.
While the waterfront development concept plan approval will
approve a general layout on the site, the individual site plans
for particular waterfront development projects will provide
detailed building envelopes, elevations and site design details
regarding proposals for various projects within the site. The
Planning Board may exercise its discretion in allowing minor
variations from the waterfront development concept plan so
long as the site plan is, in the Planning Board's judgment,
generally in keeping with the waterfront development concept
plan. In no case, however, shall the Planning Board have the
authority to approve a total number of dwelling units or total
density in the waterfront development which exceeds the
number approved as part of the special permit and waterfront
development concept plan. Nor shall the Planning Board have
the authority to approve the total square footage of
nonresidential space above that approved in the special
permit.
(3) Time period for construction. At the time of approving the site plan,
the Planning Board may set forth the time period in which
construction is to begin and be completed. The Planning Board
may, in its discretion, extend any time period it has previously set
where it finds that changing market conditions or other
circumstances have acted to prevent the timely commencement or
completion of work, and that the developer has proceeded with
reasonable diligence in an effort to assure completion of the work
within the permitted time period. The extension of these time
periods shall not require the holding of a new public hearing.
(4) Adjustments to site plan during construction. During the
construction of an approved site plan, the Building Inspector or the
City Engineer may authorize minor adjustments to the approved
plans which are consistent with the overall approved site plan,
when such adjustments appear necessary in the light of technical
or engineering considerations which develop during actual
construction, or when such adjustments are required in order to
comply with law, rules or regulations made applicable to the
subject property by any agency or instrumentality of the United
States, New York State, Dutchess County or City government. The
Building Inspector or City Engineer may, in his discretion, refer any
such proposed change to the Planning Board for review. The
§ 223-41.4 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.4
220:913
Planning Board may determine to treat the modification as a minor
site plan adjustment under this section or to treat it as a site plan
amendment under Subsection G(5). If treated as a minor site plan
adjustment, the Planning Board may authorize the Engineer or
Building Inspector to approve the requested change.
(5) Site plan amendments. If the Planning Board determines that the
character of the proposed changes requires a site plan amendment,
the Planning Board shall process the application as an amended
site plan under this Subsection G(5) and shall have discretion to
determine the extent of further environmental analysis and project
review that is required. After appropriate review, the Planning
Board shall approve the site plan amendment by resolution.
I. Subdivision within a waterfront development. The Planning Board may
review any proposed subdivision applications within a waterfront
development at any time. Any requests for subdivision approval shall
follow the procedures set forth in the City of Beacon's Subdivision
Regulations.170 The bulk standards, setbacks and other dimensional
requirements of the WD Zone shall apply to the gross land area of the
total waterfront development, whether or not the gross land area is or
will remain in one ownership, and shall not apply to individual or
subdivided lots.
J. Development standards for Waterfront Development District. It is
essential that development in this district meet the following
development standards: [Amended 4-3-2017 by L.L. No. 5-2017]
(1) Comprehensive design. The WD Zone allows for flexibility of design
to encourage innovative site planning and creative use of the two
areas specified: north area and south area. While the WD north
area is expected to contain residential development, the southern
portion of the district is expected to contain various elements of
mixed-use development (e.g., residential, commercial, retail,
cultural, etc.). Each area must be planned with a comprehensive
plan for ingress, egress, circulation and utility service. The
architectural styles of various buildings must be compatible within
each portion of the WD district and must attain high standards of
design.
(2) Relationship to river and MNRR station. All elements of a project
within the WD Zone shall also be sensitive to the site's relationship
to the river and the MNRR station, and shall be designed
accordingly.
(3) Provision of view corridors. The sites shall be developed in such a
way as to preserve important public views from upland locations as
specified but not limited to view corridors identified in the Local
Waterfront Revitalization Program (LWRP). For the WD north area,
170. Editor's Note: See Ch. 195, Subdivision of Land.
§ 223-41.4 BEACON CODE § 223-41.4
220:914
building rooflines should step down, from north to south, to follow
contour and elevation of the topography directly to the east of the
development site. For the WD south area, building roofline should
step down, from east to west, to protect views from Beekman and
River Streets to maximum extent practicable. No building shall be
taller than 32 feet above grade at the curb line of Beekman Street.
(4) Architectural design standards.
(a) The various elements of any project shall be integrated by
cohesive architectural treatment and compatible design.
(b) Buildings shall be designed in consideration of appearance
from all vantage points.
(c) Architectural elements shall be used to provide visual interest,
reduce apparent scale of the development and promote
integration of the various design elements in the project.
(d) Groups of related buildings shall be designed to present a
compatible appearance in terms of architectural style.
Compatible appearance should seek to achieve non-excessive
difference rather than identical similarity.
(e) Building lines shall be varied to the extent practicable in order
to provide an interesting interplay of buildings and open
spaces.
(f) Appurtenances on buildings and auxiliary structures, such as
mechanical equipment or water towers, parking facilities, or
storage buildings, shall receive architectural treatment and
screening consistent with that of principal buildings.
(g) Parking decks should be screened from public view to
maximum extent practicable, preferably with "green screen"
techniques.
(h) Buildings should have a top-floor cornice feature and first-floor
architectural articulation, such as a storefront with a
secondary cornice or an architecturally emphasized entrance
doorway, to accent the central body of the building.
(i) Wherever practicable, buildings should employ texture or
additional detailing to accentuate the base of buildings and
provide human scale.
(j) Architectural features and windows should be continued on all
sides of the building that are clearly visible from a street or
public parking area, avoiding any blank walls, except in cases
of existing walls or potential common property walls. Larger
buildings shall incorporate significant breaks in the facades
and rooflines at intervals of no more than 35 feet.
§ 223-41.4 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.4
220:915
(k) Primary individual window proportions shall be greater in
height than in width. Mirrored, reflective, or tinted glass, allglass
walls, and exterior roll-down security gates shall not be
permitted. Any shutters shall match the size of the window
opening, appear functional, and be attached to the window
frame.
(l) Building elements that provide additional architectural
interest, such as bay windows, and cornices, but not including
balconies or porches, may encroach up to two feet beyond the
front line if the bottom of the encroaching building elements is
at least 12 feet above grade. [Amended 12-9-2019 by L.L.
No. 12-2019]
(m) Metal, glass or canvas-type awnings and canopies or projecting
signs are encouraged and may encroach up to six feet for
awnings and three feet for signs into the front setback and over
the sidewalk above seven feet. Vinyl awnings are discouraged
unless the applicant can demonstrate to the Planning Board's
satisfaction that the finish and design of such awning are of
high quality, aesthetically pleasing and meet the intended
standards of the district, as determined by said Board.
(n) Buildings shall have a front entrance door facing the primary
street and connected to the sidewalk. Front entrance doors for
commercial buildings and retail storefronts shall be active and
provide main access during business hours.
(o) Commercial buildings shall have at least 70% glass on the firstfloor
facades, located between two feet and 10 feet above the
sidewalk. Residential buildings shall have at least 30% glass on
the first-floor facades.
(p) Finish building materials should be wood, brick, traditional
cement-based stucco, stone or fiber-cement siding or other
material deemed acceptable by the Planning Board. Vinyl,
aluminum or sheet metal siding or sheet trim, exposed
concrete blocks or concrete walls, plywood or other similar
prefabricated panels, unpainted or unstained lumber, synthetic
stone or brick, or synthetic stucco, exterior insulation and
finishing system (EIFS), or direct-applied finish system (DAFS),
and chain link fencing shall not be permitted.
(5) Energy efficiency. The plan for development of any project shall be
designed and arranged in such a way as to promote energy
efficiency to the maximum extent practicable for all buildings. All
buildings should meet or exceed LEED Silver rating or equivalency.
(6) Landscaping, screening and buffering.
(a) All sidewalks, open spaces, parking areas and service areas
shall be landscaped and/or paved in a manner that will
§ 223-41.4 BEACON CODE § 223-41.4
220:916
harmonize with proposed buildings. Materials for paving,
walls, fences, curbs, benches, etc., will be attractive, durable,
easily maintained and compatible with the exterior materials
of adjacent buildings.
(b) The Planning Board may require buffer landscaping, fencing or
screening to separate land uses, and to screen utility buildings,
refuse collection areas, cooling systems and other similar
installations and features.
(c) All plants, trees and shrubs shall be installed in accordance
with a planting schedule provided by the developer and
approved by the Planning Board. Landscape materials selected
shall be appropriate to the growing conditions of the shoreline
environment and this climatic zone.
(7) Lighting. Streets, drives, walks and other outdoor areas shall be
properly lighted to promote safety and encourage pedestrian use.
All exterior lighting for the project shall be directed downward or
otherwise appropriately shielded and designed to minimize
excessive light. It shall have an attractive appearance compatible
with the overall project design and waterfront character. Lighting
type, number and locations shall be subject to Planning Board
review and approval as part of the site plan review.
(a) Lighting fixtures shall be a maximum of 15 feet in height,
except pole lights in rear parking lots shall be a maximum of 20
feet high. Lighting shall be energy efficient, have full spectrum
color quality, and shall prevent any lighting above 60 watts that
directly projects above the horizontal level into the night sky.
(8) Signage.
(a) All signs shall be planned and designed in accordance with an
overall comprehensive signage plan, which shall be subject to
Planning Board review and approval as part of site plan review.
(b) All signs shall be of a size and scale as determined appropriate
by the Planning Board to accomplish their intended purpose.
(9) Vehicular circulation system and traffic access. The rights-of-way
and pavement widths for all internal streets, drives, walks or other
access ways for vehicles and/or pedestrians shall be determined on
the basis of sound current planning and engineering standards,
which shall accommodate projected demand but minimize
impervious surface to the maximum extent possible.
(10) Public access. While development in WD north area is expected to
be primarily residential, development in WD south area is expected
to accommodate public access to the MNRR station and Beacon
waterfront. This will require certain private elements for the
security and benefit of its residents and property owners. A clear
§ 223-41.4 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.4
220:917
boundary should be maintained between publicly accessible and
private space. Development that provides access to the MNRR
train station (i.e. the WD south area) public pedestrian access
should be created in a manner which:
(a) Enhances existing public access opportunities to the
riverfront, in furtherance of the City's Comprehensive Plan and
LWRP and the state's coastal policies.
(b) Coordinates such public access with existing or anticipated
opportunities for public access to the MNRR and Beacon
waterfront west of the railroad tracks.
(c) Provides a public promenade along length of development
facing the river.
(11)Off-street parking and loading.
(a) General parking requirements.
[1] Off-street parking and loading areas shall be designed with
careful regard to their relationship to the uses served and
to the objectives for other open spaces. They shall be
coordinated with the public street system serving the
project in order to avoid conflicts with through traffic or
obstruction to pedestrian walks.
[2] Parking and loading facilities not enclosed in structures
shall be suitably landscaped and/or screened as
determined appropriate by the Planning Board.
(b) Parking requirements.
[1] Multifamily dwelling: one space per unit.
[2] Retail or service business: one space for each 333 square
feet of gross floor, excluding basement storage utility
areas.
[3] Restaurant: one space for each two patron seats or one
space for each 300 square feet of gross floor area,
excluding kitchen and storage areas.
[4] Office for business or professional use: one space for each
350 square feet of gross floor area.
[5] Hotel: 0.75 space for each hotel guest room.
(c) With respect to any building, structure or use for which the
required number of parking spaces is not specifically set forth
in the above schedule, the Planning Board, in the course of site
plan review, shall determine the number of off-street parking
spaces required, which number shall bear a reasonable
§ 223-41.4 BEACON CODE § 223-41.4
220:918
relation to the minimum off-street parking requirements for
specified uses as set forth in the above schedule.
(d) Up to 30% of the required parking may be designated for
compact automobiles at the discretion of and in accordance
with standards as determined by the Planning Board.
(e) Alternative methods of meeting off-street parking
requirements.
[1] General.
[a] The WD Zone encourages a mix of land uses on the
waterfront wherein the cumulative parking demand is
less than the sum of the peak demand values for each
individual land use. This makes it possible to share
parking without conflict and to avoid a large surplus of
parking spaces in the waterfront area.
[b] Also, because of the special nature and value of land
along the waterfront, and because of the anticipated
mix of land uses, alternative parking solutions, such as
valet parking, off-site parking, etc., may, in certain
situations, also be appropriate.
[2] Planning Board authority. The Planning Board shall be
authorized to reduce parking requirements for a given use,
based upon a finding that any portion of the off-street
parking requirements of a waterfront development have
been satisfied when the applicant establishes to the
Board's satisfaction that alternative parking solutions are
appropriate and will provide adequate parking for the WD
site. If an applicant wishes to use alternative parking
methods, he must submit a complete analysis to the Board
for review. This analysis must include estimates of peak
parking demands for different land uses for different hours
of the day and days of the week. It should also define
strategies intended to incorporate alternative parking
methods and the advantages of such strategies.
[3] Alternative parking methods. Alternative parking methods
include the following, and such other methods as the
Planning Board deems appropriate, or any combination
thereof:
[a] Parking shared among various use elements within
the waterfront development. The Planning Board's
acceptance of such an alternative parking method
shall be based on a professional parking study of the
proposed use and the surrounding area that
demonstrates that a different amount of parking
would be appropriate for the use in its particular
§ 223-41.4 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.4
220:919
location and/or that existing and/or proposed off-site
parking is sufficient.
[b] Provision of parking off-site, in private or municipal
lots, where appropriate arrangements for such
parking can be made.
[c] Valet parking.
(f) Off-street loading. Off-street loading shall be provided as the
Planning Board may find appropriate.
(12) On-site utilities and services:
(a) Underground lines. All on-site television, power and
communication lines, as well as on-site water, sewer and storm
drainage lines, shall be installed underground in the manner
prescribed by the regulations of the government agency or
utility company having jurisdiction. Any utility equipment
which will be necessarily located above ground will be
adequately screened from view in an attractive manner.
(b) Approval of appropriate jurisdiction. All buildings within
waterfront development projects shall be served by water
supply, sanitary sewage and stormwater drainage systems as
approved by the appropriate government agency or agencies
having jurisdiction thereof. Stormwater drainage shall
minimize siltation and nonpoint source discharge of salted
areas and any other pollutants. Best management practices
shall be required.
(c) Television hookups. Television hookups shall either be by cable
television or a central antenna system designed to minimize
adverse aesthetic impact.
(d) Refuse collection. The waterfront development shall provide an
adequate means of separation, and storing refuse between
collections, which shall comply with all applicable City
requirements, including recycling requirements. Such storage
systems shall be designed to minimize adverse aesthetic
impact.
(e) Cooling systems. Cooling systems shall be designed so as to
minimize adverse aesthetic impact.
(f) Placement of utilities. Where possible, all utilities shall be
placed within the right-of-way, and all possible steps shall be
taken to avoid placement of utilities under the pavement, in
order to assure ease of future maintenance.
(13) Floodplain. The waterfront development plan shall comply with the
applicable provisions of the Beacon Local Law for Flood Damage
Prevention.171
§ 223-41.4 BEACON CODE § 223-41.5
220:920

ARTICLE IVB
Affordable-Workforce Housing
[Added 11-15-2010 by L.L. No. 15-2010; amended 5-1-2017 by L.L.
No. 6-2017]
§ 223-41.8. Findings.
The City Council of the City of Beacon acknowledges the high cost of
housing compared to average earnings in the City and county, and this trend
has grown more noticeable as land and housing values have increased in
recent years. Maintaining and ensuring a balanced mix of housing types and
sizes that are affordable to a range of incomes is essential to ensuring the
long-term health of the community. Such balanced housing stock enables a
variety of residents to live and work in the City, maintain family ties, and
participate in community services, such as emergency services. Balanced
housing is also essential to attracting and maintaining an adequate
workforce, a healthy business environment, and a balanced tax base that
supports local services and the quality of life. The primary purpose of
this article is to allow the City to maintain an appropriate mix of housing
choices by creating a required number of quality new or rehabilitated
below-market-rate (BMR) units in future renovation and development. The
goal is not to offer a limited number of high-end units for a few qualified
households, but to provide as many quality affordable and workforce
housing units as possible, integrated throughout the City.
§ 223-41.9. Provision of BMR units.
To achieve the purposes above, the approval authority shall require that
10% of all projects containing 10 or more apartment dwellings and/or
attached dwellings (townhouses), as defined in § 223-63 of this chapter,
shall be comprised of below-market-rate units as defined and regulated
in this article. Any fraction at or above 0.5 shall be rounded up to the
nearest whole number, and any fraction below 0.5 shall be rounded down.
Subject to the Planning Board's approval, developer shall provide BMR
units mixed throughout the same building(s). Units designated as BMR units
must remain affordable for a minimum of 50 years from date of initial
certificate of occupancy for rental properties and from date of original sale
for owner-occupied units.
§ 223-41.10. Below-market-rate units.
A. Finishes, amenities, size, distribution and mix. BMR units shall have
exterior finishes comparable to the market-rate units within the
development. Interior finishes and amenities for the BMR units shall be
comparable to the market-rate units within the development, subject to
approval by the Planning Board. The timing of the construction of the
BMR units shall be in conjunction with the construction of the market
rate units in the project. Further, the BMR units shall be provided in a
mix of unit types in the same proportion as all other units in the
development unless a different proportion is approved by the Planning
§ 223-41.8 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.10
220:923
Board as being better related to the housing needs, current or
projected, of the City of Beacon.
B. Minimum gross floor area.
(1) The size of the BMR multifamily units may be smaller than the
market rate units, but notwithstanding other provisions of this

2 2 4
3 3 6
4 4 8
D. For townhouse developments containing BMR units, frontage, building
size and lot size may be reduced by up to 25% for the BMR units.
E. BMR unit eligible household. Households must meet the criteria
established in § 223-63 of this chapter, within the definition of "BMR
unit eligible household." Rental households shall be required to
requalify with respect to said criteria on an annual basis.
F. Maximum rent and sales price.
(1) Rental units: The monthly rent including utilities for BMR units
shall not exceed 30% of the figure that represents 70% of the

fixed rate mortgage, prevailing interest rates, and a down
payment of 5%.
(3) All projects approved by the Planning Board prior to the effective
date of this chapter may continue to set a monthly rent including
utilities for BMR units not to exceed 30% of 100% of the Dutchess
County area median annual income for the household size that will
occupy such unit as set forth in Subsection C income for its
household size [based on the United States Census and as updated
by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)].
(4) In the event the owner of the BMR unit governed by Subsection
F(1) above, demonstrates to the satisfaction of the City
Administrator or its designee that after a good faith effort it is not
able to rent a BMR unit pursuant to Subsection F(1), it may instead
comply with Subsection F(3) above, until the unit is next offered for

appropriate, for each BMR dwelling unit shall contain language,
§ 223-41.10 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.10
220:925
satisfactory to the City Attorney in form and substance, which states
that the subject dwelling is a below-market-rate unit as defined in
§ 223-63 of the Code of the City of Beacon, New York, and is subject to
all restrictions and limitations as set forth therein.
I. Resale. In the case of owner-occupied BMR units, the title to said
property shall be restricted so that in the event of any resale by the
homeowner or any successor, the resale price shall not exceed the
maximum sales price for said unit, as determined in Subsection F, plus
the depreciated value of capital improvements based on their estimated
life for up to 5% of the price of the unit. Units designated as BMR units
must remain affordable for a minimum of 50 years from date of original
sale for owner-occupied units.
J. Lease of a BMR unit.
(1) Individual BMR unit owners may lease their units to BMR eligible
unit households, as defined in § 223-63, for a period not exceeding
two years, with the consent of the City Administrator or its
designee.
(2) Applicants for rental BMR units, if eligible and if selected for
occupancy, may sign a lease for a term of no more than two years.
As long as a resident remains eligible and has complied with the
terms of the lease, said resident shall be offered renewal leases for
a term of no more than two years each. Renewal of a lease shall be
subject to the conditions of federal, state or county provisions that
may be imposed by the terms of the original development funding
agreements for the development or to the provisions of other
applicable local law.
(3) If a resident's annual gross income should subsequently exceed the
maximum income then allowable, said resident may complete their
current lease term and shall be offered a market-rate housing unit
in the development at the termination of such lease term. If no such
dwelling unit shall be available at said time, the resident may be
allowed to sign one additional one-year lease for BMR unit they
occupy but shall not be offered a renewal of the lease beyond that
expiration of said term. Tenants who again become eligible for a
BMR unit during the one-year term shall be eligible for a renewal of
their lease term.
K. Implementing regulations. The City Council may, by resolution, adopt
specific regulations to foster the efficient and equitable implementation
of this chapter.
L. Administration. The City Council shall be responsible for administering
these regulations and may designate a board, commission or other
organization to monitor compliance.
M. Developer incentives. For every one BMR unit provided as part of the
overall development, the developer shall have the right to 0.5 additional
§ 223-41.10 BEACON CODE § 223-41.10
220:926
market rate unit above the maximum number otherwise permitted
under applicable provisions of this chapter. Any fraction at or above
0.5 shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number, and any fraction
below 0.5 shall be rounded down. The Planning Board may grant up
to 10 additional units. District building height requirements must be
maintained, but the Planning Board may modify lot area per unit,
setbacks, building coverage, number of units per building, and parking
requirements to accommodate the bonus unit or units.
N. Waiver. Upon request of an applicant before the Planning Board, the
City Council may modify or waive specific provisions of this article, if it
finds that the proposal meets the primary purpose of § 223-41.8 and the
project will result in more BMR units than is required pursuant to this
chapter.

further project review and/or a further hearing, as it may deem
appropriate.
G. Site development plan review. After approval of the Fishkill Creek
development concept plan by the City Council, the Planning Board may
grant site plan approval to a Fishkill Creek development project.
(1) Application for site plan approval. The application for site
development plan approval shall contain all the material set forth in
§ 223-25B of this chapter. In addition, the applicant shall submit the
following:
(a) Information to establish that the proposed site plan complies
with § 223-41.13 I(15), Fishkill Creek vegetative buffer, of this
chapter.
(b) Information to establish that the proposed site plan meets the
Fishkill Creek development standards set forth in Subsection I
below.
§ 223-41.13 BEACON CODE § 223-41.13
220:934
(c) Information to establish that the proposed site plan is in
substantial conformance with the approved Fishkill Creek
development concept plan.
(d) Elevations showing the architectural and design treatment of
all buildings, public and open spaces and other site plan
elements.
(e) Information to establish the relationship of the proposed
project to later elements of the development of the FCD
District, including any other adjacent and nearby lands that
are not part of the applicant's Fishkill Creek development
project(s).
(f) Such other information as the Planning Board may reasonably
require in order to evaluate the site plan application.
(g) Application fees as required pursuant to Subsection E above.
(2) Planning Board review of site plan.
(a) The Planning Board shall conduct a detailed review of the
adequacy, location, arrangement, design and appearance of
each aspect of the proposed development. The Planning Board
shall have the authority to assure that aspects of the overall
development of the FCD District (e.g., stormwater
management, domestic water and fire protection, sanitary
sewer, all utilities, streets, etc.) shall be adequate to suit the
purposes and needs of the entire FCD District, as it is finally
developed.
(b) In acting on any site development plan application, the
Planning Board shall take into consideration the Fishkill Creek
development concept plan, the proposed design and layout of
the entire FCD District, including the proposed location, height
and landscaping of buildings, traffic circulation within and
without the site, provision of off-street parking, exterior
lighting, display of signs, landscaping, buffer areas and open
spaces, and architecture and design, so that any development
will have a harmonious relationship with the existing or
permitted development of contiguous land and of adjacent
neighborhoods, and so that pedestrian and vehicular traffic
will be handled adequately and safely within the site and in
relation to the adjoining street system. Particularly, the
Planning Board shall assure that the proposed site plan meets
the Fishkill Creek development design standards set forth in
Subsection I below.
(c) The proposed site development plan shall be in substantial
conformance with the Fishkill Creek development concept
plan. The site plan for a particular Fishkill Creek development
project will provide detailed building envelopes, elevations and
§ 223-41.13 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.13
220:935
site design details. The Planning Board may exercise its
discretion in allowing minor variations from the Fishkill Creek
development concept plan so long as the site plan is, in the
Planning Board's judgment, generally in keeping with the
Fishkill Creek development concept plan approved by the City
Council. In no case, however, shall the Planning Board have
the authority to approve a total number of dwelling units and/
or an amount of nonresidential floor area in the Fishkill Creek
development project which exceeds the number(s) approved as
part of the Fishkill Creek development concept plan.
(3) Time period for construction. At the time of approving the site plan,
the Planning Board may set forth the time period in which
construction is to begin and be completed. The Planning Board
may, in its discretion, extend any time period it has previously set
where it finds that changing market conditions or other
circumstances have acted to prevent the timely commencement or
completion of work, and that the developer has proceeded with
reasonable diligence in an effort to assure completion of the work
within the permitted time period. The extension of these time
periods shall not require the holding of a new public hearing.
(4) Adjustments to site plan during construction. During the
construction of an approved site plan, the Building Inspector or the
City Engineer may authorize minor adjustments to the approved
plans which are consistent with the overall approved site plan,
when such adjustments appear necessary in the light of technical
or engineering considerations which develop during actual
construction, or when such adjustments are required in order to
comply with law, rules or regulations made applicable to the
subject property by any agency or instrumentality of the United
States, New York State, Dutchess County or City government. The
Building Inspector or City Engineer may, in his discretion, refer any
such proposed change to the Planning Board for review. The
Planning Board may determine to treat the modification as a minor
site plan adjustment under this section or to treat it as a site plan
amendment under Subsection G(5) below. If treated as a minor site
plan adjustment, the Planning Board may authorize the Engineer or
Building Inspector to approve the requested change.
(5) Site plan amendments. If the Planning Board determines that the
character of the proposed changes requires a site plan amendment,
the Planning Board shall process the application as an amended
site plan under this Subsection G(5) and shall have the discretion to
determine the extent of further environmental analysis and project
review that is required. After appropriate review, the Planning
Board shall approve any site plan amendment by resolution.
H. Subdivision within a Fishkill Creek development. The Planning Board
may review any proposed subdivision application within a Fishkill
Creek development at any time. Any requests for subdivision approval
§ 223-41.13 BEACON CODE § 223-41.13
220:936
shall follow the procedures set forth in Chapter 195, Subdivision of
Land, of the City Code. The setbacks and other dimensional
requirements of the FCD District shall apply to the gross land area of
the total Fishkill Creek development project, whether or not the gross
land area is or will remain in one ownership, and shall not apply to
individual or subdivided lots.
I. Fishkill Creek development design standards.
(1) All new buildings or substantial alterations of existing buildings in
the Fishkill Creek Development District, shall comply with the
following design standards. These standards are intended to
supplement the provisions in Chapter 86, Architectural Design, and
to relate historic buildings and traditional streetscapes in the area
to new redevelopment efforts, while still allowing contemporary
architectural flexibility.
(2) Key terms. Standards using the verb "shall" are required; "should"
is used when the standard is to be applied unless the City Council
or Planning Board, as applicable, finds a strong justification for an
alternative solution in and unusual and specific circumstance; and
"may" means that the standard is an optional guideline that is
encouraged but not required.
(3) General district standards. While the FCD District may contain
various uses, development shall be planned as a cohesive unit, with
a comprehensive plan for access, connected greenspace,
landscaping, signs, circulation, and compatible architectural
elements. Plans should build on the existing Beacon environmental
and historic context.
(a) Proposals shall show previous buildings on the site and
document inspiration from the City's industrial past along the
riverfront and creek frontage, including the type and texture of
materials, roof forms, spacing and proportions of windows and
doors, and exterior architectural features. Building details may
be traditional or may be more modern and simple.
(b) Construction on parcels in or directly adjoining the Historic
District and Landmark Overlay Zone should reinforce
historical patterns and neighboring buildings with an emphasis
on continuity and historic compatibility, not contrast. The goal
is to renew and extend the traditional character of the district,
but new construction may still be distinguishable in up-to-date
technologies and details, most evident in windows and
interiors (see also Chapter 134, Historic Preservation).
(c) The plan shall be sensitive to the site's relationship to the
Fishkill Creek and developed in such a way as to maximize
important public views and view corridors throughout the
development.
§ 223-41.13 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.13
220:937
(4) Specific standards. See also the annotated photo examples in
Figures 13-1 through 13-3, illustrating the design standards.175
(a) Historic mill buildings in Beacon generally had simple forms
and repetitive window openings with flat or low-pitched gable
roofs. Groups of related buildings shall be designed to present
a varied but compatible mix. New construction should have
rooftop cornices, capstones, parapets, railings, or projecting
eaves.
(b) Architectural features, materials, and windows shall be
continued on all sides of the building, avoiding any blank walls.
Larger buildings should incorporate subtle breaks in the
facade and window surrounds with projecting sills, lintels, or
crowns to add some depth, shadow, and detail.
(c) Buildings shall have an emphasized entrance doorway to
visually connect the building to the street frontage and an
interconnected sidewalk and walking/bicycle path system to
allow residents access to the street and Greenway Trail along
the creek frontage.
(d) Industrial artifacts, such as stacks, towers, skylights, window
frames, loading doors, and docks, should be retained or
reproduced and incorporated into the design, whenever
possible. Railings, balconies, entrance canopies, lighting
fixtures, and other functional details should use industrial
styles, metal materials, and darker colors.
(e) Windows shall be divided into smaller panes to break up large
areas of glass. Individual panes shall be greater in height than
width, but the Planning Board may allow exceptions for
transom lights, storefronts, and other specialty windows.
Tinted or mirrored glass and large glass wall areas shall not be
permitted.
(f) Commercial buildings shall have at least 70% glass on the firstfloor
facades. Residential floors shall have at least a 30% glassto-
wall ratio.
(g) For finish building materials, traditional brick is recommended
with secondary elements of cement-based stucco, stone,

§ 223-10, Nonconforming uses and structures, except as may be otherwise
provided in this article. Any existing conforming building that is destroyed
by fire or casualty to an extent of more than 50% may be rebuilt on the
same footprint and with the same dimensions and may be extended at the
same height along its frontage. Any existing building that does not satisfy
the minimum building height requirements in the district may continue, but
any future expansion must conform to this chapter. In case of any conflict
between this article and other provisions of this zoning chapter, this article
shall control. In order to encourage mixed uses, more than one permitted
use shall be allowed on any lot or parcel, subject to all approval criteria
contained herein.

Figure 18-1: Central Main Street Zoning Requirements
Illustrative View
(1) Front setback: minimum zero, maximum 10 feet, except that a
larger maximum may be allowed if the area in front of a building
has no parking spaces and is landscaped and used in a manner that
enhances street life by such means as pocket parks or plazas,
fountains, outdoor dining, public art, and outdoor display of items
for sale on the premises. Such outdoor space shall be landscaped
with plant materials as appropriate to the use, in a configuration
approved by the Planning Board.
(2) Corner buildings: Corner buildings shall be treated as having
frontage on both streets and front yard setbacks shall apply to
both, as appropriate to the street.
(3) Side setbacks: minimum of zero. The minimum side setback may be
increased by the Planning Board to allow light and air to continue
to penetrate an existing building that has side windows or to allow
future development of an abutting parcel to the permitted building
height.
(4) Rear setbacks: minimum 25 feet for parcels 100 feet deep or more
and minimum 10 feet for parcels under 100 feet deep, except that if
the rear yard is voluntarily dedicated to the City of Beacon as all or
part of a public parking lot or parking structure, the minimum
setback shall be 10 feet with landscaping to screen adjacent uses.
(5) Minimum frontage occupancy on Main Street or East Main Street:
100% for buildings with a shared side wall and 80% for detached
buildings. Frontage occupancy is the percentage of the lot width
which must be occupied by either a front building facade or
structures that screen parking, located within the area between the
§ 223-41.18 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.18
220:949
minimum and maximum front setback. The purpose of this
requirement is to maintain a sense of enclosure of the street. This
requirement may be reduced by the Planning Board: a) to the
extent necessary to allow light and air into an adjacent building
that has side windows; b) allow future development of an abutting
parcel to the permitted building height; or c) if the applicant
provides a suitably surfaced and lighted pedestrian passageway
between the street and parking areas, public open spaces, or other
streets, located behind the building.
Figure 18-2: Frontage Occupancy
(6) Building height: minimum two stories, maximum three stories and
38 feet, as determined from the average street front level. Stories
built below the grade of the street shall not be counted toward
building height. The second story of a two-story building shall be
built in a manner that allows actual occupancy for one or more
permitted uses and does not create the mere appearance of a
second story. Chimneys, vent pipes, mechanical systems, elevator
shafts, antennas, wireless communications facilities, roof gardens,
fences, greenhouses, solar collectors, wind energy systems, and
other rooftop accessory structures may project up to 15 feet above
the maximum permitted height. With the exception of roof gardens
and solar collectors, such projections may occupy no more than
20% of the roof area and must be set back at least 15 feet from the
edge of the roof along any street frontage.
(7) Except for parcels facing East Main Street, a special permit may be
granted by the Planning Board for a fourth story with a stepback of
at least 15 feet behind the facade along any street frontage. A
fifteen-foot building stepback above 38 feet shall also be required
§ 223-41.18 BEACON CODE § 223-41.18
220:950
for any side of a four-story building within 40 feet of a lot line
abutting another zoning district. Except for parcels facing East
Main Street, a special permit may also be granted for a four-story
tower without a stepback at a corner facing an intersection and
occupying no more than 25 feet of the corner frontage of the
building.
(a) For proposed buildings on CMS parcels in or abutting the
Historic District and Landmark Overlay Zone, any fourth story
shall require a special permit by the City Council. The City
Council may reduce a permitted building height to be no more
than six feet higher than an existing building on an adjoining
HDLO parcel for a distance of 30 feet along the frontage from
the historic structure.
(b) All such special permits in the CMS District shall require a
finding that there are no substantial detrimental effects on
shadows, parking, traffic, or specific views adopted as
important by the City Council or in the Comprehensive Plan
Update, that the new building will be compatible with the
historic character of adjacent buildings, and that the
conditions and standards in § 223-18B(1)(a) through (d) have
been met. Although not required, additional below-market-rate
housing above what would be otherwise mandated in Article
IVB, commercial uses included on an upper floor, or extra
sidewalk width, plaza space, or green space that is accessible
to the public may be a positive factor for consideration during
the special permit review process.
(8) Building depth: Corner buildings shall not extend along a side
street more than 150 feet from the Main Street or East Main Street
frontage, unless the rear building height is reduced to two stories.
(9) Lot area and lot width: There are no minimum lot area or lot width
requirements.
(10) Lot depth: Minimum lot depth is 75 feet, except that on any lot in
which the area behind a building is voluntarily dedicated to the City
and accepted by the City Council for public parking, there shall be
no minimum depth requirement.
(11) Floor area ratio: There is no maximum floor area ratio.
(12) Landscaped area: A minimum of 10% of the lot shall be landscaped
with trees, shrubs, or grass in locations approved by the Planning
Board that enhance the streetscape, provide a landscaped rear
yard or courtyard, and are found to be consistent with the intent of
the CMS District. This requirement shall be reduced to 5% if the
landscaped area is accessible to the public. These requirements
may be waived for lots of 5,000 square feet or less.
(13) Dimensional standards.

F. Frontage types.
(1) For new buildings, only the following building frontage types are
permitted:
(a) Storefront.
(b) Forecourt.
(2) Storefront frontage type: a frontage type where the building facade
is placed at or close to the right-of-way line, with the entrance at
sidewalk grade. This building frontage type is conventional for
retail use. It is characterized by a high percentage of glazing on the
first floor, a prominent entrance, and often an awning. Recessed
doors are typically used to avoid doors opening into the sidewalk.

(b) Office and nonretail commercial: two spaces per 1,000 square
feet of floor area.
(c) Retail commercial and personal services: two spaces per 1,000
square feet of floor area.
(d) Other uses: as determined to be appropriate by the Planning
Board in the course of site plan review, or in the case of a new
use where site plan review is not required under § 223-41.18A,
as determined by the Building Inspector in consultation with
the City Planner.
(3) The requirements in Subsection G(2) above may be modified by the
Planning Board, in its discretion, based upon information
submitted by the applicant or otherwise made available in the
public record, demonstrating one or more of the following:
(a) That the projected operational characteristics of the proposed
use require a different amount of parking.
(b) That adequate shared parking, contractually obligated for the
duration of the proposed use, is available within 500 feet of the
site and within the CMS or PB Districts.
(c) That the applicant has provided sufficient bicycle parking to
reduce anticipated vehicular travel demand.
(d) That there is sufficient public parking available within 800 feet
of the site and within the CMS or PB Districts to meet
foreseeable parking needs of the proposed use and
surrounding uses for the duration of the proposed use.
(e) That the applicant will voluntarily dedicate land for public
parking on site or will acquire land by purchase or long-term
lease (for the duration of the proposed use) within 800 feet of
§ 223-41.18 BEACON CODE § 223-41.18
220:954
the site and within the CMS or PB Districts and voluntarily
dedicate such land to the City for public parking.
(f) That a professional parking study of the proposed use and the
surrounding area demonstrates that a different amount of
parking would be appropriate for the use in its particular
location and/or that existing and/or proposed off-site parking is
sufficient.
(4) For lots of 8,000 square feet or less, where the provision of on-site
parking is infeasible, the Planning Board may waive all parking
requirements, provided that the total floor area of the building is no
greater than 5,000 square feet.
(5) Section 223-26B of this chapter shall apply in the CMS District.
H. Streetscape improvements.
(1) Within the building transition zone, the Planning Board may
require the lot owner to provide planters, trees, shrubs, or other
landscaping to enhance the appearance of the streetscape.
Ornamental fencing four feet or less in height may be provided to
separate privately owned space from public space. Chain link,
vinyl, and solid fencing shall be prohibited. For commercial uses,
display areas, and outdoor dining and seating areas may be
provided.
(2) A pedestrian clearway, at least eight feet wide, with unobstructed
space for pedestrian activity shall be provided along the sidewalk,
unless site conditions require a narrower clearway. Within the
street transition zone, if space permits, lot owners may place
benches, tables, and outdoor seating areas with the approval of the
Department of Public Works. The Planning Board shall require the
planting of street trees on average 30 feet to 40 feet apart as a
condition of site plan approval, whenever street and sidewalk
conditions permit.
(3) The Planning Board may require the placement of bicycle racks of
an approved design within the street transition and building
transition zones. The Planning Board may require any building
containing 5,000 square feet or more of floor area to provide one
bicycle rack or equivalent indoor bicycle parking space for every
2,000 square feet of floor area.
(4) The Planning Board may require that an applicant constructing a
building greater than 10,000 square feet in floor area pay for the
provision of related street improvements to improve pedestrian
and/or bicycle safety.

I. Site plan and special permit amendments. For any proposed change to
an approved site plan, the applicant shall meet with the Building
Inspector who shall make a determination as to whether or not the
proposed change is significant. If the Building Inspector determines
that the change is significant (e.g., a change in dimensions of more than
10% shall be presumed to be significant), the application shall be
referred to the Planning Board for an amendment to the site plan or
special permit, as appropriate. If the Building Inspector determines
that the change is not significant and otherwise complies with
applicable requirements, the Building Inspector is authorized to issue a
building permit without further review.
J. Design standards.
(1) Because of the design standards in this section, the architectural
review provisions of Chapter 86 shall not apply within the CMS
District. In addition to the preceding sections of this article, all new
buildings or substantial alterations of existing buildings shall
comply with the following design requirements. These design
standards are intended to promote the following purposes:
(a) Preserve and enhance the unique character and general public
welfare of the City of Beacon;
(b) Promote pedestrian access and activity, as well as a general
sense of area security;
(c) Restore and maintain the role of streets as civic and social
spaces, framed by active uses;
(d) Encourage economic development and a convenient mix of
uses and services; and
(e) Support a sense of design context that appropriately relates
historic buildings, general facade and window patterns, and
§ 223-41.18 BEACON CODE § 223-41.18
220:956
traditional streetscapes in the area to new redevelopment
efforts, while still allowing architectural flexibility.
(2) Key terms: Standards using the verb "shall" are required; "should"
is used when the standard is to be applied unless the Planning
Board finds a strong justification for an alternative solution in an
unusual and specific circumstance; and "may" means that the
"standard" is an optional guideline that is encouraged but not
required.
(3) Proposed new buildings should be compatible with nearby historicquality
buildings along Main Street. References to the existing
context should include scale, type and texture of materials, roof
and cornice forms, spacing and proportion of windows and doors,
signs, and street-front fixtures. Building exteriors in or directly
adjoining the Historic District and Landmark Overlay sections of
the CMS District shall reinforce historic patterns and neighboring
buildings with an emphasis on continuity and compatibility, not
contrast, but new construction may still be distinguishable in
architectural details, most evident in window construction and
interiors.
(4) Buildings should have a top-floor cornice feature and first-floor
architectural articulation, such as a storefront with a secondary
cornice or an architecturally emphasized entrance doorway, to
accent the central body of the building.
(5) Architectural features and windows shall be continued on all sides
of the building that are clearly visible from a street or public
parking area, avoiding any blank walls, except in cases of existing
walls or potential common property walls. Larger buildings shall
incorporate significant breaks in the facades and rooflines at
intervals of no more than 35 feet.
(6) Building elements that provide additional architectural interest,
such as bay windows, and cornices, but not including balconies or
porches, may encroach up to two feet above the sidewalk, if the
bottom of the encroaching building elements is at least 12 feet
above grade. [Amended 12-9-2019 by L.L. No. 12-2019]
(7) Metal, glass or canvas-type awnings and canopies or projecting
signs are encouraged and may encroach up to six feet over the
sidewalk above seven feet. Vinyl awnings are discouraged unless
the applicant can demonstrate to the Planning Board's satisfaction
that the finish and design of such awning are of high quality,
aesthetically pleasing and meet the intended standards of the
district.
(8) Buildings shall have a front entrance door facing the primary street
and connected to the sidewalk. Front entrance doors for
§ 223-41.18 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.18
220:957
commercial buildings and retail storefronts shall be active and
provide main access during business hours.
(9) Primary individual window proportions shall be greater in height
than in width, but the Planning Board may allow exceptions for
storefront, transom, and specialty windows. Mirrored, reflective, or
tinted glass, all-glass walls, and exterior roll-down security gates
shall not be permitted. Any shutters shall match the size of the
window opening and appear functional.
(10) Commercial buildings shall have at least 70% glass on the firstfloor
facades, located between two feet and 10 feet above the
sidewalk. Main Street or East Main Street buildings should have at
least 30% glass on the upper-floor facades.
(11) Finish building materials should be wood, brick, traditional
cement-based stucco, stone, smooth cast stone, smooth-finished
fiber-cement siding, or other materials deemed acceptable by the
approving body. Vinyl, aluminum or sheet metal siding or sheet
trim, exposed concrete blocks or concrete walls, plywood or other
similar prefabricated panels, unpainted or unstained lumber,
synthetic rough-cut stone, synthetic brick, synthetic stucco,
exterior insulation and finishing system (EIFS), direct-applied
finish system (DAFS), and chain link, barbed wire, plastic, or vinyl
fencing shall not be permitted.
(12) Materials and colors should complement historic buildings on the
block. Fluorescent, neon, metallic, or other intentionally garish
colors, as well as stripes, dots, or other incompatible patterns, shall
be prohibited.
(13) Lighting fixtures shall be a maximum of 15 feet in height, except
pole lights in rear parking lots shall be a maximum of 20 feet high.
Lighting shall be energy efficient, have full spectrum color quality,
and, except for short-term event lighting, shall prevent any lighting
above 500 lumens that directly projects above the horizontal level
into the night sky with full cut-off fixtures.
(14) Mechanical equipment and refuse containers shall be concealed
from public view by approved architectural or landscaping
elements and shall be located to the rear of the site. Window or
projecting air conditioners shall not be permitted on the front
facade of new buildings or additions.
(15) The Planning Board may waive setback requirements for landmark
civic buildings, including government buildings, schools, libraries,
or places of worship, and for pedestrian-oriented places, such as
public greens or plazas and outdoor eating areas.

(4) Stoop. In this frontage type, the building facade is aligned close to
the frontage line. The first story is usually elevated sufficiently to
provide some privacy for occupants. A stoop (composed of an
elevated pad and stairs) lands at the edge of the sidewalk or a short
front walkway. A small porch or roof may cover the stoop. This
frontage type is suitable for ground-floor residential uses with
short setbacks.

(3) The quantity of required on-site parking in Subsection F(2) above
may be modified by the Planning Board, in its discretion, based
upon information submitted by the applicant or otherwise made
available to the Planning Board in the public record, demonstrating
one or more of the following:
(a) That the projected operational characteristics of the proposed
use and/or its proximity within walking distance of the train
station and other services justify a reduction in the required
amount of parking.
(b) That adequate shared parking, contractually obligated for the
duration of the proposed use, is available within 500 feet of the
site and in the L District.
(c) That the applicant has provided sufficient bicycle parking to

of the site and in the L District to meet foreseeable parking
needs of the proposed use and surrounding uses for the
duration of the proposed use.
(e) That the applicant will voluntarily dedicate land for public
parking on site or will acquire land by purchase or long-term
lease (for the duration of the proposed use) within 800 feet of
the site and in the L District and voluntarily dedicate such land
to the City for public parking.
(f) That a professional parking study of the proposed use and the
surrounding area demonstrates that a different amount of
parking would be appropriate for the use in its particular
location and/or that existing and/or proposed off-site parking is
sufficient.

220:972
(4) For small preexisting lots where the provision of on-site parking is
infeasible, the Planning Board may waive up to 50% of the parking
requirements, provided that the total floor area of the building is no
greater than 3,000 square feet. The Planning Board may grant
additional parking waivers, at its discretion, subject to an in-lieu
payment of $10,000 per parking space. [Amended 4-3-2017 by
L.L. No. 5-2017]
(5) Section 223-26B of this chapter shall not apply in the L District.
G. Streetscape improvements.
(1) On West Main Street, Beekman Street, and Wolcott Avenue, within
the building transition zone, the Planning Board may require the lot
owner to provide planters, trees, shrubs, or other landscaping to
enhance the appearance of the streetscape. Ornamental fencing
four feet or less in height may be provided to separate privately
owned space from public space. Chain link, vinyl, and solid fencing
shall be prohibited. For commercial uses, display areas, and
outdoor dining and seating areas may be provided.
(2) A pedestrian clearway, at least five feet wide, with unobstructed
space for pedestrian activity, shall be provided along the sidewalk,
unless site conditions require a narrower clearway. A pedestrian
clearway of eight feet shall be provided along storefront frontages.

plant trees and place benches, tables, and outdoor seating areas
with the approval of the Department of Public Works. The Planning
Board may require the planting of street trees on average 30 feet to
40 feet apart as a condition of site plan approval. To the extent
practical, an applicant shall, in cooperation with the City of Beacon
Department of Public Works, implement the recommendations in
the Linkage Plan street sections for Beekman Street and Wolcott
Avenue.

H. Site plan review/special permit procedures and criteria.
(1) In order to ensure an expedited review of site plans, this article
contains a streamlined site plan review procedure for any proposed
building or group buildings with 10,000 square feet or less in
footprint area, as follows:
(a) The applicant shall meet with the Building Inspector, who shall
provide a site plan application and instruction sheet describing
the requirements for site plan approval and who may
recommend that the applicant have a preapplication meeting
with the Planning Board to determine application submission
requirements.
(b) The applicant shall prepare a site plan with sufficient
information for the Planning Board to determine whether or
not it complies with the provisions of this article and is
consistent with the general intent of the Linkage Plan.
(c) If no special permit is required, the applicant shall then meet
with the Planning Board to discuss the proposal. No public
hearing will be required, unless the Planning Board determines
that the proposal may have substantial detrimental effects or
may cause public controversy.
(d) Within 45 days after such meeting, or if there is a public
hearing, within 45 days after the closing of the public hearing,
the Planning Board shall issue an approval, approval with
modifications, or denial of the application, stating the reasons
for any modifications or denial. The Planning Board shall also
issue a required schedule for initiation and completion of the
project. Such approval shall lapse within two years if the
applicant does not diligently pursue construction of the
project, unless the applicant requests an extension, which may
only be granted for good cause by the Planning Board.
§ 223-41.21 BEACON CODE § 223-41.21
220:974
(2) For projects with over 20,000 square feet in building footprint area,
or projects that require a special permit, the applicant shall follow
the procedures in §§ 223-18 and 223-25, except that the Planning
Board shall take the place of the City Council in § 223-18. Such
applications shall comply with those sections to the extent that
such sections do not contain standards that conflict with this
article. In case of a conflict, this article shall control. [Amended
7-21-2014 by L.L. No. 11-2014; 4-3-2017 by L.L. No. 5-2017]
(3) The Planning Board may require a performance guarantee for the
construction of public improvements in connection with any project
of 10,000 square feet or more in floor area.
(4) After completion of construction for a new building, the applicant
shall submit as-built plans to the Building Inspector showing the
exact location of all site alterations and construction.
I. Site plan and special permit amendments. For any proposed change to
an approved site plan, the applicant shall meet with the Building
Inspector who shall make a determination as to whether or not the
proposed change is significant. If the Building Inspector determines
that the change is significant (e.g., a change of use and/or a change in
dimensions of more than 10% shall be presumed to be significant), the
application shall be referred to the Planning Board for an amendment
to the site plan or special permit, as appropriate. If the Building
Inspector determines that the change is not significant and otherwise
complies with applicable requirements, the Building Inspector is
authorized to issue a building permit without further review.
J. Compliance with below market rate housing requirements. All
applications involving residential development shall comply with Article
IVB of this chapter (Affordable-Workforce Housing).
K. Design standards.
(1) Because of the design standards in this section, the architectural
review provisions of Chapter 86 shall not apply within the L
District. In addition to the preceding sections of this article, all new

when the standard is to be applied unless the Planning Board finds
a strong justification for an alternative solution in an unusual and
specific circumstance; and "may" means that the "standard" is an
optional guideline that is encouraged but not required.

sides of the building that are clearly visible from a street or public
parking area, avoiding any blank walls, except in cases of existing
walls or potential common property walls. Larger buildings shall
incorporate significant breaks in the facades and rooflines at
intervals of no more than 35 feet.
(5) Building elements that provide additional architectural interest,
such as bay windows, and cornices, but not including balconies or
porches, may encroach up to two feet beyond the front line if the
bottom of the encroaching building elements is at least 12 feet

provide main access during business hours.
(8) Primary individual window proportions shall be greater in height
than in width. Mirrored, reflective, or tinted glass, all-glass walls,
and exterior roll-down security gates shall not be permitted. Any
shutters shall match the size of the window opening, appear
functional, and be attached to the window frame.

Senior Affordable Housing Overlay (SAHO) District
[Added 11-19-2012 by L.L. No. 23-2012180]
§ 223-41.22. Specific requirements and regulations.
A. Intent and purpose. The Senior Affordable Housing Overlay District is
established to create affordable housing opportunities for seniors in the
City of Beacon and to provide for the adaptive reuse of older buildings
in the City. It is the intent and purpose of this article to establish a
framework for the development of affordable housing units for seniors,
to ensure that such development provides a minimum of services and
facilities to accommodate resident needs, to encourage the adaptive
reuse of older buildings in the City, and to minimize detrimental effects
on surrounding properties.
B. General provisions.
(1) A Senior Affordable Housing Overlay District designation is created
by legislative action of the City Council in the form of a zoning
amendment including the amendment of the City's Zoning Map.181
Properties eligible for such a designation are those within the City's
residential zoning districts as well as in the Waterfront
Development (WD) and Fishkill Creek Development (FCD)
Districts. A senior affordable housing project must involve the
adaptive reuse of an existing building which is at least 50 years old
and must additionally meet the general requirements and design
criteria set forth herein.
(2) A Senior Affordable Housing Overlay District designation by the
City Council adds a "senior affordable housing project" as an
additional use on the property, subject to all of the requirements
herein. Such use is in addition to, and does not replace the other
uses permitted by, the subject property's underlying zoning district.
(3) In a Senior Affordable Housing Overlay District, no building,
structure, premises or part thereof shall be used or occupied as a
senior affordable housing project, and no building or structure
shall be erected, enlarged, converted or altered for such purpose,
except as provided in this article, and as specifically provided in the
terms of the special permit and site plan approvals issued for such
use.
C. Permitted uses. In addition to the uses permitted in the subject
property's underlying zoning district, the following uses are also
permitted within a Senior Affordable Housing Overlay District:
180. Editor's Note: This local law was originally designated as Article IVD but was renumbered
to Article IVF to preserve the organization of the zoning chapter.
181. Editor's Note: The Zoning Map and all amendments thereto are on file in the City offices.
§ 223-41.22 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-41.22
220:983

to special permit approval by the City Council and site plan
approval from the Planning Board:
(a) Senior affordable housing project, consisting of affordable
studio/efficiency, one-bedroom and two-bedroom dwelling
units for the occupancy of senior households. Notwithstanding
the sentence immediately above, one dwelling unit may be
occupied by a project superintendent or manager and his/her
family.
(2) Accessory uses. The following accessory uses are permitted in a
senior affordable housing project:
(a) Buildings and facilities which are reasonably necessary to
meet the proper maintenance, administration, security, offstreet

This would equate to a building having at least approximately 8,000
square feet of floor area.]
(2) Building modifications. The senior affordable housing project shall
consist primarily of the adaptive reuse of an existing building
whose primary portion is over 50 years old. The City Council, either
in its zoning designation or in its special permit, may authorize
modifications to the existing building to enhance its adaptive reuse
for senior affordable housing including, for example, modification
of the roofline to better accommodate residential units, provided
§ 223-41.22 BEACON CODE § 223-41.22
220:984

increased by more than eight feet, and modification of the line
of outer walls to accommodate better layout and light and air for
dwelling units, or for the inclusion of additional common spaces.
Authorized additions to the building(s) shall not exceed 10% of
the gross floor area of the building(s). Exterior alterations shall
comply with any applicable requirements for a certificate of
appropriateness under Chapter 134 of the Code. In no event shall
a senior affordable housing project include any new freestanding
buildings housing residential units. The City Council may authorize
the construction of outbuildings for accessory functions, such as
garages, an exterior generator, maintenance shed(s), and the like.
(3) Lot and bulk requirements. Except for building modifications
authorized by the City Council in its zoning designation or special
permit, the building, including any additions or modifications, shall
meet the lot and bulk requirements in the underlying zoning
district in which the property is located, except for existing
noncomplying situations.
E. Supplementary site regulations.
(1) Parking ratio. Unless modified by the City Council in its zoning
designation or special permit, parking spaces shall be provided at
the ratio of 1.2 spaces per dwelling unit. The 0.2 fractional space

not in substantial conformance would require an amended overlay
district designation.

power to grant use variances.
(b) No such use variance shall be granted by a Board of Appeals
without a showing by the applicant that applicable zoning
regulations and restrictions have caused unnecessary
hardship. In order to prove such unnecessary hardship the
applicant shall demonstrate to the board of appeals that for
each and every permitted use under the zoning regulations for
the particular district where the property is located:
[1] The applicant cannot realize a reasonable return, provided
that lack of return is substantial as demonstrated by
competent financial evidence;
[2] The alleged hardship relating to the property in question is
unique, and does not apply to a substantial portion of the
district or neighborhood;
[3] The requested use variance, if granted, will not alter the
essential character of the neighborhood; and
[4] The alleged hardship has not been self-created.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in granting of use variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate to address the unnecessary hardship proven by the
applicant, and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and
welfare of the community.

(a) The Board of Appeals shall have the power, upon an appeal
from a decision or determination of the administrative official
charged with the enforcement of such ordinance or local law,
to grant area variances.
(b) In making a determination, the Board of Appeals shall take into
consideration the benefit to the applicant if the variance is
granted, as weighed against the detriment to the health, safety
and welfare of the neighborhood or community by such grant.
In making such a determination the board shall also consider:
[1] Whether an undesirable change will be produced in the
character of the neighborhood or a detriment to nearby
properties will be created by granting the area variance;
[2] Whether the benefit sought by the applicant can be
achieved by some method feasible for the applicant to
pursue, other than an area variance;

Notice of hearing shall be provided by the applicant in accordance with
§ 223-61.3 of this chapter.
[3] Whether the requested area variance is substantial;
[4] Whether the proposed variance will have an adverse effect
or impact on the physical or environmental conditions in
the neighborhood or district; and
[5] Whether the alleged difficulty was self-created, which
consideration shall be relevant to the decision of the Board
of Appeals, but shall not necessarily preclude the granting
of the area variance.
(c) The Board of Appeals, in granting of area variances, shall grant
the minimum variance that it shall deem necessary and
adequate and at the same time preserve and protect the
character of the neighborhood and the health, safety and

Scenic Roads
[Added 10-7-1996 by L.L. No. 11-1996]
§ 223-70. Objectives.
The objectives of the Scenic Road Local Law are for the common good and
to:
§ 223-71. Authority.
Pursuant to the authority granted by Municipal Home Rule Law, Article 2,
§ 10 of the Consolidated Laws of New York and consistent with the goals
of the 1974 Development Plan, as amended, the City of Beacon hereby
A. Preserve and protect the present quality and character of certain
specific roads of the City of Beacon (the "City");
B. Recognize the contribution the City's road system has made and will
make to the scenic character, uniqueness and quality of life in the City;
C. Recognize that the City's road system is an integral part of the diverse
environments of the City and what affects the roads also affects the
ecology contiguous to the road;
D. Recognize that there are specific unique features which contribute to
the beauty and enjoyment of the City's road system;
E. Recognize the important role of the City of Beacon Highway
Department (the "Street Superintendent") in preserving this critical
City asset and to further strengthen that role by providing an avenue of
access and communication for the City of Beacon Street
Superintendent (the "City Highway Department"), with the City of
Beacon City Council (the "City Council"), the City of Beacon Planning
Board (the "Planning Board") and the City of Beacon Conservation
Advisory Commission ("CAC"). The value of this access lies in the
following: Unlike the technical, safety and operational aspects of City
road management, matters pertaining to environmental and aesthetic
aspects (and the long-term effect on these) are oftentimes judgmental;
F. Recognize that City roads should continue to provide safe, confident
use to residents and transients and at the same time continue to offer
the wealth of aesthetic features already in place and there to be
enjoyed;
G. Recognize there are many fragile components that are connected with
the City roads and are presently taken for granted. This article
recognizes that fragility. Once eliminated or adversely altered, these
resources may be irreplaceable; and
H. This article recognizes that it is the intent of the City of Beacon that all
activities on or along City roads conform to relevant law.
§ 223-70 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-71

§ 223-81. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
BUILDING-INTEGRATED PHOTOVOLTAIC (BIPV) COLLECTORS  A solar
energy system that consists of integrating photovoltaic modules into the
building envelope, such as the roof or the facade, which does not alter the
roofline.
FLUSH-MOUNTED SOLAR PANEL  A photovoltaic panel or tile that is
installed flush to the surface of a roof and which cannot be angled or raised.
FREESTANDING OR GROUND-MOUNTED SOLAR ENERGY COLLECTOR
 A solar energy system that is directly installed in the ground and is
not attached or affixed to an existing structure. Pole-mounted solar energy
systems shall be considered freestanding or ground-mounted solar energy
systems for purposes of this chapter.
LARGE-SCALE SOLAR COLLECTION SYSTEM OR SOLAR FARM  An area
of land with solar facilities principally used to capture solar energy and
convert it to electrical energy to transfer to the public electric grid in order
to sell electricity to or receive a credit from a public utility entity, but also
may be for on-site use. Solar facilities consist of one or more freestanding
ground- or roof-mounted solar collector devices, solar-related equipment
and other accessory structures and buildings, including light reflectors,
concentrators, heat exchangers, substations, electrical infrastructure,
transmission lines and other appurtenant structures and facilities.
A. Solar energy is a renewable and nonpolluting energy resource that can
prevent fossil fuel emissions and reduce a municipality's energy load.
Energy generated from solar energy systems can be used to offset
energy demand on the grid where excess solar power is generated.
B. The use of solar energy equipment for the purpose of providing
electricity and energy for heating and/or cooling is a priority and is a
necessary component of the City of Beacon's current and long-term
sustainability agenda.
C. This article aims to promote the accommodation of solar energy
systems and equipment and the provision for adequate sunlight and
convenience of access necessary therefor and to balance the potential
impact on neighbors when solar collectors may be installed near their
property while preserving the rights of property owners to install solar
energy systems without excess regulation.
§ 223-80 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § 223-81
220:1037
PASSIVE SOLAR COLLECTOR  A solar energy system that relies upon
original or retrofitted design features and building materials of a structure
to enhance the use of natural forces to provide heating and cooling within a
building.
PHOTOVOLTAIC (PV) COLLECTOR  A solar energy system that produces
electricity by the use of semiconductor devices, called "photovoltaic cells,"
which generate electricity whenever light strikes them.
QUALIFIED SOLAR INSTALLER  A person who has skills and knowledge
related to the construction and operation of solar electrical equipment
and installations and has received safety training on the hazards involved.
Persons who are on the list of eligible photovoltaic installers maintained
by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority
(NYSERDA), or who are certified as a solar installer by the North American
Board of Certified Energy Practitioners (NABCEP), shall be deemed to
be qualified solar installers for the purposes of this definition. Persons
who are not on NYSERDA's list of eligible installers or NABCEP's list
of certified installers may be deemed to be qualified solar installers if
the Building Inspector or such other City officer or employee as the City
Council designates determines such persons have had adequate training to
determine the degree and extent of the hazard and the personal protective
equipment and job planning necessary to perform the installation safely.
Such training shall include the proper use of special precautionary
techniques and personal protective equipment, as well as the skills and
techniques necessary to distinguish exposed energized parts from other
parts of electrical equipment and to determine the nominal voltage of
exposed live parts.
ROOFTOP OR BUILDING-MOUNTED SOLAR COLLECTOR  A solar
system in which solar panels are mounted on top of the structure of a roof
either as a flush-mounted system or as a module fixed to frames which can
be tilted toward the south at an optimal angle.
SOLAR ACCESS  Space open to the sun and clear of overhangs or shade,
including the orientation of streets and lots to the sun so as to permit the
use of active and/or passive solar energy systems on individual properties.
SOLAR COLLECTOR  A device or combination of devices which relies
upon solar radiation as an energy source and that is employed for the
purposes of heating or cooling a building, the heating of water or the
generation of electricity. For the purposes of this chapter, a solar collector
does not include any solar energy system of four square feet in size or less.
SOLAR ENERGY EQUIPMENT  Solar collectors, controls, energy storage
devices, heat pumps, heat exchangers, batteries and other materials,
hardware or equipment necessary to the process by which solar radiation
is collected, converted into another form of energy, stored, protected from
unnecessary dissipation and distributed.

220:1041
§ 223-84. Safety.

Appendix
Chapter A226
POLO FIELDS ANNEXATION
GENERAL REFERENCES
Zoning  See Ch. 223.
§ A226-1. Petition; statutory requirements.
The petition190 of Polo Fields Investment Limited Partnership complies with
the requirements of Article 17 of the General Municipal Law and is found to
have been properly executed by qualified persons.
§ A226-2. Determination at public hearing.
The public hearing on this petition reveals no credible evidence that the
annexation is not in the overall public interest.
§ A226-3. Findings.
Both the City of Beacon and the Town of Fishkill find the annexation to
be in the overall public interest and in the interests of the City and the
town respectively, and of the owners of the lands that are the subject of the
annexation petition in that:
A. The annexation will facilitate the connection of Polo Fields to Beacon
water and sewer services, which utilities would not be available to the
Polo Fields absent the annexation.
B. The annexation will facilitate the construction of new water and sewer
improvements beyond the boundaries of the Polo Fields in the Dutchess
Junction area, which is an area presently in need of such improvement.
C. After the annexation of the Polo Fields property and the associated
annexation of the property owned by Eastone Associates nearby,
property tax revenues will remain substantially the same for the City
and the town, with the town experiencing a small loss of $6,322. This
loss will be offset by a $22,500 payment of recreation fees in the town.
Moreover, notwithstanding any loss of property tax revenue to the
town, the benefit to the public arising from the availability of sewer and
water to areas as a result of this action is significant and offsets the loss
of taxes estimated on record.
190. Editor's Note: Said petition is on file in the office of the City Clerk.
§ 223-86 BEACON CODE § A226-3
220:1044
§ A226-4. Water and sewer agreements.
Beacon and Fishkill shall execute agreements for the provision of water and
sewer to the entire Polo Fields Development. The findings contained herein
are subject to these agreements being fully approved and executed by the
City Council and the Town Board. This local law and the annexation are
contingent on the execution of these agreements.
§ A226-5. Adjustment of property taxes.
Property taxes due to the City and the town will be adjusted pro rata to
account for the change of taxable status after the taxable status date as that
term is defined in the Real Property Tax Law.
§ A226-6. Maintenance of Slocum Road.
The town will continue to maintain Slocum Road.
§ A226-7. Public hearing and referendum not required.
Pursuant to § 714 of the General Municipal Law, a public hearing is not
required prior to the enactment of this local law. A referendum is not
required, since there are no owner-residents in the area being annexed.
§ A226-8. When effective.
This local law will become effective upon the execution of the aforesaid
water and sewer agreements between the City and the town and the filing
of this local law with the Secretary of State.
D. The construction of the Polo Fields project will result in the
construction of a new firehouse for the Dutchess Junction Fire Company
at no cost to the taxpayer.
E. When the Polo Fields Development is occupied, residents of the
development will spend money in both the City of Beacon and the Town
of Fishkill, which will increase Dutchess County sales tax revenues and
is anticipated to increase the share of sales tax revenues to each
municipality.
F. It is anticipated that many of the residents of the Polo Fields project will
work outside Dutchess County, meaning the money spent by these
residents in Dutchess County will be earned elsewhere.
G. Annexation of part of Polo Fields into the City of Beacon will increase
property tax revenues to the City of Beacon, and will permit the
improvement of the area of Polo Fields that remains in Fishkill,
resulting in increased assessments overall.
§ A226-3 WATERFRONT CONSISTENCY REVIEW § A226-9
220:1045
§ A226-9. Zoning designation.
The zoning designation of this annexed area shall be set forth in a separate

The annexation described in the petition (Exhibit A) is approved; and it is
ordered that the consent and approval of the City Council of the City of
Beacon is hereby granted to the annexation of the area described in the
petition (Exhibit A).
