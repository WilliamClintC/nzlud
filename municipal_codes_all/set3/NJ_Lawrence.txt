and testimony as well as other preparations, shall be provided in every
case. The Township shall be responsible for payment for services
pursuant to this section. The factors of need and real value to a
defendant may be weighed against the financial constraints of the
Township in determining the necessary services and facilities of
representation. The final determination as to necessity for services
required shall be made by the Court.
C. The Municipal Public Defender shall be responsible for handling all
phases of the defense, including, but not limited to, discovery, pre-trial
and post-trial hearings, motions, removals to Federal District Court and
other collateral reasonably related to the defense.
D. The Municipal Public Defender shall represent an indigent defendant
charged in Municipal Court with a crime as specified in N.J.S.A.
2B:12-18 or, if in the opinion of the Municipal Court, there is a
likelihood that the defendant, if convicted of any other offense will be
subject to imprisonment or other consequence of magnitude, the
Municipal Public Defender shall represent an indigent defendant.
E. If there is a vacancy in the office of Municipal Public Defender, if the
Municipal Public Defender is temporarily unavailable or if a finding of
conflict of interest precludes the Municipal Public Defender from
representing an indigent defendant, the Municipal Prosecutor may
prosecute the offense if the Municipal Court appoints a qualified
attorney to represent the indigent defendant.
F. Unless rates are otherwise established by the Township, the Attorney
shall be entitled to compensation at the same rate as attorneys hired by
the Office of the Public Defender in conflict cases, with payment to be
made within 30 days. Once appointed, the Attorney shall carry out all
§ 10-46 LAWRENCE CODE § 10-47
1:54
duties of the Municipal Public Defender in connection with the case that
is the subject of the appointment.
G. Eligibility for services of the Municipal Public Defender shall be
determined by the Municipal Court on the basis of the need of the
defendant. Need shall be measured according to N.J.S.A. 2A:158A-14
and guidelines promulgated by the New Jersey Supreme Court.
H. In the event that a determination of eligibility cannot be made before
the time when the first services are to be rendered, or if an initial
determination is found to be erroneous, the Municipal Court shall refer
the defendant to the Municipal Public Defender provisionally, and if
subsequently it is determined that the defendant is ineligible, the
Municipal Court shall inform the defendant, and the defendant shall be
obliged to engage his own counsel and to reimburse for the cost of the
services rendered to that time.
I. The Municipal Court shall make an investigation of the financial status
of each defendant seeking representation pursuant to this subsection
and shall have the authority to require a defendant to execute and
deliver written requests or authorizations required under applicable
law to provide the Court with access to records of public or private
sources otherwise confidential, as may be of aid in evaluating eligibility.
The Court is authorized to obtain information from any public record
office of the state or of any subdivision or agency thereof on request and
without payment of the fees ordinarily required by law.
J. Whenever a person entitled to representation by a Municipal Public
Defender pursuant to this subsection is under the age of 18 years, the
eligibility for services shall be determined on the basis of financial
circumstance of the individual and the financial circumstances of the
individual's parents or legal guardians. The Township shall be entitled
to recover the cost of legal services from the parent or legal guardians
as provided in this section in § 16 of the Act and the Municipal Court
shall have authority to require parents or legal guardians to execute
and deliver the written requests or authorization required under
applicable law in order to provide the Court with access to records of
public or private sources, otherwise confidential, as may be of aid to it
in evaluating eligibility.
K. If the defendant has or reasonably expects to have means to meet some
part, though not all, of the cost of the services rendered, the defendant
shall be required to reimburse the Township, either by a single payment
or in installments in such amounts as he can reasonably be expected to
pay; but no default or failure in making payments shall affect or reduce
the rendering of services.
L. The Township shall have a lien on any property to which the defendant
shall have or acquire an interest for an amount equal to the reasonable
value of the services rendered to a defendant pursuant to this act as
§ 10-47 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 10-47
1:55
calculated at the same rate as the Office of the Public Defender bills
clients at that time.
M. To effectuate such a lien for the Township, the Township Attorney shall
file a notice setting other services rendered to the defendant and the
reasonable value thereof with the Clerk of the Superior Court. The filing
of the notice with the Clerk of the Superior Court shall constitute a lien
on property for a period of 10 years from the date of filing, unless
discharged sooner, and, except for such time limitations, shall have the
force and effect of a judgment. Within 10 days of the filing of the notice,
the Municipal Attorney shall sent by certified mail, or serve personally,
a copy of the notice with a statement of the date of the filing to or upon
the defendant at the defendant's last known address. If the Municipal
Attorney shall fail to give notice the lien is void.
N. The Township shall require by ordinance a person applying for
representation by a Municipal Public Defender or Court-approved
Counsel to pay an application fee of not more than $200, but only in an
amount necessary to pay the costs of Municipal Public Defender
services. In accordance with guidelines promulgated by the Supreme
Court, the Municipal Court may waive any required application fee, in
whole or in part, only if the Court determines, in its discretion, upon a
clean and convincing showing by the applicant that the application fee
represents an unreasonable burden on the person seeking
representation. The Municipal Court may permit a person to pay the
application fee over a specific period of time not to exceed four months.

(1) Purpose. For the convenience of those persons and entities which
utilize the services of off-duty police officers and to authorize the
special duty employment of Township police while off-duty, the
Township hereby establishes a policy regarding the use of said
officers.
(a) Sworn officers of the Police Division shall be permitted to
accept police related employment for private employers only
during off-duty hours and at such times as will not interfere
with the efficient performance of regularly scheduled or
emergency duty for the Township.
(b) Any person or entity wishing to employ a special duty police
officer shall first obtain the approval of the Chief of Police (or
designee), which approval shall be granted if, in the opinion of
the Chief, such employment would not be inconsistent with the
efficient functioning and good reputation of the Police Division
§ 20-10 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 20-10
1:93
and would not unreasonably endanger or threaten the safety of
the employee or employees who are to perform the work.
(2) Escrow accounts.
(a) Any person or entity requesting the services of a special duty
police officer shall estimate the number of hours such services
are required, which estimate shall be approved by the Chief of
Police, and shall establish an escrow account with the Chief
Financial Officer of the Township by depositing an amount
sufficient to cover the rates of compensation and
administrative fees set forth in Subsection I(8) for the total
estimated hours of service.
(b) Prior to posting any request for services of special duty police
officers, the Chief of Police or his designee, shall verify that the
balance in the escrow account of the person or entity
requesting services is sufficient to cover the compensation and
fees for the number of hours specified in the request for
services. The Chief of Police shall not post nor offer a request
for services from any person or entity unless all fees and
compensation required in the manner described above have
been deposited with the Chief Financial Officer. No officer shall
provide any services for more hours than are specified in the
request for services.
(c) In the event the funds in said escrow account become depleted,
services of off-duty employees shall cease and requests for
further or future services shall not be performed or posted
until additional funds have been deposited in the escrow
account in the manner prescribed above.
(d) The person or entity requesting such services shall be
responsible for ensuring that sufficient funds remain in the
escrow account in order to avoid any interruption of services.
(e) Failure to pay. In the event the person or entity contracting for
such services should fail to pay any balance due for services
performed by the members of the Lawrence Township Police
Department, such failure shall be deemed a violation of this
section and subject the person or entity to the violations and
penalties set forth below.
(f) Exemption. All public utility companies that are under the
jurisdiction of and regulated by the New Jersey Board of Public
Utilities are exempt from the provisions set forth in this section
requiring advance payment to the escrow account; provided,
however, that there are no amounts previously due that are
outstanding prior to any officer engaging in any further special
duty assignments.
§ 20-10 LAWRENCE CODE § 20-10
1:94
(g) The Township may choose to utilize a secondary service to
administrate and perform the above actions related to the
special duty employment process. These actions include, but
are not limited to: communicating with said person or company
to schedule extra duty assignments, scheduling the officers for
the said assignments, invoicing person or entity and receiving
escrow and or payments from person or entity in a manner set
forth by the secondary service provider. The secondary service
provider may charge an additional fee for services that is
above and in addition to the fee structure stated above and
utilize business type collection rules as set forth in the
contract/agreement between the Township and the secondary
service provider.
(h) The secondary service provider will reimburse the Township
via ACH or other funds transfer methods, according to the fees
set forth in this section, due to the Township and Officer, in a
timely manner, usually coinciding with payroll periods for the
special duty assignment that the officers have performed or
were scheduled for in that period, in accordance with the
above listed rules of employment between the Township and
person(s) or entity seeking services.
(3) Requests for service. All requests to the Township for the services
of special duty police officers shall be forwarded to the Chief of
Police or the secondary service provider for posting at least 10 days
prior to the date that such services are required. Any employee
assigned and working pursuant to this regulation shall be treated
as an on-duty employee of the Township with the exception that
wages earned for outside employment shall not be applied toward
pension benefits, shall not be considered overtime and shall be paid
at a rate of pay as described in Subsection I(8).
(a) The Chief of Police will be responsible for scheduling
employees who will be assigned to special duty work as
described herein.
(b) The Chief of Police may establish a limit on assignments per
officer to ensure that special duty work does not impair an
officer's ability to perform during regularly scheduled tours of
duty.
(c) The Chief of Police shall determine if a Township vehicle is
required for the special duty assignment and shall assign a
vehicle in such cases as he deems necessary. A vehicle fee will
be charged to the person or entity for the use of such
vehicle(s). The vehicle fee will be charged at a rate as
described in Subsection I(8). No administrative fee will be
added to the hourly vehicle rate.

officers from the Lawrence Township Police Department. If the
Chief of Police determines that the demand cannot be met by
the Lawrence Township Police Department, he may request
additional law enforcement officers from outside agencies.
(4) Special duty assignments voluntary.
(a) The work to be performed shall be considered a special duty
assignment from independent contractors and will not be
considered a direct assignment. The taking of any special duty
assignments shall be on a voluntary basis in accordance with a
fair and reasonable system established and administered by
the Chief of Police. Any employee of the Township assigned and
working pursuant to this regulation shall be treated as an onduty
employee of the Township with the exception that wages
earned for outside employment shall not be applied toward
pension benefits, shall not be considered overtime and shall be
paid at a rate of pay as described in Subsection I(8).
(b) The Township reserves the right to assign an on-duty employee
to fill a special duty assignment that cannot be filled in such
cases where the Chief of Police deems such action to be in the
best interest of the Township. In such cases, the Township shall
first have posted such assignment without attaining a qualified
employee. Should an employee be assigned on-duty, the
employee shall receive his/her regular rate of compensation for
the assignment. The Township shall retain the right to bill for
such an assignment.
(5) Cancellation of assignment. Any assignment which is canceled on
less than four hours' notice shall be charged against the party and
paid to the employee so assigned. Any other canceled assignment
shall not be billable to the party nor payable to the employee.
(6) Chief's order to vacate assignment. The Chief of Police has the
authority to order any employee to vacate or terminate any special
duty assignment in response to emergency situations or whenever
the assignment creates an unacceptable risk to health, safety and/
or welfare of the employee and/or the public in the sole
determination and discretion of the Chief of Police. The contractor
shall not be responsible for any compensation for the time that the
employee is away from the special duty assignment and shall have
no claim for costs or damages against the Township, the Chief or
the employee arising from the termination of special duty
assignment other than the prorated return of any costs prepaid to
the Township.
(7) Township to provide insurance coverage. The Township shall be
responsible to provide all necessary insurance coverage, as
required by law, including, but not limited to, workers

1:96

injury including death or damage to property which may arise as
a result of the Township's performance under the contract. The
Township may, however, discipline or remove any employee from
eligibility for special duty assignments if, in the opinion of the Chief
of Police, his/her job performance or actions place the Township in
a position that may result in a claim for liability.

requirement of an escrow deposit as provided for in Subsection
I(2), Escrow accounts.

[Adopted by Ord. No. 1438-95]
§ 130-12. Findings.
§ 130-13. Definitions.
As used in this article, the following terms shall have the meanings
indicated:
SUBSTANTIAL NONCOMPLETION  Any building in which construction
has begun and which, for a period of six months or more, construction of
a substantial portion remains unfinished as to be potentially dangerous or
injurious to the health and safety of the residents of Lawrence Township
or is so unsightly to potentially lower the value of a neighbor's property or
home.
§ 130-14. Powers of the Construction Official.
The Construction Official is granted the power to investigate any building
and/or structure within the Township in order to determine if it is in a state
substantial noncompletion.
A. Municipalities have been granted the Police power to regulate for the
common good of their citizens, i.e., public health, safety and general
welfare; and they are empowered pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.3 to
repair, close or demolish buildings that are so old, dilapidated or have
been so out of repair as to be dangerous, unsafe, insanitary or
otherwise unfit for human habitation or occupancy or use of its citizens.
N.J.S.A. 40:48-1, Subdivision 15, allows a municipality to enact
ordinances for the removal of any building or structure which may
become dangerous to life or health with costs to be assessed to the
owner; and municipalities are empowered to pass ordinances which
preserve and protect property values affecting the general welfare of
the community per N.J.S.A. 40:48-2.
B. There exists in Lawrence Township buildings and/or structures that
remain in such a state of substantial incompletion that they pose a
significant danger in the form of potential injuries to trespassers,
especially children, as such buildings, and/or structures are attractive
nuisances to the young; and buildings and/or structures which remain
substantially incomplete are unsightly and may substantially reduce the
value of other properties in the area, thereby negatively impacting the
general welfare of the citizens of Lawrence Township.
A. The Construction Official may determine that a building and/or
structure is in a state of substantial non-completion if he/she finds that
the conditions of the building and/or structure are of such a state as to
be potentially dangerous or injurious to the health and safety of the
occupants of neighboring buildings or other residents of the Township;
§ 130-12 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 130-14
1:219
§ 130-15. Order requiring restoration of property or completion;
time limit.
If, after the hearing, the Construction Official determines that the building
and/or structure is in a state of substantial non-completion as to be
potentially dangerous or to lower the value of neighboring homes, he/she
shall issue and cause to be served upon the owner thereof and parties in
interest, an order requiring the owner to remove and restore the land to its
previous condition prior to commencement of construction or to commence
completion of construction of such building and/or structure within 60 days.
§ 130-16. Owner refuses to comply.
If the owner refuses to comply with the order to remove and restore the
land to its previous condition prior to commencement of construction or
to commence completion of the building and/or structure within 60 days,
the Construction Official may cause such building and/or structure to be
removed and restore the land to its previous conditions.
§ 130-17. Construction official to act; costs.
In the event that the Construction Official causes such building and/or
structure to be removed and the land restored to its previous condition, the
costs of such action shall be a municipal lien against the real property upon
which the costs were incurred. The Construction Official shall then sell the
materials of such building and/or structure and credit the proceeds of the
sale against the costs of removal or demolition, and any balance remaining
shall be deposited in the Superior Court by the Public Health Officer and
shall be disbursed by such court to the persons found to be entitled thereto
in the final order or judgment of such court.
or that the condition of the building and/or structure is so unsightly
as to potentially lower the value of neighboring homes or property.
Moreover, the building and/or structure must be in or have remained in
a similar state for a period of three months. The Construction Official
may rely, as needed, on the expertise of engineers or other such
professionals, in making such determination, as allowed by the
Lawrence Township budget.
B. Upon concluding that a substantially uncompleted building and/or
structure is potentially dangerous or injurious to the health and welfare
of the Township's occupants, the Construction Official shall serve,
either personally or by certified mail, a complaint on the owner of the
building and/or structure stating the charges, and containing a notice
that a hearing will be held before the Construction Official at a place
therein fixed not less than 10 days or more than 30 days from service of
the complaint.

periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and
safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
B. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
areas of special flood hazard which increase flood heights and
velocities, and when inadequately anchored, causes damage in other
areas. Uses that are inadequately floodproofed, elevated or otherwise
protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

B. Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C. Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding
and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;
D. Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future
flood blight areas;
G. Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of
special flood hazard; and
H. Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume
responsibility for their actions.

of this chapter, the Zoning Board of Adjustment may attach such
conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to
further the purposes of this chapter.
(6) The Zoning Officer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions,
including technical information, and report any variances to the
Federal Insurance Administration upon request.
B. Conditions for variances.
(1) Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and
substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of 1/2 acre or less
in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing
structures constructed below the base flood level, providing items
§ 185-13A(4)(a) through (k) have been fully considered. As the lot
size increases beyond the 1/2 acre, the technical justification
required for issuing the variance increases.
(2) Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of historic
structures upon a determination that the proposed repair or
rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum
necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the
structure. In the evaluation of the variance, the Zoning Officer may
consult with the Lawrence Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee or qualified professional as may be necessary.

increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would
result.
(4) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the
variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard,
to afford relief.
(5) Variances shall only be issued upon:
(a) A showing of good and sufficient cause;
(b) A determination that failure to grant the variance would result
in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and
(c) A determination that the granting of a variance will not result
in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety,
extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public as identified in § 185-14A(4), or
conflict with other existing local laws or ordinances.
(6) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written
notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest
floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of
flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation.
A. Anchoring.
(1) All new construction to be placed or substantially improved and
substantial improvements shall be anchored to prevent flotation,
collapse, or lateral movement of the structure.
(2) All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved

1:307
§ 185-17. Penalties for noncompliance.
No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, relocated to, extended,
converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this chapter
and other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this chapter
by failure to comply with any of its requirements (including violations of
conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall
constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this chapter or fails to
comply with any of its requirements shall upon conviction thereof be fined
not more than $500 or imprisoned for not more than 90 days, or both, for
each violation, and in addition shall pay all costs and expenses involved
in the case. Each day that such violation exists shall constitute a separate
and equal offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the Township of

has been provided and no floodway has been designated, the
accumulative effect of any proposed development, when combined with
all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the
water surface elevation of the base flood more than 0.2 of a foot at any
point.
A. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered
reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and
engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural
causes. this chapter does not imply that land outside the area of special
flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from
flooding or flood damages.
B. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the Township of
Lawrence, any officer or employee thereof or the Federal Insurance
Administration, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this
chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.

occupancy with residential and other uses on the same premises, all such
uses shall be nevertheless regulated by and subject to the provisions of this
chapter.
§ 309-8. Owner's and operator's liability.
Owners and operators shall have all the duties and responsibilities
prescribed in this chapter, and no owner or operator shall be relieved from

§ 309-47 and §§ 309-50 through 309-53 of this chapter, and the occupant

§ 309-12. Supplementary regulations; formulation and approval
effect.
The Public Officer is authorized to promulgate such written rules and
regulations as may be necessary for the proper interpretation and
administration of the provisions of this chapter, provided that such rules
and regulations do not conflict with this chapter but conform to the general
standards prescribed by this chapter. The Public Officer shall file copies
of such rules and regulations with the Municipal Clerk, Health Officer,
Municipal Engineer and Fire Marshal and shall make available in the Public
Officer's office a copy for inspection by members of the public during
regular business hours. Such rules and regulations shall have the approval
of the Health Officer, Municipal Engineer and Fire Marshal respectively,
where the provisions thereof relate to matters which are also in the
jurisdiction of and supervision of each Officer. In case of conflict, the rule or
regulation may be promulgated by direction of the Township Manager and

violations of the express provisions of this chapter.
§ 309-13. Annual review of provisions by officials.
The Public Officer shall, in the month of December of each year, review with
the Fire Marshal, Health Officer, Municipal Engineer, Township Manager,

§ 309-14. Inspections: nonresidential buildings and premises.
All nonresidential buildings and premises subject to this chapter are subject
to inspection annually and upon complaints by the enforcing officer, and
A. Any recommended amendment, addition or modification of provisions
of this chapter consonant with the filed experience of the personnel
charged with enforcement.
B. A summary of the enforcement experience indicating number of cases

other and further pertinent information as will provide the Mayor and
Council with an annual account of progress in securing the standards
required by this chapter.
C. Any further recommendation as to how this chapter and the procedure
and operations thereunder can be improved.
§ 309-11 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 309-14
1:389
such other times as are deemed necessary by the Public Officer. At the
time of such inspections, all rooms and parts of the premises shall be
available and accessible for such inspections, and the owner and operator
are required to provide the necessary arrangements to facilitate such
inspections. Such inspections shall be made during regular open hours of
the business occupying the premises unless there is reason to believe a
violation exists of a character which is an immediate threat to health or
safety, requiring inspection and abatement without delay.
§ 309-15. Inspectors; identification and conduct.
Inspectors shall be supplied with official identification and, shall exhibit
such identification when entering any nonresidential property or any part
of any premises subject to this chapter. Inspectors shall conduct themselves
so as to avoid intentional embarrassment or inconvenience to occupants.
§ 309-16. Refusal of entry for inspection; use of search warrants.
A. Where the Public Officer or his agent is refused entry or access or is
otherwise impeded or prevented by the owner, occupant or operator
from conducting an inspection of the premises, such person shall be in
violation of this chapter and subject to the penalties hereunder.
B. Emergency inspections may be authorized without warrant if the Public
Officer has reason to believe that a condition exists which poses an
immediate threat to life, health or safety. Such procedure shall only
take place where the time taken to apply for and secure the issuance of
a warrant would render ineffective the immediate action necessary to
abate the condition.
C. The Public Officer may, upon affidavit, apply to the Judge of the
Municipal Court of the Township for a search warrant, setting forth
factually the actual conditions and circumstances that provide a
reasonable basis for believing that a nuisance or violation of this
chapter may exist on the premises, including, but not limited to one or
more of the following:
(1) The premises require inspection according to the cycle established
by the Township for periodic inspections of premises of the type
involved.
(2) Observation of the external condition of the premises and its public
areas has resulted in the belief that violations of this chapter exist.
(3) Circumstances such as age of building, type of building, particular
use of premises or other such factors rendering systematic
inspections of such buildings necessary in the interest of public
health and safety.
D. If the Judge of the Municipal Court of the Township is satisfied as the
matter set forth in such affidavit, the Court shall authorize the issuance
of a search warrant permitting access to and inspection of that part of
§ 309-14 LAWRENCE CODE § 309-16
1:390
§ 309-17. Modifications or variances.
the premises on which the nuisance or violation may exist. Warrant for
access may be issued by the Judge of the Municipal Court upon affidavit
of the Public Officer, or designees, establishing grounds.
A. The Public Officer shall have the power to withhold strict enforcement
of the requirements of this chapter upon written application therefor by
an owner, operator or occupant, after making determination that:
(1) Any variation or modification of structure or use approved by the
Public Officer will not in any material way alter the standards of
this chapter and cannot affect detrimentally the health or safety of
occupants of the premises or the health, safety or welfare of the
occupants or owners of adjacent premises or of the neighborhood.
(2) Strict enforcement would constitute an undue and unnecessary
hardship on the owner, operator or occupant because it would
compel expenditures on the premises which would be substantially
disproportionate to any benefit to health, safety or welfare that
might be derived therefrom.
(3) The owner, operator or occupant is without any practical or feasible
means to comply with the strict provisions of this chapter.
(4) The strict enforcement of the provisions of this chapter would
require the installation of repairs and improvements estimated to
exceed $300 in cost, and the premises subject to this chapter are
contemplated for acquisition or are within an area where
acquisition is contemplated by a public agency having the power of
eminent domain and there is a reasonable likelihood that such
premises will be acquired within a period of two years; provided
that any waiver of the provisions of this chapter shall be cancelled
and the Public Officer shall strictly enforce this chapter if it shall be
ascertained subsequent to the granting of the waiver that the
premises are in fact not to be acquired for any public use or
purpose.
(5) Strict compliance with this chapter would require substantial
structural changes to the premises, and noncompliance will not
impair the health, safety or welfare of any person or persons.
(6) The nonconformity is of a technical and insubstantial character or
there is an alternative means, satisfactory to the Public Officer, to
be used which will eliminate violations of this chapter constituting
hazards to the health, safety and welfare of the occupants of the
premises and persons in the immediate vicinity thereof.
B. Upon denial of any such application the owner, operator or occupant
may request a hearing, which shall be held in accordance with the
provisions of § 309-24.
§ 309-16 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 309-17
1:391
§ 309-18. Record of modification and variances.

by the Public Officer or by action of any Court, a written record thereof
stating the name of the applicant, the address of the premises, the variation
or modification approved, date of approval and the reasons therefor
satisfying the provisions contained in this section shall be prepared by the
Public Officer and filed both under the section or sections to which the
variation or modification applies and under the address of the premises, and
such files shall be available for public inspection in the office of the Public
Officer during regular business hours.
§ 309-19. Inspections and status reports on request; applications.
§ 309-20. Scope and effect of inspection and status reports.
No inspection report or status report issued under § 309-19 shall be
construed as providing a defense against any violation of this chapter, this
Code or any other ordinance of the Township which may be discovered
thereafter, whether or not the condition or violation existed at the time
of any such inspection or status report. The inspection or status report is
provided as a convenience to the public and shall not constitute a limitation
or waiver of the full enforcement of this chapter. The inspection or status
report shall include only such matters as are embraced in this chapter.
C. Such application shall not constitute a defense of any violation of this
chapter concerning which any proceedings are pending in the
municipal court when the application is filed nor shall any variance or
modification allowed under this section constitute a vested right
against any ordinance enacted by the Township Council compelling
strict enforcement of any provisions of this chapter.
A. Whenever an owner, operator, occupant, prospective purchaser,
mortgagee or prospective occupant shall apply to the Public Officer for
an inspection in order to ascertain if any section has been violated, the
Public Officer shall, upon payment of the required fee, cause an
inspection to be made of the premises and issue an informational
certificate or report of the inspection to the applicant, indicating
therein any violations on the premises. The applicant for such
inspection shall state in writing his full name, residence and the
reasons and basis for which the inspection is requested. The Public
Officer may deny the application for failure to comply with this
requirement.
B. Where, in lieu of an inspection, an owner, operator, occupant, lessee,
prospective purchaser, mortgagee or prospective occupant requests a
status report as to whether or not there are any known violations
presently pending on the premises, upon payment of the required fee, a
copy of any notice or order on any violation then pending shall be sent
to the applicant.

§ 309-24. Notice of violation to become order unless hearing
requested.
Within 10 days of the date of service of a notice required by § 309-21 the
notice shall constitute a final order unless any person affected by the notice
requests a hearing thereon and serves a written request within the ten-day
period in person or by mail on the Public Officer. Such request for a hearing
shall set forth briefly the grounds or reasons on which the request for a
hearing is based and the factual matters contained in the notice of violation
which are to be disputed at the hearing. The Public Officer, upon receipt of
the request, shall, within 30 days therefrom and upon five days' notice to
the party aggrieved, set the matter down for hearing.
A. Notice required by § 309-21 shall be posted in a conspicuous location in
or on any nonresidential structure or premises in violation of
regulations of this chapter, such notice to state where and under what
conditions a copy of the notice may be obtained. Simultaneously with
posting, the notice shall be mailed to the responsible person, firm or
corporation at the last known address or principal place of business or
to the agent appointed by such person, firm or corporation pursuant to
these regulations.
B. Service may also be effected in person upon the individual owner,
operator, occupant or agent or upon a member of the family of such
persons over the age of 14.

any order for the enforcement of any such subpoena as provided by law.
Determination shall be made within 10 days from the completion of the
hearing. The Public Officer shall issue an order either incorporating the
determinations and directions contained in the notice, modifying the same
or withdrawing the notice.
§ 309-26. Notice and hearing not required under certain
circumstances.
A. Notwithstanding the requirements of §§ 309-21 to 309-25, violations of

309-55D as to the removal of accumulated snow or ice from paths,
walks, driveways, parking lots and parking areas used by pedestrians

eight hours of daylight after the termination of the snowfall.
C. Where the Public Officer, after hearing, shall determine that there was
a violation and a notice was served upon the owner, operator or
occupant, whether or not the violation was abated prior to the issuance
of an order, if thereafter within the space of one year there shall be a
second violation by the same owner, operator or occupant of the same
provision of this chapter discovered on the same premises, the offender
may be prosecuted on the second violation, without the Public Officer
first giving notice and opportunity for a hearing to the owner, operator
or occupant, by the filing of a complaint by the Public Officer in the
Municipal Court. Where the Public Officer has on two different
occasions found violations by the same owner, operator or occupant on
the same premises and has issued notices on each and has held at least
one hearing and issued an order thereon upon discovering a third or
subsequent violation by the same owner, operator or occupant on the
same premises within the space of one year, whether the same sections
or of any other sections of this chapter, the Officer may thereupon
prosecute the offender by filing a complaint in the Municipal Court for
the third or subsequent violation occurring within the period of one
year without first providing notice and opportunity for a hearing by the
Public Officer.

to exceed 90 days beyond the expiration date of the original notice.
§ 309-28. Summary abatement under certain conditions.
§ 309-29. Abatement by Township; cost.
Where abatement of any nuisance as defined in this chapter, correction
of a defect in the premises or bringing the premises into compliance with
the requirements of this Code or any municipal ordinance or State law
applicable thereto requires expending Township funds therefor, the Public
Officer shall present a report of work proposed to be done to accomplish
the foregoing to the Council with an estimate of the cost thereof, along with
a summary of the proceedings undertaken by the Public Officer to secure
compliance, including notices served upon the owners, operators, lessors

the abatement of the nuisance, correction of the defect or work necessary
to place the premises in proper condition and in compliance with the Code
or any ordinance of the Township and laws of the state. The Public Officer
may thereafter proceed to have the work performed in accordance with
the resolution at Township expense, not to exceed the amount specified in
the resolution, and shall, upon completion thereof, submit a report of the
funds expended and costs to the Council. After review of the same, the

immediately thereafter.
B. The Public Officer shall submit to the Council a report of the work done
and expenses incurred to abate such condition and the Council may

whereupon the same shall become a lien against the premises,
collectible as provided by law. Copy of such resolution shall be certified
by the Clerk and filed with the Collector of Taxes of the Township, who
shall be responsible for the collection thereof, and a copy of such report
and resolution shall be sent by certified mail to the owner of the
premises.
§ 309-27 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 309-29
1:395
of the resolution approving the expenses and costs shall be certified by

eliminate the violation by peaceable means within the period of time
specified in such notice, shall commence within such period legal action
to dispossess, evict or eject the occupants who cause the violation. No
further action shall then be taken against the owner or operator so long
as the action under this section is pending in the court and is prosecuted
expeditiously and in good faith.

adjoining premises not owned by him or under his control, and where right
of access has been refused the owner, operator or occupant, or where the
owner or person responsible for granting permission cannot be found or
located, then, upon the filing of affidavit setting forth the facts with the
Public Officer, the Public Officer shall serve a five-day written notice of a
hearing in accordance with the provisions for service contained in § 309-23
upon the owner, operator or occupant of any adjoining premises affected by
the application.
§ 309-34. Hearing on application for access.

of this chapter, the Public Officer may, upon affidavit, apply to the judge for
a warrant under the procedure set forth in § 309-16 authorizing access to
the premises under appropriate conditions and circumstances as provided
under § 309-35.
§ 309-37. Each violation separate; continuing violations.
Each violation of a provision of this chapter shall constitute a separate and
distinct violation, independent of any other provision. Each day's failure
to comply with any such section or subsection shall constitute a separate
violation.
§ 309-38. Where violator is not a natural person.
Where a defendant charged with a violation of this chapter is other than a
natural person, any agent, superintendent, officer, member or partner who
shall, along or with others, have charge, care or control of the premises,

against the commercial premises, collectible as provided by law. A copy of
the resolution approving the said expense shall be certified to the Municipal
Clerk and filed with the Tax Collector of the Township of Lawrence, who
shall be responsible for the collection thereof, and a copy of the report and

§ 325-16. Appeals.
§ 325-17. Rent increases for existing tenancies.

person or by certified mail with a notice of appeal specifying the
grounds thereof and the name and address of the appellant and name
and address of his attorney, if represented. Such appeal shall be
decided by the Council only upon the record established before the
Rent Stabilization Board, and such argument as pertains to the
established record.
B. The appellant shall, within five days of service of the notice of appeal,
arrange for a transcript of proceedings before the Rent Stabilization
Board to be prepared for use by the Council, and shall pay a deposit of
$50, or the estimated cost of such transcription, whichever is less;
otherwise, the appeal may be dismissed for failure to prosecute. The
Township Council may waive the transcription fee provided for in this
section in the event of economic hardship and upon application by an
appellant.
C. The Township Council may reverse, remand or affirm, wholly or in part,
or may modify the decision of the Rent Stabilization Board.
D. Any landlord intending to appeal a decision of the Board shall notify the
tenant or tenants who may be affected, personally or by certified mail,
at least 10 days in advance of filing the appeal. A tenant intending to
appeal shall similarly notify the landlord and shall follow the same
procedures set forth in this section. Service shall be deemed effective if
made upon the person or address at which rental payments are made,
unless a landlord designates otherwise in advance in writing.
A. Establishment of rents between landlords and tenants in all residential
multiple-family dwellings covered by this chapter shall hereafter be
subject to the provisions of this chapter. With respect to extensions and
§ 325-14 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 325-17
1:423
renewals of tenancies which are in existence as of the effective date of
this chapter, no landlord may request, impose, or receive a percentage
increase in rent greater than as follows:
(1) For extensions and renewals taking effect on or before December
31, 1985, the percentage increase for an apartment may not exceed
4% of the average rent levels for that apartment for the preceding
12 months. In calculating average rent for an apartment for the
preceding 12 months for any month in which no rent or less than
full rent was charged because of a vacancy, the rent to be employed
for calculation purposes is the last full month's rent charged for
that apartment.
(2) For extensions and renewals taking effect on or after January 1,
1986, the percentage increase for an apartment may not exceed
the percentage increase in the index provided for in Subsection B
hereof, calculated by comparing the index for the immediately
preceding calendar year at year's end with the year and index for
the calendar year immediately preceding that year. Thus, for
increases in 1986 governed by this section, the percentage
increase is to be determined by comparing the 1985 year's end
index with the 1984 year's end index. If, for example, the 1984
year's end index were 200, and the 1985 year's index were 210,
then the percentage increase allowable in 1986 would be
calculated as follows:
(210 - 200)
200
= 0.05
The aforesaid percentage increase would be applied to the
average rent for a particular apartment for the preceding 12
months as calculated in accordance with Subsection A(1) above
for the purposes of determining the maximum increase allowable.
Thus, if the index calculations were to produce a maximum
allowable percentage increase of 5% and if the average rent for
a particular apartment for the preceding 12 months were to be
$500, then the maximum allowable increase for that apartment on
an extension or renewal would be $25 ($500 x 0.05).
(3) For extensions and renewals taking effect on or after January 1,
1993, the percentage increase for an apartment may not exceed
the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for Urban
Wage Earners and Clerical Workers, Selected areas, All Items Index
(CPI-W, Table 3.), U.S. City Average, as published by the U.S.
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics, hereinafter
referred to as the "index," calculated by comparing the index for
the month of September in the immediately preceding calendar
year with the index for the month of September in the calendar
§ 325-17 LAWRENCE CODE § 325-17
1:424
§ 325-18. Powers of the Rent Stabilization Board.
year immediately preceding that year. Thus, for increases in 1993
governed by this section, the percentage increase is to be
determined by comparing the index for the month of September
1992 with the index for the month of September 1991. For
example, the index for the month of September 1991, was 135.2. If
the index for the month of September 1992 were to be 141.90, then
the percentage increase allowable in 1993 would be calculated as
follows:
141.90 - 135.2
135.2
= 0.05 (after rounding to the nearest 0.01) or 5%
The aforesaid percentage increase would be applied to the
average rent for a particular apartment for the preceding 12
months as calculated in accordance with Subsection A(1) above
for the purposes of determining the maximum increase allowable.
Thus, if the index calculations were to produce a maximum
allowable percentage increase of 5% and if the average rent for
a particular apartment for the preceding 12 months were to be
$500, then the maximum allowable increase for that apartment on
an extension or renewal would be $25 ($500 x 0.05).
B. Beginning January 1, 1986, the index to be utilized for making the
calculations called for by Subsection A(2) above shall be the December -
December Average Percent Change of the Consumer Price Index - CPI -
W - Table 3 U.S. City Average, All Items, as published by the U.S.
Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. Pending publication of
the index during any applicable year, the corresponding index of the
preceding year shall be utilized in calculating rent level changes.
A. Powers of Board.
(1) The Rent Stabilization Board shall have the power and duty to hold
hearings, engage in fact finding, reform leases to accord with the
provisions of this chapter and adjudicate hardship increases and
decreases in rents from the increases permitted herein, provided
no such hardship increase or decrease shall result in a total
increase or decrease which provides more or less, respectively,
than a just and reasonable rate of return to the landlord on the
landlord's investment.
(2) The Rent Stabilization Board shall and does have the power to
promulgate such regulations as are necessary and proper to
administer the provisions of this chapter and to fairly adjudicate all

units thereof.
(c) To insure, that, considering all applicable landlord operating
and financing costs, landlord may legally receive sufficient
rental income to provide a just and reasonable return.
(d) The foregoing factors permitting a hardship increase may also
be utilized to adjudicate hardship decreases where there is a
reduction in facilities, maintenance, repairs or services
rendered to any tenant by landlord or reduction in any

(2) The burden of proof shall be on the applicant, who shall comply

application. Any applications not complying with the provisions of
this chapter shall not be considered.
(5) All evidence of a financial nature submitted by any party to the

the residential multiple-family dwelling be placed in escrow, shall appoint a
trustee to take custody of such account, shall direct the trustee to provide
the maintenance, repairs, facilities or services in accord with public bidding
laws, and to pay therefor out of the escrow and shall order the landlord to
pay the trustee a reasonable fee for his services. The order shall continue
so long as the landlord fails to provide the required maintenance, repairs,
facilities and services.

more petitions involving the same landlord may, in the discretion of the
Board, be consolidated for a single hearing.
B. The failure of any party to a rent adjustment proceeding or any other
hearing before the Board to appear in defense of or in response to a
petition shall not be cause for the granting of the relief petitioned for;
provided, however, that the Board shall not be obligated to await the
appearance of any party failing to respond to a notice of a hearing and
may proceed to a hearing and determination upon whatever evidence is
produced before it.
C. If the Board shall determine that a tenant has been caused to pay
excessive rents in excess of the limitations provided herein, it shall
incorporate in its final determination an order compelling
reimbursement of the difference between the total amount paid in
excess and the amount determined by the Board as allowable under the
chapter, plus interest at current bank money market rates.

shall make an investigation of the prospective licensee, pursuant to this
chapter for the purpose of determining the suitability of the applicant
for licensing. The investigation shall include, but shall not be limited to,
the following:
(1) The experience of the applicant in the business of purchase and
sale of those articles or goods referred to in § 351-2 above,
although nothing in this section shall be construed to warrant
denial of a license solely on the basis of lack of experience;
(2) The reputation of the applicant for fair dealing in the community,
which shall be made among credible sources, which sources shall
be disclosed to the applicant in the event of a denial of any license;
(3) Any criminal record of the applicant, including any past convictions
for any business-related crime(s), disorderly persons offense(s), or
municipal ordinance violation(s) within this or any other
jurisdiction. The Chief of Police shall, as part of the application
process, require a fingerprint criminal background check through
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Criminal Justice Information
§ 351-3 LAWRENCE CODE § 351-4
1:438
Services Division, which shall require an additional fee from the
applicant.
(4) The type of operation contemplated to be conducted by the
applicant, particularly whether the business is to be operated from
a fixed location, whether it is to be conducted from a location
primarily devoted to the purchase and sale of precious metal or
other secondhand goods, and other factors bearing on whether the
licensed business will be of a fixed and permanent nature. This
section shall not be construed to require denial of any license solely
on the grounds that the business is not from a fixed location or that
the applicant is a transient buyer or itinerant business; however,
applicants who fall under the category of a transient buyer or
itinerant business must state with specificity on the license
application the business address where transaction records
required by § 351-5D of this chapter will be stored as well as the
location where purchased goods will be retained during the
mandatory inspection period required under § 351-6A.
B. The Chief of Police shall complete any investigation pursuant to this
chapter within 30 days of the submission of the application to the
Municipal Clerk, fully completed by the applicant. If a criminal record
check has been requested within the thirty-day period and has not been
received by the Chief of Police within that period, the Chief of Police
may, if all other factors are satisfactory, recommend a conditional
issuance of the license subject to the finding regarding criminal record.
C. The Chief of Police shall, upon completion of the investigation,
recommend "grant" or "denial" of the license to the Municipal Clerk,
who shall grant or deny the license. Any recommendation of the Chief of
Police shall be in writing and, in the case of a recommendation of
denial, shall state fully and specifically the reasons for said
recommendation. If the Chief of Police recommends to deny any license,
the applicant shall be notified in writing within 10 days of such denial
by the Municipal Clerk, and the Clerk shall forward to the applicant a
statement of the reason or reasons for such denial.
D. Grounds for recommending denial of license may include reliable
information indicating that the applicant has in the past engaged in
fraudulent or deceptive business practices in a business identical to or
similar to a dealer in secondhand goods. A license may be denied if the
investigation reveals a conviction of the applicant or any of its principal
officers or employees of any business-related crime(s), disorderly
persons offense(s) in which deceit or misrepresentation is an element;
or any conviction of any crime(s), disorderly persons offense involving
theft or the receiving of stolen goods, regardless of whether the
applicant was a principal, accessory before the fact, after the fact, or a
co-conspirator; or any prior municipal ordinance violation(s) by the
applicant or any of its principal officers or employees in this or any
other jurisdiction. A license may be denied if the applicant fails to
demonstrate an ability to satisfactorily comply with the electronic

Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Chief of Police, the
Municipal Clerk shall issue or deny the license accordingly, contingent
upon the receipt of a bond as required by § 351-7 of this chapter.
E. Whenever any application for a permit is denied, the applicant shall be
entitled to a hearing before a three-person panel appointed by the Chief
of Police, at which time the applicant shall be permitted to introduce

and transient buyers will be responsible for notifying the Chief of Police
of the address where these records and articles will be stored.

N.J.S.A. 2C:20-4 on behalf of the dealer, who shall be considered the
"victim" of the offense for the purposes of N.J.S.A. 2C:43-3. The officer
shall seize the goods, provide the dealer with a receipt, and issue a
criminal complaint against the seller for theft by deception and any
other criminal charges for which the officer has probable cause that the
seller has committed. If convicted of theft by deception and if so found
by an order of a court of valid jurisdiction, the seller will be responsible
for providing restitution to the dealer under N.J.S.A. 2C:44-2 for the
amount paid by the dealer to the seller for the stolen goods.

Clerk, which shall set forth the grounds for the suspension and
notify the dealer of his or her right to appeal pursuant to
Subsection G. A temporary suspension shall issue immediately,

immediately cease engaging in the business of purchasing for
resale, receiving for pawn, and/or selling of precious metals and/or
other secondhand goods in the municipality until reinstatement.
(3) Reinstatement. Suspended dealers may be reinstated only when

by a judgment of a court of proper jurisdiction. Said bond shall contain the
following language: "The obligation of this bond shall, in addition to the
Township of Lawrence, be and remain for the benefit of any person who

provided to the dealer. If the panel determines that suspension is
the appropriate disposition, it shall provide the dealer with a notice

Traffic Control Standards; Requirements for Construction and
Maintenance
[Amended 3-6-2018 by Ord. No. 2291-18]
§ 435-8. Purpose and scope.
The purpose of this article is to establish controls and regulations for
the safe and expeditious movement of traffic through the Township of
Lawrence, in order to promote public health, safety and welfare, when
construction, maintenance, repairs or utility work require blocking the
streets and obstructing normal flow of traffic.
§ 435-9. Adoption of standards.
The Township of Lawrence hereby adopts the current Manual of Uniform
Traffic Control Devices, hereby known as "MUTCD"' as same may be
supplemented and amended. The MUTCD controls and regulates traffic
whenever construction, maintenance operations or utility work obstructs
the normal flow of traffic. Any person, entity, contractor or utility that fails
to comply with the provisions of the MUTCD while performing such work is
in violation of this section.
§ 435-10. Preconstruction meeting.
It shall be the responsibility of the person, contractor or public utility, as
required under the public utility agreement, N.J.A.C. 16:25-9.2, wishing to
conduct work on, under or above the roadway to contact the Lawrence
Township Chief of Police or designee in order to arrange a preconstruction
meeting in order to submit plans for the safe movement of traffic during
such period of construction or work. The preconstruction meeting shall
take place at least one week prior to the start date of the construction or
maintenance work. Any person, contractor or utility who fails to submit and
secure approval for its traffic plan prior to the start of work shall be deemed
to be in violation of this chapter. The requirement to obtain approval of the
plans shall be in addition to any other permit or other approval required by
any other federal, state or municipal law, ordinance or regulation, including
the Lawrence Township Ord. No. 21-21 entitled "Street Excavations."
§ 435-11. Emergency contact telephone numbers; correction of
hazardous conditions by the Township.
The person, contractor or utility shall provide the Lawrence Township Police
Traffic Safety Bureau with at least two emergency-contact phone numbers
to be called if emergency problems occur at the construction or
maintenance site, or arising from the construction or maintenance being
performed, prior to the start of any work. If, for any reason, emergency
contacts cannot be reached or if the emergency-contact person does not
respond to a call from the Lawrence Township Police Department to correct
a hazardous condition, the Township of Lawrence may respond to correct
§ 435-8 GENERAL PROVISIONS § 435-11
1:545
such hazardous condition. The reasonable fees for such emergency services
by the Township of Lawrence shall be charged to the person, contractor
or utility responsible for such condition. The reasonable fees will include
the labor (based on current collective bargaining agreements), material and
equipment costs.
§ 435-12. Roadway defined.
"Roadway" shall include any county, municipal, private road, or area within
the boundaries of the Township of Lawrence in which the Lawrence
Township Police Department has New Jersey Title 39 authority. Any
exception from included roadways shall be made by the Chief of Police and
shall be binding.
§ 435-13. Time limits.
§ 435-14. Road closings and detours.
Road closings and/or traffic detours shall not be permitted unless approved
by the Lawrence Township Chief of Police of designee. Advance notice of
detours must be given to motorists, except in emergent situations.
§ 435-15. Traffic directors.
A. There shall be no construction, maintenance operations or utility work
under, on or above any roadway, as defined above, in the Township
before the hour of 9:00 a.m. or after 3:00 p.m.
B. This time limit may be adjusted to permit work prior to 9:00 a.m. or
after 3:00 p.m. by the officer in charge of the Traffic Bureau of the
Lawrence Township Police Department. If it is determined by the officer
in charge of the Lawrence Township Police Traffic Bureau that the
construction or maintenance operations prior to 9:00 a.m. or after 3:00
p.m. on any roadway would substantially delay traffic or cause a safety
or health hazard or create a noise nuisance, the work shall then be
permitted only between 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m.
A. For the purposes of this section, a traffic director is that individual who
is responsible for traffic control at a roadway work site and is either a
sworn law enforcement officer or a civilian flagger who meets the
qualifications as set forth in Section 6E of the MUTCD and is certified
as a flagger by the American Traffic Safety Services Association,
Rutgers University or comparable organization, approved by the Chief
of Police.
B. Traffic directors shall be posted at all construction or maintenance sites
when deemed necessary and approved by the Lawrence Township Chief
of Police or designee to provide for the safety and expeditious
movement of traffic.
§ 435-11 LAWRENCE CODE § 435-15
1:546
§ 435-16. Stoppage of work.
The Lawrence Township Police Department shall have authority to stop
work being performed within the Township, and to require the removal of
equipment, vehicles and/or stored material within the right-of-way, or the
backfilling of open excavations and/or other related work, in order to abate
any nuisance and/or safety hazard, or for any violations of this chapter.
§ 435-17. Site preparation and maintenance.
No materials, vehicles or equipment are to be placed in any roadway or
sidewalk areas until all construction signs, lights, devices and pavement
markings are installed and approved. All construction signs that will not
apply during construction, such as "Flagman Ahead" or "Utility Work
Ahead" signs, after all work has been completed for the day, must be bagged
or removed from the view of motorists.
§ 435-18. Emergency repair work.
C. Civilian flaggers shall not be used as traffic directors in any work zone
which contains an intersection with a traffic control device or any
portion of a roadway which contains a traffic control device. In those
situations, only a sworn law enforcement officer will be used as a traffic
director. "Traffic control signal" shall be defined by N.J.S.A. 39:1-1.
"Official traffic control devices" means all signs, signals, lane markings,
and devices not inconsistent with this subtitle placed or erected by
authority of a public body or official having jurisdiction for the purpose
of regulating, warning, or guiding traffic. [Amended at time of
adoption of Code (see Ch. 1, General Provisions, Art. I)]
D. If civilian flaggers are utilized, they shall wear high-visibility safety
apparel that meets the Performance Class 2 or 3 requirements of the
ANSI/ISEA 107-2004 publication entitled "American National Standard
for High-Visibility Apparel and Headwear" and labeled as meeting the
ANSI 107-2004 standard performance for Class 2 or 3 risk exposure,
and shall be visible at a minimum distance of 1,000 feet. The
retroreflective safety apparel shall be designed to clearly identify the

police, fire, EMS and the school transportation offices, of any work or
construction upon or near a roadway within the Township of Lawrence
that would delay or interfere with the provision of service. The Lawrence
Township Police Department shall utilize Nixle messaging, or other public
alerting system in use at the time, to notify citizens of any road closure or
traffic delay created by any work or construction. Such notifications shall
be made in a manner pursuant to, and in compliance with, the Lawrence
Township Police Department's policy and procedures.
A. In the case of emergency repair work where construction maintenance
operations or emergency utility work must be performed that will
obstruct, interfere or detour traffic on any roadway in the Township, the
person, contractor or utility performing such operation shall notify the
Lawrence Township Police Department of such emergency operation.
The person, contractor or utility shall disclose the nature of the
emergency, location and proposed hours of operation.
B. All emergency construction and maintenance operations shall be

ARTICLE III
Parking, Stopping and Standing
§ 435-21. Regulations not exclusive.
The provisions of this chapter imposing a time limit on parking shall not
relieve any person of the duty to observe other, more restrictive provisions
prohibiting or limiting the stopping or standing or parking of vehicles as set
forth in N.J.S.A. 39:4-138, any other New Jersey Statute or as hereinafter
provided.
§ 435-22. Parking prohibited during state of emergency.
§ 435-23. Temporary parking prohibition for snow plowing and
removal. [Amended by Ord. No. 1836-05]
A. Upon the declaration of an emergency, there shall be no parking upon
the streets where temporary emergency "No Parking" signs are
displayed. The Chief of Police or, in his absence, the ranking police
officer, is authorized to declare an emergency and to direct the posting
of emergency "No Parking" signs when weather conditions, accidents,
road construction, fire or public celebrations dictate or require
avoidance of hazards or other conditions which interfere with the free
flow of traffic. Notification that emergency "No Parking" signs are being
or will be posted shall be given to the operator or owner of any vehicle
which has been parked prior to the posting of the signs.
B. The effectiveness of this subsection is contingent upon the signs being
erected as required by law.
A. Whenever snow has fallen and the accumulation is such that it covers
the roadway, an emergency shall exist and no vehicle shall be parked on
the streets or roads or portions thereof indicated.

Ordinance. [Ord. 2340-19, 8/20/19]
§ 302 Interpretation of Boundaries.
A. Zoning district boundary lines are intended to follow street centerlines, railroad rights-ofway,
streams and lot or property lines as they exist on lots of record at the time of enactment
of this Ordinance unless otherwise indicated by dimensions on the zoning map. Any
dimensions shown shall be in feet and measured horizontally and, when measured from a
street, shall be measured from the street right-of-way line even if the centerline of that street
is used for the location of a zoning district line. The exact location of any disputed zoning
district boundary line shall be determined by the Board of Adjustment pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-70b.
B. Where boundaries are not fixed by dimensions and where they approximately follow lot lines
and where they do not scale more than 20 feet distant therefrom, the street centerlines,
railroad rights-of-way, streams and lot lines shall be construed to be such boundaries.
C. Where a zoning district boundary divides a lot, the location of the boundary, unless indicated
by dimensions on the zoning map, shall be determined by use of the stated scale on the map.
§ 303 Applicability within Each District.
The zoning standards, controls and designations apply to every structure, lot and use within each
district and the district line extends vertically in both directions from ground level.

ARTICLE IV
ZONING DISTRICT REGULATIONS
§ 400 General Regulations and Permitted Modifications
A. Relationship to Other Articles. This Article establishes the use, bulk requirements and other
regulations governing the zones created in Article III. Article II is the compendium of
definitions for terms of art in this Article and throughout the Land Use Ordinance.
Performance regulations and design standards are contained in Article V that provides the
basis for the physical development and redevelopment of land within the zoning
classifications. Article VII contains the standards of review upon which all applications for
subdivision or site plan are measured.
B. Variances. Deviations from the performance and design standards for certain sections in

Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §400
56
D. Requirements for Special Lots.
1. Corner lot. A corner lot shall be considered to have two front yards, one side yard,
and one rear yard. The rear yard shall be considered the yard area opposite the front
yard that is established by the location of the front door to the building. Houses
angled on the lot where the front door faces the intersection of the rights-of-way
shall have side and rear yards established at the time of construction of the principal
structure and so recorded by the Administrative Officer. In the event that a
residential corner lot abuts three rights-of-way, the front yards shall be considered
those fronting on a residential access or residential subcollector street. The rear yard
shall be considered that portion of the lot abutting an arterial or collector street.
2. Reverse frontage lots. Lots which have frontage on both a residential access or
subcollector street and another street shall establish the front yard facing the interior
lowest order street and the rear yard abutting the higher order street.
3. Frontage on cul-de-sacs or curved streets. The minimum lot frontage may be
reduced on curved alignments with an outside radius of less than 500 feet to not less
than 75% of the required minimum provided that the width of the lot at the building
setback line is equal to or greater than the lot frontage requirement.
4. Frontage on corner lots. The minimum frontage requirement for any lot shall be met
by the lowest order street. In the case of a corner lot with two streets of the same
hierarchy, either residential street frontage may meet the minimum lot frontage
required for that zone.
5. No public sewer. Where no public sewer is available, the minimum lot size shall be
one acre. Area, yard and building coverage restrictions shall be as required for the
R-1 zoning district.
E. Permitted Modifications for Infill Development. The size and intensity of development of
principal dwellings on infill development lots within specified residential districts are limited
by the size and intensity of pre-existing residential development within the Neighborhood
Context of the infill development. The yard areas of principal dwellings on infill
development lots may encroach within the yard areas as otherwise required in this Ordinance
under the following conditions [Ord. 1920-07; 3/6/07]:
1. Front Yard. The front yard depth may be reduced to the average of the setbacks
from the streetline of existing dwellings on both sides of the proposed residence. In
the event an adjacent lot is vacant, the average shall be calculated using the required
setback for the vacant lot.
2. Side Yard. The side yard may be reduced to the depth of the side yard of the
adjacent lot but in no instance shall the distance between dwellings be reduced to
less than 10 feet.
3. Rear Yard. A portion of the principal dwelling may encroach into the rear yard up
to 20% of the required depth provided that the average of the building's distance
from the rear property line meets or exceeds the required setback.
F. Non-conforming Lots. The following requirements shall apply to non-conforming lots:
1. Merging of substandard lots. Except for lots which have been legally created since
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §400
57
December 3, 1969, whenever title to two or more contiguous lots is held by the same
owner, regardless of whether or not each of the lots may have been approved as
portions of a subdivision or acquired by separate conveyance or by other operation
of law, and one or more individual lots should, by reason of exceptional
shallowness, topographical conditions, substandard area or yard space or similar
measurements, not conform with the minimum lot area and dimension requirements
for the zone in which it is located, the contiguous lots shall be merged into a single
lot.
2. Non-conformity from public dedication. Whenever the owner of a lot existing at the
time of adoption of this Ordinance has dedicated or conveyed land to the
municipality in order to meet the minimum street width requirement of the official
map or master plan of the municipality, the construction official shall issue building
and occupancy permits for the lot whose depth and/or areas are rendered
substandard in area only because of such dedication and where the owner has no
other adjacent lands to provide the minimum requirements.
3. Expansion of building on undersized lot. Any existing lot on which a building or
structure is located and which lot does not meet the minimum lot size, or a structure
which violates any yard requirements, may have additions to the principal building
and/or construction of an accessory building without any appeal for variance relief
provided:
a. The existing use(s) on the lot are conforming to the permitted use(s)
stipulated in this Ordinance for the lot in question; and
b. The total permitted building coverage is not exceeded; and
c. The accessory building and/or addition do not violate any other
requirements of this Ordinance including, but not limited to, height, setback,
and parking. Any such building and/or addition may violate a setback
requirement so long as the accessory building or addition intrudes no more
into the required setback than the principal building. [Ord. 1585-99, 9/7/1999]
4. Undersized vacant lots. Any vacant lot existing as a conforming residential lot on
July 6, 1989, whose area or dimensions do not meet the requirements of the district
in which the lot is located, may have a building permit issued for a single-family
detached dwelling and its permitted accessory uses without an appeal for variance
relief provided:
a. Single-family detached dwellings are a permitted use in that district; and
b. The building coverage limit is not exceeded; and
c. Parking requirements are met. Applicants shall have the burden of proof in
establishing that the undersized vacant lot has not been merged by operation
of law by virtue of common ownership of an adjoining lot(s).
G. Non-Conforming Structures and Uses. The following requirements shall apply to nonconforming
structures and uses:
1. Continuance. Any non-conforming use or structure existing at the time of the
passage of this Ordinance may be continued upon the lot or in the structure so
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §400
58
occupied and any such structure may be restored or repaired in the event of partial
destruction thereof. Any such use or structure which is substantially destroyed shall
not be reconstructed or used except in conformance with this Ordinance.
2. Repair. Repairs and maintenance work required to keep a structure in sound
condition may be made to a non-conforming structure containing a non-conforming
use. However, no non-conforming structure or structure containing a nonconforming
use shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed or
structurally altered in any manner without an appeal for variance relief.
3. Certificate of non-conforming use. The prospective purchaser, prospective
mortgagee, or any other person interested in any land upon which a non-conforming
use or structure exists may apply in writing for the issuance of a certificate certifying
that the use or structure existing before the adoption of the ordinance which
rendered the use or structure non-conforming. The applicant shall have the burden
of proof. Application pursuant hereto may be made to the Administrative Officer
within one year of the adoption of the ordinance which rendered the use or structure
non-conforming or at any time to the Zoning Board of Adjustment. The
Administrative Officer shall be entitled to demand and receive for such certificate
issued by him a reasonable fee not in excess of those provided in R.S. 54:5-14 and
R.S. 54:5-15. The fees collected by the official shall be paid by him to the
municipality. Denial by the Administrative Officer shall be appealable to the
Zoning Board of Adjustment.
H. Accessory Buildings. The following regulations shall apply to all accessory buildings:
1. Accessory buildings as part of principal buildings. Any accessory building attached
to a principal building shall be considered part of the principal building and the total
structure shall adhere to the yard requirements for the principal building regardless
of the technique of connecting the principal and accessory buildings.
2. Accessory buildings not to be constructed prior to principal building. No
construction permit shall be issued for the construction of an accessory building
prior to the issuance of a construction permit for the construction of the main
building upon the same premises. If construction of the main building does not
precede or coincide with the construction of the accessory building, the construction
official shall revoke the construction permit for the accessory building until
construction of the main building has proceeded substantially toward completion.
3. Distance between adjacent buildings. The minimum distance between an accessory
building and any other building(s) on the same lot shall be as prescribed in Article
IV except that no poultry or livestock shelter shall be erected closer than 100 feet to
any dwelling or lot line, except when part of a home agriculture use. [Ord. 2251-16,
12/6/16]
4. Location and setback of accessory buildings. An accessory building or structure
may be erected in side and rear yard areas only and shall be set back from property
lines as required in Article IV. In the event that no accessory building or structure
setback is established in the particular district, the setback requirements for principal
buildings shall apply.

penthouses or roof structures for the housing of stairways, tanks, ventilating fans, air
conditioning equipment or similar equipment required to operate and maintain the building,
skylights, spires, cupolas, flagpoles, chimneys or similar structures may be erected above the
height limits prescribed by this Ordinance but in no case shall such extension exceed 10% of
the maximum height permitted in the district.

§ 401 Environmental Protection 1 (EP-1) District.
A. Purpose. The Environmental Protection 1 district is designed for low intensity uses primarily
in the northwest area of the municipality where poor water yields and strata for septic
systems dictate large lot development in an area of little or no public infrastructure and
severe environmental constraints, including but not limited to, a seasonal high water table,
shallow depth to bedrock, and steep slopes along the Stony Brook. Further, the purpose of
the EP-1 district is to protect the environmental resources and qualities of this area, maintain
the rural character of roads and scenic views, and retain farmland. The EP-1 designation is
contrasted with the EP-2 district by being underlain with the Lockatong-Argillite geologic
formation as depicted in the adopted Master Plan. Both the EP-1 and EP-2 districts, though
poorly suited for development, are exceptional areas for non-irrigated agriculture. Because
of this last factor, clustering of residential units is preferred whether under the provisions of
this section or §428.
B. Permitted Uses. In the Environmental Protection 1 zone, no lot shall be used and no
structure shall be erected, altered or occupied for any purpose except the following:
1. Agriculture.
2. Farmstead.
3. Single family detached dwelling.
4. Residential cluster option.
5. Public parks and recreation.
6. Conservation.
7. Municipal use.
8. Cemetery.
C. Accessory Uses Permitted. Any of the following uses may be permitted when used in
conjunction with a principal use and conforming to the applicable subsection in §429:
1. Private residential swimming pool and cabana.
2. Private residential tool shed.
3. Recreational vehicle storage.
4. Outdoor recreational facilities, including tennis or other court sports.
5. Off-street parking and private garage.
6. Fences and walls.
7. Deck/patio. [Ord. 1585-99, 9/7/1999]
8. Signs.
9. Home occupation.
10. Accessory apartment pursuant to §429.A. [Ord. 1585-99, 9/7/1999]
11. ECHO housing.

12. Satellite dish and television antennae.
13. Farm stand and consumer crop picking operations when used in conjunction with an
agricultural use.

§ 402 Environmental Protection 2 (EP-2) District.
A. Purpose. The Environmental Protection 2 district is designed for low intensity uses primarily
in the northwest area of the municipality where poor water yields and strata for septic
systems dictate large lot development in an area of little or no public infrastructure and
severe environmental constraints, including but not limited to, a seasonal high water table,
shallow depth to bedrock, and steep slopes along the Stony Brook. Further, the purpose of
the EP-2 district is to protect the environmental resources and qualities of this area, maintain
the rural character of roads and scenic views, and retain farmland. The EP-2 designation is
contrasted with the EP-1 district by being underlain with the Brunswick Shale or Stockton
Sandstone geologic formations as depicted in the adopted Master Plan which yield slightly
better water supplies. Both the EP-1 and EP-2 districts, though poorly suited for
development, are exceptional areas for non-irrigated agriculture. Because of this last factor,
clustering of residential units is preferred whether under the provisions of this section or
§428.
B. Permitted Uses. In the Environmental Protection 2 zone, no lot shall be used and no
structure shall be erected, altered or occupied for any purpose except the following:
1. Agriculture.
2. Farmstead.
3. Single family detached dwelling.
4. Residential cluster option.
5. Public parks and recreation.
6. Conservation.
7. Municipal use.
8. Cemetery.
C. Accessory Uses Permitted. Any of the following uses may be permitted when used in
conjunction with a principal use and conforming to the applicable subsection in §429:
1. Private residential swimming pool.
2. Private residential tool shed.
3. Recreational vehicle storage.
4. Outdoor recreational facilities, including tennis or other court sports.
5. Off-street parking and private garage.

district is particularly established for the west side Alternate Route 1, south of Whitehead
Road where the goal is to eventually create a commercial boulevard with a unified
architecture and landscaped median strip.

PERFORMANCE AND DESIGN STANDARDS
PART II - LAWRENCE TOWNSHIP STANDARDS
§ 520 Performance Standards for All Uses.
An applicant for a zoning or construction permit shall provide documentation that the intended use
will comply with the performance standards enumerated below. In the case of a structure being
built where the future use is not known, a construction permit may be issued with the condition that
no certificate of occupancy will be issued until such time as this documentation is submitted with
respect to the particular occupant. A change in the occupancy or use of a building or portion of a
building or premises for a non-residential use shall cause the zoning permit to expire, requiring the
application and issuance of a new zoning permit for such new or changed use and occupancy and
consequently require the application for and issuance of a certificate of occupancy or certificate of
continuing occupancy, as the case may be, from the Construction Code Official. See Article XII.
[Ord. 2250-16, 12/6/16]
A. Electrical and/or Electronic Devices. All electrical or electronic devices shall be subject to
the provisions of Public Law 90-602, 90th Congress, HR 10790, dated October 1968,
entitled An Act for the Protection of Electronic Product Radiation. Radiation products, as
defined in DHEW Publication No. (FDA) 76-8003, shall be so limited and controlled so that
no measurable energy can be recorded at any point beyond the property boundaries. The
applicant, upon request, shall certified data wherein measurements made in accordance with
the procedure and standards set forth in the DHEW Publication No. (FDA) 75-8003
adequately demonstrate compliance with the minimum standards established by the Act. All
other forms of electromagnetic radiation lying between one hundred (100) KHz and ten (10)
GHz shall be restricted to the technical limits established in the Federal Communication
Commissions Rules and Regulations. Additionally, electric or electronic equipment shall be
shielded so there is no interference with any radio or television reception at the lot line (or
beyond the operators dwelling unit in the case of multi-family dwellings) as the result of the
operation of such equipment.
B. Glare. No use shall produce a strong, dazzling light or a reflection of a strong, dazzling light
or glare beyond its lot lines. Exterior lighting shall be shielded, buffered, and directed so
that glare, direct light or reflection will not become a nuisance to adjoining properties,
adjoining dwelling units, adjoining properties, adjoining dwelling units, adjoining districts or
streets.
C. Heat. No use shall produce heat perceptible beyond its lot lines. Further, no use shall be
permitted which would cause the temperature to rise or fall in any body of water.
D. Noise. Noise levels shall be designed and operated in accordance with local regulations and
those rules established by the New Jersey State Department of Environmental Protection as
they are adopted and amended.

form or manner that they may be transferred off the lot by natural causes or forces, nor shall
any substance be deposited which can contaminate an underground aquifer or otherwise
render such underground aquifer undesirable as a source of water supply or recreation, or
which will destroy aquatic life. All materials or wastes which might cause fumes or dust or
which constitute a fire hazard or which may be edible or otherwise attractive to rodents or
insects shall be stored indoors and enclosed in appropriate containers adequate to eliminate
such hazards.
G. Ventilation. No use shall obstruct the natural ventilation of adjacent uses nor contaminate the
air with excessive heat or odor. Further, no air conditioners or exhaust fans shall be
permitted to discharge exhausted air unless set back from all property lines 10 feet or
equipped with baffles to deflect the discharged air away from the adjacent use.

§ 521 Commercial and Industrial Buildings Design Standards.
A. Design Goals for All Building Types.
1. Buildings shall be designed and sited so that they provide visual interest and create
enjoyable human-scaled spaces.
2. Building design should blend with the natural terrain to minimize grading and create
an organic approach to the existing landscape.
3. Designs should be compatible in form and proportion with surrounding and
neighborhood buildings in the general vicinity.
4. Building designers should strive for creativity in form and space wherever contrast
and variety are appropriate to the larger environment.
B. Design Guidelines for All Building Types.
1. Proportion. A development's buildings should be designed so as to relate to the
proportions of architectural forms, planes, and details within the existing physical
context of the site. Proportions are the ratios established by the length, width, and
height and may exist as planar or volumetric measurements. Doors, windows, stairs,
porches, pediments, architraves, roof shapes, and entire facades are frequently used
as the elements that create proportion.
2. Horizontal building elements. Buildings shall be designed with a base, middle, and
top facade.
3. Scale. Designs should incorporate architectural elements that give scale, or a sense
of scale to buildings. Scale is the relationship of a person to a building.
4. Entrances. Entrances should clearly identify important access points, provide an
introductory architectural statement to the building and be landscaped in a fashion
complementary to the architectural elements of the entranceway.
5. Building elevation. All elevations of a building's exterior should be coordinated
with regard to color, materials, architectural form and detailing.
6. Facade treatment. The number of different materials on exterior facades should be
limited to three types.
7. Color and texture. The color and texture of a building aids in the expression of
scale, location of entrances, and provides architectural unity to the building. Offsets
in walls and building masses should be used to create visual interest in simple
buildings.
C. Roof Design Guidelines.
1. Roof shape, color, and texture should be coordinated with the exterior materials of
the building's facade.
2. Roof design should minimize the negative impact of roof protrusions by grouping
plumbing vents, ducts, and other utility structures together.
3. All rooftop mechanical and electrical equipment, including elevator penthouses,
shall be screened from the view of persons at ground level by a parapet wall, within
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §521
198
the roof structure itself, or removal to a screened ground level structure.
4. Buildings under 6,000 gross square feet in footprint should be designed with a
pitched roof such as a gable, hip, or gambrel not less than 4 inches in rise for every
12 inches in run unless necessary to meet guidelines established for the Historic
District.
D. Building Lighting.
1. Exterior lighting should be architecturally integrated with the building's style,
material and color.
2. Lighting focused downward should be used to reinforce pedestrian and vehicular
circulation (see also §526). Upward focused lighting should be used to highlight
architectural elements of the building facade.
E. Long Term Care Facility, Congregate Care, and Assisted Living Facility. The following
additional design standards for long term care, congregate care, and assisted living facility
shall apply:
1. Double loaded, rectangular, slab-configured structures are expressly prohibited.
2. The exterior of the building shall be designed to visually break up any facade in
excess of 50 lineal feet. A minimum of a 25 foot wide offset or building wing shall
be provided in each 200 lineal feet of facade length. The design should distinguish
between the base, middle, and top of the building.
3. Where an outdoor living space is required, adequate visual screening from all other
neighboring dwelling units, outdoor living spaces, parking areas and roadways shall
be provided. Screening may be accomplished with plant materials, masonry
structures or wood fencing a minimum of 4 feet in height. Architectural elements,
such as masonry walls and fences, shall be compatible in both style and materials
with the dwelling unit.
4. All utility meters or boxes, air compressors, heat pumps, or other exterior equipment
shall be located at the side or rear of buildings and shall be screened by architectural
elements or landscape plantings.
F. Neighborhood Center Design Standards. The following additional design standards for uses
permitted in the NC-1 and NC-2 districts shall apply:
1. Buildings should be two to two-and-a-half stories in height and located within 10
feet of the streetline.
2. Apartment uses above the first floor are encouraged.
3. Sidewalks along public streets should be a minimum of 10 feet wide with at least 6.5
feet free of street furniture, trees, and other pedestrian obstacles. These sidewalks
may be a combination of concrete, patterned concrete, brick and concrete pavers. If
a pattern is used, the long axis of the pattern should be oriented parallel to main
pedestrian travel.
4. Pedestrian pathways shall be established from any rear parking lot to the street
sidewalk system in the front and side(s) of a building (if applicable) and shall be a
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §521
199
minimum of 6 feet wide.
5. First and second or higher floors should be separated by means of belt or string
courses, pent roofs, awnings, porte-chocéres or similar architectural elements;
however, mansard roofs shall not be permitted.
6. Retail stores oriented towards a street or a pedestrian walkway connecting to other
adjacent lots shall have a minimum of 50% of the first floor building facade consist
of glass display windows. No more than 6 lineal feet out of each 25 feet shall be
permitted to be blank wall.
7. Exterior building materials should primarily be brick, wood siding, wood shingle, or
stucco.
8. The primary entrance to a building should be accessed directly from a public street
with secondary access oriented towards parking lots.
9. Entrances to apartments on upper floors should be oriented towards associated
parking.
10. Locations for the parking of bicycles shall be provided.
G. Professional Office District Design Standards. The following additional design standards for
professional offices shall apply:
1. Parking lots shall be oriented to the side and rear of the building line established by
the front wall of the building.
2. Dormers should be used to visually break up large roof masses.
3. Windows should be double hung sash types with the glass area divided by horizontal
and vertical muntins.
4. Exterior materials should be brick, stone, horizontal siding or wood shingle, or a
combination of such materials.
H. Retail Design Standards. The following additional design standards for retail uses shall
apply:
1. Retail stores oriented towards a street shall have a minimum of 50% of the first floor
building facade consist of glass display windows.
2. Building entrances should be oriented towards the street.
3. Common concrete block shall not be used on any elevation visible from a public
street. Where permitted, common concrete block shall be painted or otherwise
finished.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §521
200
I. Industrial and Warehousing Use Design Standards. The following additional design
standards for industrial uses shall apply:
1. Variation in the apparent height of the building shall be used to articulate its mass
either through actual changes in roof height or through the use of varying parapet
walls.
2. Vertical offsets at least two feet in depth shall be introduced for each 100 feet of
building length.
3. The exterior facade should be designed with one dominant material. This material
should be varied through the use of vertical and horizontal elements that create
texture changes along building facades.
4. The front and two side elevations shall be constructed of brick, architectural
concrete masonry units (i.e., split face block) or architectural precast concrete a
minimum of 50% of the facade. Metal siding or panels shall be limited to no more
than 50% of the facade. Where glass is used or required, the percentage of masonry
or metal shall be correspondingly reduced. Common concrete block shall not be
used on any elevation visible from a public street. Where permitted, common
concrete block shall be painted or otherwise finished.
5. At least 20% of the front elevation of the building shall consist of glass window.
J. New and Used Automobile Sales Buildings. The following additional design standards for
new and used automobile sales buildings shall apply: [Ord. 2166-13, 12/3/13]
1. The showroom should be the most prominent architectural feature of the building
and should have a two story volume.
2. The total front façade of the building facing the highest order street, excepting a
limited access highway, shall consist of at least 30% clear glass, and any portion
distinguishable from other portions of the building as the facilitys showroom shall
be at least 50% clear glass.
3. The remaining façade materials should be stone, brick, metal panel or tinted glass,
except those areas not visible from a public street may be architectural concrete
masonry units.
4. Service bays should be oriented to the sides or rear of a building.
5. Exterior display of vehicles, when permitted, shall be located at ground level and
demarcated with textured paving materials to distinguish the area from customer
parking.

§ 522 Drainage and Storm Water Management.
[Ord. 1873-06, 2/7/2006]
A. Purpose. It is hereby determined that the lands and waterways within the municipality are at
times subjected to flooding; that such flooding is a danger to the lives and property of the
public; that such flooding is also a danger to the natural resources of the municipality, the
county and the State; that development tends to accentuate such flooding by increasing storm
water runoff due to alteration of the hydrologic response of the watershed in changing from
the undeveloped to the developed condition; that such increased flooding produced by the
development of real property contributes increased quantities of waterborne pollutants and
tends to increase channel erosion; that such increased flooding, increased erosion, and
increased pollution constitutes deterioration of the water resources of the municipality, the
county and the State; and that such increased flooding, increased erosion and increased
pollution can be controlled by the regulation of storm water runoff from such development.
It is therefore determined that it is in the public interest to regulate the development of real
property and to establish standards to regulate the discharge of storm water runoff from such
developments as provided in this Ordinance.
B. Storm Water Management Goals. Storm water management plans submitted pursuant to
Article VIII shall demonstrate careful consideration of the general and specific concerns,
values and standards of the municipal master plan and applicable county and State storm
drainage control programs, and any county mosquito commission control standards, and
shall be based on environmentally sound site planning, engineering and landscape
architectural techniques. The design of all stormwater management facilities shall address
water quality, flooding and groundwater recharge and shall incorporate the use of nonstructural
stormwater management strategies to the maximum extent practical. Land subject
to periodic or occasional flooding (flood plain hazard areas) shall not be developed in such a
way to endanger life or property or aggravate the potential for flooding. Such land shall be
reserved for open space or other similar uses. (See also §427.)
C. Best Available Technology (BAT) Required. Development shall use the best available
technology to minimize off-site storm water runoff, increase on-site infiltration, simulate
natural drainage systems, and minimize off-site discharge of pollutants to ground and surface
water and encourage natural filtration functions. Best available technology may include
measures such as extended detention basins, infiltration basins, contour terraces and swales.
D. Lot Grading. Lots shall be graded to secure proper drainage away from buildings and into
streets. Additionally, drainage shall be provided in a manner which will prevent the
collection of storm water in pools or other unauthorized concentrations of flow, and water
shall not flow across adjacent property lines unless specifically approved by the Municipal
Engineer. The Municipal Engineer may direct the installation of a piped under drain system
and soil stabilization fabric within roadways, drives and parking lots if deemed necessary.
[Ord. 1810-04, 9/21/2004]
1. Grading in lawn areas shall meet the following minimum standards:
a. Provide a minimum of 6 inch drop in the first 20 feet from a building.
b. Overland grades throughout the site shall be a minimum of 2%.
c. Grades for swales shall be a minimum of 1%
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §522
202
d. Maximum slopes on residential lots shall be 5:1 (horizontal: vertical) except
where approved by the Municipal Engineer.
2. All work shall be in accordance with the established design standards of the
municipality and as required by the Municipal Engineer.
E. Storm Water System Strategy and Design.
1. Intent. The system shall be adequate to carry off or store the storm water and
natural drainage water which originates not only within the lot or tract boundaries,
but also that which originates upstream of the lot or tract boundaries and normally
flows through the tract. Storm water run-off, natural drainage water or water
discharged from any source shall not be so diverted as to overload the existing
drainage systems or create flooding or the need for additional drainage structures on
other private properties or public lands without proper and approved provisions
being made for managing these conditions.
2. Prohibited Design. Over the sidewalk, under the sidewalk and/or through the curb
drains for the purpose of routing the discharge from sump pumps is prohibited.
These facilities must outlet into an adequate water course or drainage system as
approved by the Municipal Engineer. Roof leaders must be connected to an
approved drainage system as approved by the Municipal Engineer. In the absence of
a practical outlet for either sump pump or roof leaders, other systems, such as
drywells, as approved by the Municipal Engineer may be used. Drywells shall be
setback from all property lines a minimum of 10 feet.
3. Stormwater runoff calculations. Techniques and designs for computing storm water
runoff shall be in accordance with N.J.A.C. 7:8-5 and N.JA.C. 5:21.
4. Soil testing is required for all proposed infiltration basins and drywells. Testing
shall be witnessed by the Municipal Engineer, unless such requirement is waived.
5. Whenever possible, all lots shall be designed to provide positive drainage to the
roadway facility fronting same without flowing onto or across adjacent property.
Where this is impractical, the disposal of storm drainage through adjacent properties
shall be through easement areas by underground piping and inlets, swales, et cetera.
The depth of standing water at the pavement gutter line shall not exceed 9 inches
for a 100-year storm event.
F. Storm Water Management Basins. [Ord. 2081-11, 2/15/11] Storm water management basins
shall be required for all tracts except as subsequently noted below and shall be designed to
provide adequate storage of storm water runoff for a 100-year storm event. Additional
requirements include:
1. Basin required. A detention basin shall be required if site improvements will
increase storm water runoff by one (1) cubic foot per second (CFS) in the 100-year
storm event.
2. Permitted basin location. All storm water management basins shall conform to the
following siting requirements.
a. Any storm water management basin in a residential zoning district shall be
located within the setbacks for a principal building on the lot. For the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §522
203
purposes of this sub-paragraph, a residential district shall also include the
PVD-1, PVD-2 and MX-1 zones. For purposes of determining compliance,
the setback shall be measured from the toe of an exterior slope of the
bermed edge of a basin or, when the edge is not bermed, the waters edge
reached in a 100-year storm event, whichever provides the greater setback.
b. In accordance with §525.H.1.c, no storm water management facility,
including basins, shall be located within a required landscape buffer.
3. Use of retaining walls. No storm water management facility shall make use of
retaining walls unless approved as part of a formal landscaping plan under subparagraph
-5 below or if located in the interior of a basin and not visible from a
public right-of-way or adjacent property (whether developed or undeveloped) from
ground level.
4. Naturalistic design required for detention. The detention area shall be graded
creatively to blend into the surrounding landscape and imitate a natural depression
with an irregular edge. Linear or geometric shapes are to be avoided unless
approved as part of a formal landscaping plan under sub-paragraph -5 below.
5. Formal design permitted for retention. The design for stormwater retention facilities
may use a variety of landscape forms, including formal reflecting pools, fountain
features, and naturalistic lakes and ponds. Retaining walls may be utilized when
essential to formal landscape designs which incorporate water features and/or
stormwater management functions.
6. Conveyance. Detention basins shall be designed to convey all runoff from the 100-
year storm event from the basin without creating adverse impacts on property.
Backwater impacts from the filling of the basin shall also be considered in the
design of the facility.
7. Detention basins shall discharge into a stable outfall structure, whether natural or
manmade. Stability calculations based on the 100-year storm outflow shall be
required showing adherence to Soil Conservation Service standards.
8. Any storm water facility approved as a part of site plan or subdivision application
shall be constructed and functioning prior to the issuance of a building permit for
construction of a building. In the event that an approved site plan includes the
renovation or adaptive reuse of an existing building, the Municipal Engineer shall
have the discretion to waive strict compliance with this sub-paragraph.
9. An agreement for the ownership and maintenance of detention facilities serving two
or more lots, with cross easements, shall be furnished to the satisfaction of the Board
of Jurisdiction.
10. Detention basins shall be constructed on individual lots (not part of a residential
building lot) in all residential subdivisions and may be constructed within an
easement in all residential minor subdivisions.
11. For development with less than one-quarter (¼) acre of new impervious surface
coverage, a deed restriction shall be established which limits the total new
impervious surface coverage to less than one-quarter (¼) acre. This impervious
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §522
204
surface coverage limitation shall be applied to the subject lot or equally distributed
between all lots within a subdivision, as deemed appropriate by the Board of
Jurisdiction.
G. Landscaping. Stormwater management areas including retention and detention basins,
drainage ditches and swales, and wetland areas shall be landscaped in accordance with the
standards in §525 and shall contain indigenous species to the maximum extent practical.
This may involve integration of these areas as aesthetic landscape features, naturalized
wetland areas, or active and passive recreation areas, in addition to their stormwater
management function. Detention and retention basins should be located in cleared areas
where reasonably feasible.
H. Detention Facility Maintenance. (See also §529.I)
1. Maintenance of the detention facility shall be the responsibility of the owner of the
property upon which the detention facility is located. The owner may be a
homeowner's organization or an open space organization established for the purpose
of owning and maintaining common lands and facilities including conservation,
open space, floodplain, drainage, recreation and park areas and shall be in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-43 and the following provisions except that, under
certain conditions, the municipality will maintain the detention facility, subject to
the conditions as defined herein. See also §529 for provisions concerning the
establishment of homeowners' associations for open space.
2. Membership in any homeowners or created open space organization by all property
owners shall be mandatory. Such required membership in any such organization
and the responsibilities upon the members shall be in writing between the
organization and the individual in the form of a covenant with each member
accepting liability for a pro rata share of the organization's costs and providing that
the municipality shall be a party beneficiary to such covenant entitled to enforce its
provisions. The terms and conditions of said covenant shall be reviewed by the
planning board attorney prior to final approval.
3. Executed deeds shall be tendered to the municipality simultaneously with the
granting of final approval stating that the prescribed use(s) of the lands in the
common ownership shall be absolute and not subject to revision for possible future
development.
4. The homeowners or open space organization shall be responsible for liability
insurance, municipal taxes, maintenance of land and facilities and inspection and
certification of facilities that may be erected on any land deeded to such
organization and shall hold the municipality harmless from any liability.
5. Any assessment levied by the homeowners or open space organization may become
a lien on the private properties in the development. The duly created organization
shall be allowed to adjust the assessment to meet changing needs and any deeded
lands may only be sold, donated or in some other way conveyed to the municipality
for public purposes only.
6. The homeowners or open space organization initially created by the developer shall
clearly describe in its bylaws the rights and obligations of any homeowner and
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §522
205
tenant in the planned development, along with the covenant and model deeds and the
articles of incorporation of the association prior to the granting of final approval by
the municipality.
7. Part of the development proposals submitted to and approved by the municipality
shall be provisions to insure that control of the homeowners or open space
organization will be transferred to the individual lot owners in the development
based on a percentage of the dwelling units sold and/or occupied, together with
assurances in the bylaws that the organization shall have the maintenance
responsibilities for all lands to which they hold title.
8. Should the proposed development consist of stages, the Board may require that
acreage proportionate in size to the stage being considered for final approval be set
aside simultaneously with granting of final approval for that particular stage, even
though these lands may be located in a different section of the overall development.
9. In the event that the detention facility becomes a danger to public safety or public
health, or if it is in need of maintenance, the municipality shall so notify in writing
the responsible person. From that notice, the responsible person shall have 14 days
to affect such maintenance and repair of the facility in a manner that is approved by
the Municipal Engineer or his designee. If the responsible person fails or refuses to
perform such maintenance and repair, the municipality may immediately proceed to
do so and shall bill the cost thereof to the responsible person.
10. In certain situations, the municipality's governing body may accept the ownership
and maintenance responsibilities of detention facilities subject to conditions
including but not limited to the following:
a. Where the only facility requiring homeowners organization maintenance is
the detention basin, the governing body may consider assuming ownership
and maintenance responsibilities upon agreement with the developer to pay
the pro-rata share of the cost to maintain the detention facility at the time of
the granting of a certificate of occupancy. The pro-rata share of cost shall
be the total estimated cost of such maintenance including insurance,
inspections, and certifications as required by State and local rules and
regulations in accordance with a formula on file with and calculated by the
Municipal Engineer.
I. Easement Requirements. See also §527, Land Use Restrictions.
1. Where required by the municipality, if a lot or tract is traversed by a watercourse,
surface or underground drainage way or drainage system, channel, stream or
drainage swale, there shall be provided and dedicated a drainage right-of-way
easement to the municipality or other owners of private underground drainage
system conforming substantially with the lines of such watercourse or drainage
system and of such width or construction or both as will be adequate to
accommodate expected storm water runoff in the future, based upon reasonable
growth potential in the municipality and in any event, meeting any minimum widths
and locations shown on any adopted Official Map or Master Plan. Such easement
dedication shall be expressed on the plat as follows: Drainage easement granted to
for the purposes provided for and expressed in the Land Use Ordinance of the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §522
206
Township.
2. No structures, trees, shrubs or obstacles of any kind shall be installed within the
limits of the drainage easements and such prohibition shall be recorded as such in
the easement deeds. Fences may be constructed in drainage easements under
Lawrence Township jurisdiction if the following conditions are met:
a. Fence must cross easement at 90º angle.

running perpendicular from the long axis of the buildable area will point within 30º
of true south. To accommodate the orientation of buildable areas of lots in
accordance with this section, the majority of streets should, within the limits of
practicability and feasibility, be oriented along an east west axis, with maximum
deviations of 30º from true east.
2. Lot arrangement. The lot arrangement shall be such that the buildable area for each
lot will be situated so that homes built to the height permitted by Article IV will not
interfere with the availability of direct sunlight to the south sides of buildable areas
on adjacent lots in the subdivision between 9:00 a.m. and 3:00 p.m. Eastern
Standard Time on December 21.
3. Waiver provisions. Upon request of the applicant, the Planning Board may grant
relief from any of the requirements of this section to the minimum extent necessary
if the Board finds that compliance with any of these sections is not practicable or
feasible. Practicability and feasibility may be affected by, but not limited to, any of
the following factors:
a. Natural constraints, such as steep slopes, wetlands, flood plains, unsuitable
soils, rock formations, and wooded areas;
b. Manmade constraints such as existing streets and utility infrastructures;
c. Reduction in density below the density permitted in the zoning ordinance;
and
d. Conflict with other land development standards.
Land Use Ordinance

§ 524 Fences and Walls.
The following provisions shall apply to fences and walls in non-residential districts (see §429.G for
residential standards):
A. Height. Fences shall be limited to 8 feet in height. Walls shall be limited to 6 feet in height.
B. Landscape Plan. Fencing and walls for all uses requiring site plan approval shall be
considered within the overall context of a landscape plan that considers the function and
aesthetic quality of the fencing or wall.
C. Finished Side. All permitted fences shall be situated on a lot in such a manner that the
finished or non-structural side shall face abutting properties.
D. Prohibited Types. No fence or wall shall be erected of barbed wire, topped with metal
spikes, broken bottles and glass, nor constructed of any material or in any manner which may
be dangerous to persons or animals, except that the provisions applicable to animals shall not
apply to farms.
E. Stormwater Flow. Fences and walls shall be erected to avoid damming or diverting the
natural flow of water or shall be integrated into a grading plan that provides for the adequate
movement of storm water.
F. Limitations on Chain Link. Chain link fences shall only be permitted in conjunction with
manufacturing or warehousing operations, recreational facilities, and institutional uses.
Landscaping may be required in conjunction with such fencing.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §525
211
§ 525 Landscaping.
A. General Provisions. The following general provisions shall apply to the installation and
design of landscapes:
1. All land areas not covered with buildings, parking, or other impervious surfaces
shall be landscaped with suitable materials. Landscaping shall consist of trees,
shrubs, ground cover, perennials, and annuals singly or in common as well as other
inanimate materials such as rocks, water, sculpture, art, walls, fences, and paving
materials.
2. A landscape design shall be provided as part of site plan and subdivision
submissions in accordance with Article VIII. Every applicant for subdivision or site
plan approval shall comply with the minimum standards as set forth in this section.
3. The Board of Jurisdiction may require additional landscaping to create an
appropriate landscaping scheme for the site given the nature of the site and the
proposed development.
4. Where subdivisions only are applied for, the minimum standards shall apply only to
street trees and to common open space and areas proposed to be dedicated to the
public.
5. All landscape plants shall be typical in size and weight for their species and shall
conform to the standards of the American Association of Nurserymen for quality
and installation.
6. Plants with pervasive root systems shall not be located where they may cause
damage to drainage pipes or other underground utilities and storm water
management facilities and should generally be no closer than 10 feet measured
horizontally.
7. All plants shall be tolerant of specific site conditions. The use of indigenous species
is strongly encouraged. Exotic, non-native invasive plant species shall not be
permitted.
8. Visual screening is required to buffer all trash enclosures, above ground propane
tanks and other similar structures as identified by the Zoning Officer. [Ord.1585-99,
9/7/1999]
B. Landscape Design Guidelines.
1. Landscaping shall be conceived holistically and be designed to achieve a thorough
integration of the various elements of site design, including building and parking
placement, the natural features of the site and the preservation of pleasing or
aesthetic views. Landscaping shall be used to accent and complement the form and
type of building proposed.
2. In the landscape design of sites, areas shall be designated for retaining existing trees
and the replacement of trees cleared from the site in accordance with §541.
3. Landscaping shall be located to provide effective climatic control. The east and
west walls of a building should be the most heavily vegetated to shade for summer
sun and the north to northwest area for winter prevailing winds. The southerly
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §525
212
facing side of a building should be shaded from summer sun but open for solar gain
during the winter.
4. Plant's susceptibility to disease, their colors, textures, shapes, blossoms, and foliage
characteristics shall be considered in the overall design of a landscape plan.
5. Local soil conditions and water availability shall be considered in the choice of
landscaping.
6. In the design process, the eventual maturity of the plant shall be considered for its
effect on circulation patterns, solar access, site lighting, drainage, emergency access
and relationship to buildings and the streetscape.
C. Street Trees.
1. Location. Street trees shall be installed on both sides of all streets in accordance
with an approved landscape plan. Trees shall be spaced evenly along the street
between the curb and sidewalk. Where the distance between the curb and sidewalk
is less than 5 feet, sidewalks should be placed in a public access easement outside of
the right-of-way to create a planting strip at least 5 feet wide to facilitate street tree
growth. In commercial areas with wider sidewalks that extend to the curb, trees
shall be placed in tree wells with root guard systems. Such tree wells shall have
sufficient soil volume to support tree growth as follows:
Tree Size at Maturity Soil Volume
(Height in feet) (in cubic feet)
Large trees (45'+) 200
Medium-sized trees (30'-45') 150
Small trees (to 30') 100
Areas under sidewalks may be used to meet the soil volume requirement provided
no more than 50% of the volume is located under such hard paving.
2. Spacing. When trees are planted at predetermined intervals along streets, spacing
shall depend on tree size.
Tree Size at Maturity Planting Interval
(Height in fee) (in feet)
Large trees (45'+) 40
Medium-sized trees (30'-45') 30
Small trees (to 30') 20
Trees may be planted closer together in order to avoid interference with utilities,
roadways, sidewalks, sight easements, and street lights.
3. Street tree type. Tree type may vary depending on overall effect desired but as a
general rule, all trees shall be large deciduous trees except as needed to achieve
special effects. Tree selection shall be approved by the Board in accordance with
Tables 5.4, 5.5 and 5.6. Alternate selections may be approved at the discretion of
the Board.

Lawrence Township, Mercer County §525
224
view from the street, supplemental shade tolerant plantings of shrubs,
evergreen and ornamental trees shall be installed to complete screening of
residences. Sidewalks shall be designed to avoid mature plantings even if a
public access easement is necessary.
I. Cul-de-Sacs. Where a homeowner's or condominium association is established or intended
to be established for the maintenance of common open space or storm water management
basins, vegetated islands in the center of cul-de-sacs should be proposed that exhibit the
following criteria:
1. All plant material shall be designed for a mature height under 30 inches (2.5 feet) or
above 7 feet in order to allow for proper visibility.
2. All plants shall be tolerant of drought, salt and reflected heat from pavement.
3. Ground cover plantings shall be consistent with the degree of maintenance expected
for the cul-de-sacs and of sufficient density to entirely cover the ground surface.
J. Stormwater Facilities. Stormwater management areas including retention and detention
basins, drainage ditches and swales, and wetland areas shall be landscaped in accordance
with the standards in this subsection. The screening of outfall structures and emergency
spillways from public view is of particular importance in the landscape design. This may
involve integration of these areas as aesthetic landscape features, naturalized wetland areas,
or active and passive recreation areas, in addition to their stormwater management function.
Detention and retention basins should be located in cleared areas where reasonably feasible.
1. Stormwater detention facility landscaping.
a. Interior tree planting. [Ord. 1585-99, 9/7/1999]
(1) Basins designed as naturalized wetland areas shall be planted with
a quantity of trees equal to the number necessary to cover the entire
area of the interior of the basin to the emergency spillway elevation
at a rate of one tree per 400 square feet. Notwithstanding the
minimum planting size as otherwise required in this section, of this
number 10% shall be 2 2.5 caliper, 20% shall be 1.5 to 2
caliper, and 70% shall be 6-8 height whips. The trees shall be
planted in groves and spaced 5 feet to 15 feet on-center.
(2) Basins designed to function as dry basins shall be planted with trees
in areas of the interior of the basin where there will not be
interference with the maintenance of the basin and low flow
channel, as determined by the Municipal Engineer.
b. The ground should be seeded with a wildflower or wet meadow grass mix
but in certain circumstances may require sod or hydroseeding to stabilize
the basin slopes.
c. All plants shall be tolerant of typical flood plain and wetland conditions.
See Table 5.8 for recommended wet conditions plants.
d. Planting other than wildflowers and grasses shall not be located within 10
feet of low flow channels to facilitate drainage.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §525
225
e. The perimeter area (slopes above the high water line) shall include shade
trees at a rate of 60/1000 lineal feet, evergreen trees at a rate of 30/1000
lineal feet and sufficient ornamental trees and shrubs to screen drainage
structures and create visual interest. Trees should be grouped in concert
with the grouping of trees in the interior of the basin
f. Where basins are required to be located in existing wooded areas because of
existing topological constraints, islands of existing vegetation should be
retained. If the existing vegetation is retained, the new plantings
requirement shall be correspondingly reduced.
g. Provisions for emergency access as well as general maintenance of the
basins shall be reviewed by the Board of Jurisdiction. Plantings shall be
designed to disguise yet not hinder vehicular access.
h. Plantings shall not be permitted upon any berm associated with a detention
basin unless approved by the Municipal Engineer.
2. Stormwater retention facility landscaping.
a. The planting of the perimeter of the water's edge shall accentuate views of
the water and to the extent feasible integrate pedestrian paths, sitting areas,
and other passive recreational uses. Plantings shall include formal or
informally-massed deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs to screen and
frame views with ornamental trees, shrubs and grasses used for visual
interest or special effects. A continuous landscape area shall be provided.
b. The waters edge shall be easily maintained and shall be stabilized.
Methods of providing water edge stabilization may include rip-rap, stone
walls, natural plantings, decking and bulkheads.
c. If retention facilities are used as a recreational amenity, pedestrian access to
the water shall be controlled.
3. All basin structures shall be designed to blend into the landscape in terms of
construction materials, color, grading and planting.
K. Open Space Landscaping. (See also §529). Common or public open space provided as a part
of any cluster development shall be landscaped in one of the following ways, depending
upon the intent of the use for the open space.
1. Conservation use. Conservation areas are appropriate in areas adjacent to and
inclusive of natural features to be preserved, including wooded areas, water bodies,
streams wetlands, and steep slopes. The following conservation use design
guidelines shall apply:
a. Natural features shall be encompassed in open space areas rather than
moved or eliminated in the development process.
b. Cleared areas shall be revegetated to a naturalistic appearance where
appropriate.
c. Revegetated areas may be seeded with a wildflower and/or meadow grass
mix.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §525
226
2. Recreational Open Space. The following landscape standards shall apply for
recreational uses:
a. Grading and plantings of the recreation area shall remain consistent with the
overall landscape design. The landscape design shall consist of massed
deciduous and evergreen trees and berms to create spaces and views and
ornamental trees and shrub masses for visual variety, interest and detail.
b. In general, plants shall be provided at the following rates:
(1) Shade trees - 15 per acre
(2) Evergreen Trees - 5 per acre
(3) Flowering Shrubs - 3 per acre
(4) Shrubs - 20 per acre
These quantities are exclusive of plants that may be required for landscape
buffers pursuant to §525.H.
c. Adjacent dwelling units shall be buffered from active play areas in
accordance with §525.H.
d. In the area where a recreation facility fronts onto a public or private street,
fencing may be required to provide controlled access. The adjacent street
tree planting shall be continued along this area, and any reverse frontage
buffer planting shall be integrated with open space plantings.
L. Parking and Loading Area Landscaping. The objectives of the landscape architectural
treatment of all parking areas shall be to provide for safe and convenient movement of
vehicles, to limit pedestrian/vehicular conflicts, to limit paved areas, to provide for screening
from public right-of-way and buildings, to reduce the overall visual impact of parking lots,
and to provide shade and reduce heat island effects. All non-residential parking lots and
residential parking lots in excess of 5 spaces shall conform to the following requirements:
1. The minimum width of landscape islands shall be 8 feet on the side of parking
spaces and 10 feet between parking bays. If sidewalks are incorporated through the
long axis of the landscape islands, their width shall be added to these requirements.
Where the parking lot design will result in pedestrians cutting perpendicularly
through landscape islands, sidewalks shall be installed at regular intervals through
its short axis.
2. Landscape islands shall be planted with a combination of deciduous trees, evergreen
and deciduous shrubs, and ground cover at the rate of 6 large or medium trees, 4
small or ornamental trees and 60 shrubs per 100 lineal feet along the long axis of the
island. Trees required to be replaced from site clearing pursuant to §541 may be
placed in such landscape islands.
3. Parking and loading areas shall be screened by a combination of berms, hedges,
fences or walls. The minimum screening height at planting shall be 3 feet and shall
have a height of at least 4 feet within three years of installation. Loading dock areas
shall be screened with a minimum height of 8 feet at planting and shall achieve a
height of at least 12 feet five years after installation. Land use mitigation buffers
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §525
227
pursuant to §525.H may be used to meet these requirements.
4. Parking lot lighting should be sited within landscape islands, however, without
hindering necessary lighting coverage. See also §527 for lighting requirements.
5. No more than 20 parking spaces shall be placed in one row of parking without an
intervening landscape island except that within a regional shopping mall rows of
more than 20 parking spaces may meet the intent of this requirement by increasing
the size of landscaped islands at the end of parking bays and/or by other landscape
features which provide a comparable benefit to that of the landscaped islands which
would otherwise be required. [Ord. 1941-07, 9/4/07]
M. Historic District Landscaping. The objectives of landscape architectural treatment of sites
inclusive of historic resources and natural amenities shall be to preserve and enhance such
amenities for present and future Lawrence residents. Historic resources and natural
amenities may be areas of unique landscape character. This may include, but is not limited
to, bodies of water, streams, wetlands, wind breaks, groves of trees, hedge rows, orchards,
unique vistas, historic structures and landmarks. Redevelopment in the Lawrenceville
Historic District shall be designed to preserve and utilize cultural resources of the historic
landscape.
N. Site Protection and General Planting Requirements.
1. Topsoil preservation. Topsoil moved during the course of construction shall be
redistributed on all regraded surfaces so as to provide at least 4 inches of even cover
to all disturbed areas of the development and shall be stabilized by seeding or
planting.
2. Removal of debris. All stumps and other tree parts, litter, brush, weeds, excess or
scrap building materials, or other debris shall be removed from the site and disposed
of in accordance with New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection
regulations. No tree stumps, portions of tree trunks or limbs shall be buried
anywhere in the development. All dead or dying trees, standing or fallen, shall be
removed from the site. If trees and limbs are reduced to chips, they may, subject to
approval of the Municipal Engineer, be used as mulch in landscaped areas, provided
they have been properly composted.
3. Protection of existing plantings. Maximum effort should be made to save specimen
plants. No material or temporary soil deposits shall be placed within 4 feet of shrubs
or 10 feet of trees designated to be retained on the preliminary and/or final plat. See
Lawrence Township Engineering Standards for details on tree wells and tree
protection.
4. Slope plantings. Landscaping of the area of all cuts and fills and/or terraces shall be
sufficient to prevent erosion, and all roadway slopes steeper than 3:1 shall be planted
with ground covers appropriate for the purpose and soil conditions, water
availability, and environment.
5. Additional landscaping. In residential developments, besides the screening and
street trees required, additional plantings or landscaping elements shall be required
throughout the subdivision where necessary for climate control, privacy, or for
aesthetic reasons in accordance with a typical planting plan approved by the Board.

superseded.
4. Exterior lighting not building mounted shall be supplied by electricity from
underground cabling.
B. Street Lighting. All public and private streets shall be sufficiently illuminated to ensure
traffic and pedestrian safety under all weather conditions.
1. Design criteria. The design of street lighting shall take into consideration:
a. The brightness of the abutting uses in comparison to pavement brightness as
seen by both motorists and pedestrians;
b. The ability to discern objects on the street or its edge in comparison to
abutting uses; its brightness contrast;
c. The time available to the motorist and pedestrian to view such objects;
d. The amount of direct glare from the luminaire or lamp and reflected glare
from the pavement.
2. Lighting standard placement. Excepting rural roads and lanes, lighting standards
shall be located at the following places:

A. Design Guidelines for Parks and Recreation Areas.
1. Consultation with the Township's Recreation Department early in the site plan and
subdivision design process is encouraged where active recreation is proposed or
required.
2. Proposed recreation areas should complement nearby existing facilities rather than
duplicating them.
3. Land proposed for field sports should have positive drainage and have a natural
grade of no more than 5%. The soil should not have a high clay content or be
excessively stony.
4. Extensions of existing parks and recreation areas into new development are highly
encouraged.
B. Design Objectives for Parks and Recreation Areas. The design of parks and recreation areas
shall achieve the following objectives:
1. Satisfy the needs of the users;
2. Achieve a balance and compatibility between active and passive recreational uses;
3. Provide visual appeal;
4. Observe appropriate relationships between the various elements of the park design;
5. Adapt the land to the features of the terrain rather than altering the land to suit the
use;
6. Provide for ease of supervision;
7. Design with regard for solar orientation and prevailing winds;
8. Incorporate the goals and objectives of the Master Plan with particular regard for the
Greenway Network;
9. Ensure protection of environmentally sensitive areas; and
10. Provide safety for users.
C. Area Requirements for Open Space. The minimum land area for inclusion in an open space
calculation shall be no less than 10,000 contiguous square feet. If the land is proposed for
public dedication, the land area shall be no less than one acre.

more of Gross Leasable Area (GLA), one of the following two alternative parking standards
shall apply [Ord.1941-07, 9/4/07]:
1. Alternative 1: 4.5 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of GLA;
2. Alternative 2: 4.3 parking spaces per 1,000 square feet of GLA along with the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §530
246
preparation and implementation of a Parking Management Plan.
3. The selection of Alternative 1 or 2 shall be at the applicants discretion. Under
Alternative 1 no Parking Management Plan is required. Under Alternative 2 the
Applicant is required to submit  as part of an application for Preliminary Site Plan
approval for a project under this section  a Parking Management Plan which will
set forth the Applicants plan to monitor parking utilization during the peak
utilization period between Thanksgiving and Christmas after substantial completion
of construction and determine whether the supply of parking is adequate for the 20th
highest peak demand hour during the year. Parking demand shall be monitored and
evaluated utilizing the following protocol (or a substitute protocol approved by the
Planning Board):
a. Conduct a base parking count at the Mall to determine the total number of
vehicles parked at specific times (10:00 AM on Friday and Saturday; 12
noon on Sunday);
b. Conduct manual traffic counts at 15-minute intervals from 10:00 AM to
6:00 PM on the Friday after Thanksgiving and the two Saturdays before
Christmas and from 12 noon to 6:00 PM on any Sunday between
Thanksgiving and Christmas at each Mall Driveway to capture the total
amount of entering and exiting vehicles.
c. Based upon the difference in entering and exiting volumes in each 15-
minute interval, onsite parking accumulation will be determined (see
example table below).
Parking Accumulation Survey
Time Period Enter Exit Difference Parking Demand
Base Parking Count
(10:00 AM) - - - 400 spaces
10:00 AM  10:15 AM 150 100 +50 450 spaces
10:15 AM  10:30 AM 175 110 +65 515 spaces
10:30 AM  10:45 AM 225 115 +110 625 spaces
4. Utilizing the observed peak parking demand, determine a peak parking demand
index based upon the occupied GLA square footage of the Regional Shopping Mall
at the time of the survey.
5. Adjust the observed peak parking demand index to reflect the design condition (20th
highest demand hour).
6. Prepare a report for submission to Lawrence Township summarizing the findings of
the parking study. If the findings of the study indicate the 4.30 parking ratio is not
sufficient, then the Parking Management Plan shall identify how the parking
shortfall will be addressed. The Parking Management Plan shall include at least the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §530
247
following three levels of response to a finding of insufficiency of parking:
a. Prepare and implement a plan in which employees of the Regional
Shopping Mall park in designated areas which are furthest from the Mall
entrances, thus maximizing the number of conveniently located parking
spaces which are available to customers;
b. Prepare and implement a plan in which employees of the Mall businesses
park at an off-site location(s), particularly during the busiest shopping
periods (on Saturdays and Sundays between Thanksgiving and Christmas);
and
c. Prepare and implement a plan for expanding the parking supply on-site by
building additional parking (either surface lots or structured parking)
sufficient to bring the parking ratio to 4.5 parking spaces per 1,000 square
feet of GLA. The location and organization of the supplemental structured
parking shall be designated on the Preliminary and Final Site Plans for the
Mall redevelopment/expansion project.
The Parking Management Plan shall set forth the timeframe for testing the results of
the responses to a finding of insufficiency and identify the point at which the
supplemental parking will be constructed,

not less than 6 basic house designs in every housing development consisting of from
50 to 77 houses; and not less than 8 basic house designs in every housing
development consisting of 78 or more houses.
7. To insure conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance, no construction permit
shall hereafter be issued for more than one dwelling in any housing development
until the builder shall post or cause to be posted on each specific lot on the map of
the subdivision on file with the construction official, the type and model of each
house for which a construction permit has been or is being issued.
C. Townhouses. The following standards shall be used in the design of townhouse buildings:

structure shall be staggered in height by not less than 5% of the height of the roof
lines of the remaining units in such structure. The roof line should be discontinuous
through the combination of two- and three-story townhouses and two-story flats.
Chimneys, skylights, dormers, and other roof structures are encouraged to vary the
elevation and provide additional light into upper story units.
3. Where an outdoor living space is included for a unit, it shall be provided with
adequate visual screening from all other neighboring dwelling units, outdoor living
spaces, parking areas and roadways. Screening may be accomplished with plant
materials, masonry structures or wood fencing a minimum of 4 feet in height.
Architectural elements, such as masonry walls and fences, shall be compatible in
both style and materials with the dwelling unit.
D. Planned Developments. The following performance and design standards shall be used in
the creation of planned developments (excepting residential clusters):
1. The planned development shall be developed by a single entity and shall include all
contiguous or non-contiguous lands of the developer. The planned development
shall integrate all lands, buildings and related community facilities, infrastructure,
roads, transportation and open space in an architecturally complete package.
2. A comprehensive urban design concept plan shall be prepared for the entire planned
development before any plan is prepared for any section. This urban design plan
shall include the location of streets, utilities, services, building sites, described in site
plans, floor plans, building elevations, site sections, and other graphic
representations, including perspectives, models, etc., deemed necessary to show the
relationship of buildings, open spaces, streetscapes and parks, as intended to be
located, constructed, used and related to each other.
3. A comprehensive urban design plan for the planned development shall be developed
to include proposed materials, colors, streetscape elements, textures, facade
modulation, roof lines, landscaping, and lighting.
4. Generally, grid and modified grid street patterns that create civic plazas or parks as
the focal points of streets shall be favored over curvilinear patterns.

and aesthetically to the urban design plan for the entire development and contain
sufficient information to show the relationship of buildings, open spaces,
streetscapes and parks, as intended to be located, constructed, and used compared to
the approved urban design plan.
6. A program shall be provided for open space, parks, and community facilities
including operation and maintenance of such areas, facilities and improvements as
will be for common use by some or all of the occupants of or visitors to the district
but will not be provided, operated or maintained at general public expense, except as
may be deemed appropriate by the approving agency and accepted by the governing
body.

§ 535 Signs
[Ord. 2072-10, 12/21/10]
A. Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to encourage the effective use of signs as a
means of communication, to maintain the aesthetic environment and the Township's ability
to attract economic development and growth, to protect and improve pedestrian and
vehicular safety, to minimize the potential adverse effects of signs on nearby public and
private property, to protect the expressive rights of all persons within the scope of applicable
law and to enable the fair and consistent application of the regulations contained herein.
Within this Chapter, paragraphs -M through T, inclusive, apply to signs containing
commercial speech, only, and not to non-commercial speech.
B. Performance. Signs shall be permitted as accessory uses in all zoning districts within the
jurisdiction of this Ordinance. Signs may be used, erected, maintained, altered, relocated,
removed, or demolished only in compliance with the provisions of this section and any and
all other ordinances and regulations of the municipality relating to the use, erection,
maintenance, alteration, moving, or removal of signs or similar devices. In the event of
conflicting regulations, the most restrictive shall apply.
C. Sign Permit. A sign permit shall be required for the installation or alteration of all signs,
unless exempted from such requirements under §535.G of this section, in accordance with
the following requirements:
1. Application requirements. All applications for sign permits shall be made to the
Administrative Officer on forms provided by the municipality. All applications
shall be signed by the owner of the sign and the property owner on whose premises
the sign is to be erected. All applications shall contain a sketch of the proposed sign,
drawn to scale, the wording or message and, where the sign will be attached to a
building, a plot plan showing the location of the proposed sign with dimensions to
the nearest building and lot lines. A color photograph, no smaller than 3" x 5" or
larger than 8" x 10" shall be submitted for each existing sign on the premises.
Applications for freestanding signs over 15 feet in height or 50 square feet in area
shall be accompanied by structural plans prepared by an individual duly licensed by
the State of New Jersey. All applications shall be accompanied by the appropriate
fee. Any fee for an electrical inspection shall be in addition to the fee provided for
in the sign permit. As soon as the sign has been erected, the applicant shall notify
the construction code official for a final inspection.
2. Change of copy. After a sign permit has been obtained, the copy, wording or
pictures may be changed without the necessity of obtaining a new permit or paying
any additional fees, as long as the new copy, wording or picture comply with the
provisions of this section. Any change in the size or shape of a sign or structural
alteration shall require a new sign permit.
3. Sign permit invalidation. Any of the following shall cause a sign permit to be
invalidated: [Ord. 2199-14, 10/7/14]
a. An invalidation of a Certificate of Occupancy for the use to which the sign
relates.
b. An invalidation of any permit issued for a sign by another agency or level of
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §535
258
government or the loss of any license held precedent to receiving such
permit.
c. An alteration in the area of a sign, the shape of a sign or structure of the sign
support.

e. Abandonment pursuant to §535.C.5 of this section.
4. Effect of invalidation. For a period of not more than six months, a sign may
continue to be displayed once its permit has become invalid provided the property is
being actively marketed for a new owner or tenant. In any other instance, the sign
shall be removed within 30 days of the permit invalidation. Internally illuminated
box signs shall be considered to meet the requirement for removal if the message is
turned to face the interior of the box. At no time shall the lighting elements of the
sign box be visible to passersby. It shall constitute a violation of this Ordinance for
each and every day that a sign with an expired permit is displayed. In addition to the
remedies stated above, signs which continue to be displayed in violation of this
Ordinance shall be subject to removal and the owner shall be liable for the full costs
of such removal and disposal.
5. Abandonment. If a sign advertises a business, service, commodity, accommodation,
attraction, or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or being offered
or conducted for a period of time greater than six months, that sign shall be
considered abandoned and shall, within 30 days after such abandonment, be
completely removed by the sign owner, owner of the property where the sign is
located, or other party having control over such sign. In this context, a seasonal
business such as a farm stand shall be considered operational even though closed for
a period not to exceed nine months.
D. Maintenance. All signs and displays shall be maintained in good order with periodic
painting, repairs and cleaning. In the event that the Zoning Officer of the municipality
determines that any sign has fallen into a state of disrepair, has become dilapidated or
constitutes a safety hazard, the sign owner and property owner shall be given written notice
to correct the condition within 20 days from the date of the mailing of the notice. Failure to
correct the condition or file an appeal within the time provided shall constitute a violation of
this Ordinance. The Township shall have the right to recover from said owner the full costs
of the removal and disposal of such signs should the owner fail to heed such correction
notice. Signs shall conform to the requirements of the Uniform Construction Code and any
other property maintenance code of the municipality.
E. General Provisions.
1. Corporate franchise signs. Signs identifying franchise operations or corporation
logos shall conform to the criteria for all other signs.
2. Items of information. Permanent freestanding signs and façade signs closer than 75
feet to the right-of-way of a principal arterial, secondary arterial or collector road as
indicated on the Circulation Map of the Master Plan shall not contain more than 9
items of information.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §535
259
3. Official sign imitation. No sign shall be erected that is of such character, form,
shape or color that it imitates or resembles any official traffic sign, signal or device,
when placed in a location or setting ordinarily used to give official vehicular
directional information and is likely to confuse motorists. Viewpoint signs
characterized by parody content under §535.K.3 are exempted from this restriction.
4. Permitted uses. No sign shall be erected containing a message that states or implies
that a property may be used for any purpose not permitted in the zoning district or
by duly authorized variance in which said sign is located under the provisions of this
Ordinance.
5. Prohibited placement. No sign shall be placed on any tree, telegraph, electric light,
or public utility pole, or upon rocks or other natural features, or within a public
right-of-way, except as permitted in sub-paragraph -6, below. Signs placed illegally
in such locations shall be subject to removal by the municipality.
6. Public property and rights-of-way. Any sign installed or placed on public property,
except in conformance with the requirements of this section, shall be forfeited to the
public and subject to removal. In addition to other remedies that may be imposed
under this Ordinance, the municipality shall have the right to recover from the owner
or person placing such sign the full costs of removal and disposal of such sign. No
sign other than traffic control or similar official governmental signs shall be erected
within or project over the right-of-way of any public street or sidewalk, except as
hereinafter provided. Any sign located along the right-of-way of a State or Federal
highway shall comply with any more restrictive requirements of the State and
Federal government.
7. Relief and sign face distance. Excepting viewpoint signs under §535.K.3, no sign
shall contain characters or graphics exceeding 3 inches in relief from the sign face.
No façade sign shall project more than 12 inches from the plane of the attaching
surface. The maximum distance between the faces of a double-faced sign shall not
exceed 18 inches; otherwise it shall be considered two signs and any V-shaped
sign, regardless of the separation dimension of the faces, shall be considered two
signs. [Ord. 2199-14, 10/7/14]
8. Setback and separation distance. Except where a greater setback is required, no
freestanding sign or any part thereof shall be located closer than 10 feet to any lot
line, excepting viewpoint signs under §535.K.3 if the lot dimensions would
otherwise preclude an owner or tenants ability to erect such a sign. Any new
commercial sign shall be not less than a distance of 100 feet from any existing
adjacent freestanding sign, excepting commercial properties within 200 feet or less
of frontage from which direct vehicular access is obtained, directional and directory
signs. Any off-site commercial sign, where permitted, shall be separated from any
other off-site commercial sign by a distance of not less than 1,000 feet in any
direction. Any off-site commercial variable message sign, where permitted, shall be
separated from any other commercial variable message sign by a distance of not less

traffic speeds, volumes and vehicle usage on the roadway and shall be designed to
be bicycle compatible. The Municipal Engineer shall provide the Board of
Jurisdiction with a recommendation during the application process as to the
appropriate shoulder design for the development in question.
J. Roadway Excavation. Roadway excavation shall include the removal and satisfactory
disposal of all materials taken from within the limits of the work that are necessary for the
construction and preparation of the roadbed, embankment, subgrade, shoulders, slopes, side
ditches, drainage structures, trenches, waterways, intersections, approaches, and private
entrances, as indicated or directed. All suitable materials removed from the excavations shall
be used as far as practicable in the formation of the embankment, subgrade and shoulders,
and at such other places as directed. Ditches and waterways shall be excavated to the depth
and width shown on plans, or as may be indicated or directed by the Municipal Engineer.
During construction of the roadway the roadbed shall be maintained in such condition that it
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §539
293
will be well drained at all times. After construction, the road shall be restored and repaved to
the satisfaction of the Municipal Engineer.
1. Embankments. Embankments shall be formed of suitable material placed in
successive layers of not more than 12 inches in depth for the full width of the crosssection
commencing on a subgrade approved by the Municipal Engineer, and shall
be compacted by approved mechanical equipment and by distributing the necessary
hauling uniformly over each succeeding layer. Stumps, trees, rubbish, and/or other
unsuitable material or substances shall not be placed in the embankments, nor shall
the embankment be commenced on soft or organic-laden soil.
2. Borrow excavation. When embankment from off-site is required, sufficient suitable
material shall be obtained by the subdivider from borrow pits located beyond the
limits of the work. This material shall be shown as ?borrow? and shall be of a
quality satisfactory for the purpose for which it is required and it shall be approved
by the Municipal Engineer. Borrow will include the furnishing, removal, placing
and satisfactory compacting of the additional material necessary to complete the
embankments, subgrade and shoulders.
3. Formation of subgrade. The bottom of excavation of the box to receive the
pavement surface shall be true to line, grade and cross-section established or
indicated on approved drawings. After all drains and drainage structures have been
installed and the subgrade has been shaped and compacted, it shall be brought to a
firm unyielding surface by rolling the entire area with an approved three wheel
power roller weighing not less than 10 tons. Any areas which are soft and yielding
or which will not compact readily when rolled or tamped shall be removed. All
loose rock or boulders found in the earth excavation shall be removed or broken off
to a depth of not more than 6 inches below the surface of the subgrade. All holes or
depressions made by the removal of material shall be filled with suitable material
and the whole surface compacted uniformly. If the surface of a present roadway
conforms approximately to the surface of the finished subgrade, it shall be scarified
or rooted to a uniform depth for the full width of the paved surface sufficient to
eliminate all depressions and irregularities and to permit uniform reshaping. When
necessary, additional approved material shall be added to bring the subgrade to the
desired elevation and cross-section, and the whole shall be rolled as previously
specified, until thoroughly compacted. Sod, roots, and other objectionable material
shall not be used in forming the subgrade.
4. Protection of subgrade. All ditches and drains shall be completed before placing any
pavement construction material. The subdivider shall protect the subgrade and keep
it drained at all times. Neither foundation nor surfacing material shall be deposited
on the subgrade until the subgrade has been checked and approved by the Municipal
Engineer.
5. Slopes. Slopes in embankment and excavation shall be formed with a slope not
steeper than one unit vertically to two units horizontally unless otherwise directed by
the Municipal Engineer.

§ 540 Subdivision Layout.
Subdivision layout shall be designed to encourage the development of the land which, through the
standards adopted in this Ordinance, provide for flexibility in planning and development and that
respect the natural character of the land, its drainage system, soil capabilities, groundwater and
aquifer recharge quality, and to include only those uses that are compatible with allowed uses in the
zoning district and existing uses on adjacent lands. Such compatibility shall be determined on the
basis of inventories of the natural features of the site, plans indicating the physical relationship
among types of uses and any natural or manmade barriers, existing or planned, between different uses
both within and adjacent to the proposed development. Subdivision plans shall be designed to meet
these goals and the following guidelines.
A. Lot Configuration. Lots shall be configured to meet the following requirements:
1. Side lot lines shall be either at right angles or radial to street lines.
2. Lots shall be regular in shape.
3. Pie slice-shaped lots are to be avoided except on a radius of less than 100 feet.
4. Each lot must front upon an approved public street.
5. Where extra width has been dedicated, or proposed for dedication or reservation, for
the widening of existing streets, lots shall begin at such new street line and all
setbacks shall be measured from such line.
6. Where there is a question as to the suitability of a lot or lots for their intended use
due to factors such as poor drainage conditions or flood conditions, soil tests or test
borings indicating the ground conditions to be inadequate for proper sewage
disposal for on-lot treatment of effluent or similar circumstances, the Board of
Jurisdiction may withhold approval of such lots. If approval is withheld, the Board
shall give reasons for such withholding on the record.
B. Blocks. Blocks shall be configured to meet the following requirements.
1. Blocks shall be wide enough for two tiers of lots and shall not be less than 200 feet
in width. This requirement shall not preclude the appropriate design of alleys
through blocks.
2. Blocks shall be designed to include no more than 24 residential lots.
3. Blocks shall generally be not less than 500 feet long nor more than 1,000 feet long.
Blocks in excess of 800 feet shall incorporate a mid-block pedestrian right-of-way at
least 20 feet wide connecting through the block. Pedestrian rights-of-way shall be
improved with sidewalk in accordance with the RSIS.
4. Pedestrian and bicycle paths conforming to Table 5.14 and the Lawrence Township
Engineering Standards shall be designed and constructed from the end of cul-de-sacs
and from loop streets to abutting or adjoining residential, collector and arterial
streets, parks, schools, retail uses, and the Greenway Network (see §529.G). The
width for combined pedestrian and bicycle paths shall be used for any length in
excess of 400 lineal feet, unless the RSIS permits a lesser width. Such path systems
shall be constructed regardless of the existence of such paths on abutting or
adjoining lands.

§ 541 Tree Removal and Tree Cutting.
A. Purpose. The purpose of this section is to control and regulate indiscriminate or excessive
removal, cutting, and destruction of trees, and to control, regulate, and prevent conditions
which cause an increase in storm water runoff, sedimentation, soil erosion, reflected heat, air
or noise pollution, or inhibit aquifer recharge. The regulations which follow are designed to
limit such adverse impacts.
B. Permit or Board Approval Required. No person directly or indirectly shall, without either
first obtaining a zoning permit or an approval in the site plan or subdivision application
process, remove or relocate to another site any tree within a tree save area; or, remove any
specimen tree regardless of location. "Removal" shall include, but not be limited to, damage
inflicted to the root system by machinery, storage of materials and soil compaction, change
of natural grade above or below the root system or around the trunk; damage inflicted on the
tree permitting fungus, pest, or other infestation; excessive pruning or thinning leading to a
failure to thrive; and paving over the root system with an impervious material within such
proximity as to be fatally harmful to the tree.
C. Exemptions. The following tree cutting and tree removal activities shall be exempt, unless it
is a specimen tree, from the provisions of this section:
1. Individual lot owners may remove up to 5 trees of 8" or more in caliper in any one
year period. There is no restriction on the number of trees removed less than 8" in
caliper. [Ord. 1585-99, 9/7/1999]
2. Any tree growing on property approved to operate as a nursery or garden center.
3. Any tree growing on property actively operated as a farm, which is removed to

4. Trees which, in the opinion of the Township, its employees or agents, constitute an
immediate threat to the health, safety or welfare of the general public.
5. Public or local utilities maintaining easements or rights-of-way in the normal course
of business.
6. Communications companies regulated by the Federal Communications Commission
maintaining communications lines and equipment.
7. Approved game management practice, as recommended by the State of New Jersey,
Department of Environmental Protection, Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife.

2. Area of tract.
3. Location upon the lot of trees or wooded area.
4. The location upon the lot where tree removal is to take place.
5. A survey of the size (8" caliper or larger), species and quantity of trees which are to
be removed. Where the area to be surveyed is greater than 10,000 square feet, a
representative wooded rectangular area 100' x 100' may be surveyed and its results
extrapolated to the remaining wooded area. A minimum of one sample plot per five
(5) acres of total wooded area identified for the tree removal project shall be
surveyed. The location of the sample plots shall be subject to the approval of the
Board engineer, who may seek recommendations from the Board's planning
consultant and/or the Township Shade Tree Advisory Committee. Notwithstanding
the above, the tree survey shall individually locate each specimen tree on the entire
site. [Ord. 1585-99, 9/7/1999]
6. A description of the type of tree removal project, that is:
a. Thinning;
b. Selective cutting;

E. Tree Protection Zone. Tree protection zones shall be established on all areas of a site
contemplated for development; or, tree removal in the absence of an application for
development. The tree protection zone shall be that area exclusive of buildings, parking,
driveways, streets, storm water management facilities including swales, and utilities plus an
additional width at the perimeter of such uses of land of 15 feet for a building and 10 feet for
all other classes to permit appropriate grading. The intent is to create an area or areas in
which trees shall be retained, planted initially, or are to be planted with replacement trees for
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
297
areas that have been cleared for site development. Special attention should be given to
placing old growth woodland into the tree protection zone. Utilities should be grouped into
common easements to maximum tree save areas as illustrated in Figure 5.1.
Figure 5.1 Schematic Tree Save Areas and Location of Utilities.
1. Trees within tree protection zones shall be grouped into tree save areas wherein
retention is required unless waived by the Board of Jurisdiction or by the
Administrative Officer, as the case may be. For permits that do not require an
application for major subdivision or major site plan, the Administrative Officer shall
determine the adequacy of the management plan. The Administrative Officer may
consult with the Environmental Resources Committee, Shade Tree Commission or
appropriate professional staff in his or her decision.
2. Tree protection zones and any tree save area within such zone for individual single
family detached lots not subject to major subdivision approval shall be delineated on
a plot plan or lot grading plan pursuant to §1202.C in order to determine compliance
with this section.
F. Standards for Tree Retention. The following standards shall apply to all trees regardless of
location:
1. Existing trees on a site contemplated for development shall be retained to the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
298
greatest feasible extent.
2. In off-street parking areas and storm water management facilities, islands of trees
shall be retained. These requirements shall not pertain to individual single family
detached and two-family dwellings.
3. No paving of any impervious nature shall be placed within the dripline of any tree,
and the grade shall be such that drainage of rainwater will water the root area
without pooling or exceeding the requirements of the species. Excess water shall be
admitted to storm sewers in the parking lot or drained by other means acceptable to
the Municipal Engineer.
4. Any live tree which is substantially damaged as a result of grading or general
construction shall be replaced with another tree. A tree shall be substantially
damaged when one-half (1/2) or more of the tree bark is destroyed below 4 feet or
the trunk is girdled.
5. Any tree used in a required planting, or to replace a damaged tree, shall have a trunk
or main stem which is at least 2.5 inches in caliper, unless the tree is used for storm
water management facility plantings, and shall meet the specifications of the
American Nurserymen's Association standards.
6. Existing trees are encouraged to be used for the required buffer zone of trees and
shrubs to be established in accordance with §525.H.
7. Trees in the area between the street line and the setback line of the building shall be
preserved to the greatest extent possible (see Figure 5.1).
8. Specimen trees shall not be removed unless diseased or constitute a hazard to the
general public.
9. No trees on public rights-of-way, parks, or public areas are to be removed by private
individuals except as approved by the Administrative Officer or other officer
designated by the governing body. The removal of trees shall not be permitted from
a Master Plan right-of-way unless trees are dead, diseased, or endanger life or
property, or a letter of approval is obtained from the governing body or
Administrative Officer. Conversely, no trees are to be planted on public rights-ofway
without express approval granted as part of a site plan or subdivision
application or by the Administrative Officer.
G. Methods of Tree Protection. All persons shall exercise due care to protect trees which are to
be retained from damage during construction. Critical root zones shall be protected by the
use of fencing located at the dripline in accordance with the Lawrence Township
Engineering Standards. The procedures in this subsection shall be observed in order to
protect retained trees, as follows:
1. Protection from mechanical injury.
a. Prior to any grubbing or clearing, all trees in the tree protection zone from
its edge to a depth of 25 feet into the zone shall be protected from
equipment damage by enclosing the area at the dripline. Individual trees to
be retained shall be completely encircled as required herein. All exposed
roots, trunks, and low lying branches shall be equally protected. Groups of
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
299
trees in a tree save area may be protected by fencing the entire area where
they are located. Compaction of the ground by mechanical, vehicular,
storage of materials, or other means within the dripline shall not be
permitted.
b. Feeder roots shall not be cut within the dripline; however, if feeder root
cutting is waived in order to further other objectives of this section, such
cuts shall be made by hand with pruning shears to produce sharp, clean cuts.
Removal of feeder roots by mechanized equipment shall not be permitted.
c. Tree trunks and exposed roots shall not be damaged. However, accidental
damage shall be addressed and action taken to avoid further injury to the
tree. Damaged branches shall be sawed off at the branch collar. No shellac
or pruning paint shall be used. When the portion of the tree that is damaged
is diseased, pruning equipment shall be dipped in alcohol to prevent further
spread of disease.
d. Deciduous trees shall be given a liquid, slow-release, low-nitrogen, allpurpose
fertilizer to aid in their recovery from potential damage from
construction activities. Such application shall be made at a distance of 1
foot from the trunk extending out in concentric circles to the dripline. The
fertilizer shall be injected into the ground at the time of the cease of
construction and one year thereafter.
e. Trees shall not be used for roping, cabling, signs, or fencing. Nails and
other fastening devices shall not be driven or attached to the tree.
f. The area in the critical root zone under the dripline shall be left open to
provide access for water and nutrients. No impervious cover, storage of
equipment, materials, debris or fill shall be allowed within this area except
as specifically approved by the Board of Jurisdiction or Administrative
Officer.
g. Trees being removed under the allowances in this section shall not be felled,
pushed, or pulled into a tree protection or tree save area.
2. Protection from grade change.
a. Increase in grade. If an increase in the grade of the land is proposed, the
applicant shall install either:
(1) A system of gravel and drains at the old soil level which opens into
a dry well built around the trunk and individually designed for the
contour of the land to provide aeration and drainage in accordance
with the Lawrence Township Engineering Standards.
(2) A retaining wall between the existing grade and higher grade to the
satisfaction of the Municipal Engineer.
b. Lowering the grade. If a lowering of the grade is proposed one of the
following methods to protect the tree shall be followed:
(1) Terracing the grade at the dripline and out from the tree in
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
300
accordance with the Lawrence Township Engineering Standards.
(2) A retaining wall between the existing grade and lower grade to the
satisfaction of the Municipal Engineer.
3. Protection from excavation. Trenches for utility lines or other similar uses shall
adhere to the following, listed in descending order of preference:
a. Trenches shall bypass the critical root area unless the approving authority
determines that no other practical alternative exists; in which case:
b. Trenches should be tunneled under the feeder roots a minimum of two feet
from existing grade, in accordance with the Lawrence Township
Engineering Standards, unless the approving authority determines that no
other practical alternative exists; in which case:
c. Trenches may be dug within the dripline of the tree, provided that the
following provisions shall be observed:
(1) Trenches shall be no closer to the trunk than half the distance to the
dripline.
(2) Roots shall be cut with sharp hand tools to reduce feeder root
damage.
(3) The trench shall be backfilled within the shortest amount of time
possible and the soil shall not be compacted.
d. Protection during cleanup.
(1) All construction debris shall be hauled to an approved landfill and
shall not be buried or burned.
(2) Snow fences, barriers or other tree protection devices shall be the
final item to be removed from the site prior to occupancy.
H. Required Tree Density and Replacement From Development.
1. Each lot for which a major site plan application and approval pursuant to Article
VIII is required shall have, after development, a minimum density of trees per acre
of the gross area of the tract. The number of trees required to achieve the minimum
density required shall be as set forth in this subsection. If a site initially lacks the
sufficient density of trees required or if site clearing reduces the tree density to
below the minimum required, the developer shall plant additional trees to meet the
minimum. These trees are termed replacement trees regardless of whether they
are for initial planting to meet minimum requirements or for replanting after site
clearing has occurred. Trees otherwise required to be planted for landscape buffer
areas or parking lots pursuant to §525, as the case may be, may be counted towards
the required tree density. The planting of replacement trees shall be required under
the following conditions:
a. To establish the minimum tree density requirements for the site;
b. Where grading occurs in the tree protection zone;
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
301
c. If areas permitted to be cleared leave no tree protection zone;
d. If no trees are present within the tree protection zone.
e. Where specimen trees outside the tree protection zone are to be removed;
f. Where trees are illegally removed or irreparably damaged during the
construction process.
2. The quantity of replacement trees shall be sufficient to produce a total Required
Tree Density (RDS) of at least 15 units per acre as described herein. Units shall be
determined based on the conversion factors in Tables 5.19, 5.20 and 5.21.
3. The spacing of replacement trees shall be compatible with areal limitations and the
characteristics of the species that are planted.
4. When the Administrative Officer or his designee has determined that areal
constraints result in an absolute inability to provide the required tree density, as
many trees as possible shall be planted on the site. The remaining balance of trees
shall be provided in the form of payment of 80% of the Uniform Unit Prices for
Bond Estimates as prepared by the Division of Engineering and shall be placed in a
shade tree account.
I. Calculations for RTD. Calculations for determining the Required Tree Density (RTD) are as
follows:
1. Step 1. Required Tree Density shall be calculated by multiplying the factor of 15 by
the gross tract area.
EXAMPLE: 2 acre site has a RTD of 30 (2 x 15 = 30)
2. Step 2. The Existing Tree Density (ETD) of the trees that are to remain within the
tree save area of the tree protection zone shall be calculated by converting the
caliper from the tree survey (see paragraph -D.4 and -D.6 above) to tree density
units as indicated in Table 5.19.
EXAMPLE: The tree survey identifies 15 trees that will remain on the site in the
Step 1 example after development, as follows:
7 - 12" locusts
3 - 14" maples
3 - 18" oaks
1 - 20" oak
1 - 30" sycamore
Converting the caliper to tree density units yields the following values:
Caliper Density Units No. Trees ETD
12" .8 x 7 = 5.6
14" 1.1 x 3 = 3.3
18" 1.8 x 3 = 5.4
20" 2.2 x 1 = 2.2
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
302
30" 4.9 x 1 = 4.9
Total = 21.4
This total represents the Existing Tree Density on site.
3. Step 3. Calculation of the replacement trees is determined by subtracting the
Existing Tree Density from the Required Tree Density.
EXAMPLE: RTD-ETD = replacement tree units
or
30 - 21.4 = 8.6 replacement tree units

4. Step 4. The number of replacement trees that would need to be planted, if any, is
determined by converting the replacement tree units to caliper inches or tree height
based on Tables 5.20 and 5.21. Any number or combination of trees that meets the
minimum required for replacement may be used; however, coniferous evergreens
shall be limited to no more than 40% of the total required replacement trees.
EXAMPLE: 10  3 red oaks = 6.0 tree units; 2  4 sycamores = 1.4 tree units; and
3  2 river birch = 1.5 tree units for a total of 8.9. Since 8.9 is greater than 8.6, the
minimum replacement trees requirement has been met.

J. Plan Review and Enforcement. All applications for a tree removal permit not a part of a site
plan or subdivision application are to be submitted to the Department of Community
Development. The Department shall review all applications to insure compliance with the
requirements of this section. Applications will be approved or denied within 20 days of
receipt of a complete application.
K. Revocation. The Administrative Officer may revoke the approval where there has been false
or misleading application or there is a noncompliance with the approved management plan.
L. Fees. The application and escrow fees for tree cutting and tree removal shall be in
accordance with Article IX.
M. Appeals. Any person aggrieved by the decision of any officer, pursuant to the provisions of
this section, may appeal to the Zoning Board of Adjustment within 10 days of receipt of such
decision. Such appeal shall follow the procedures as set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70a.
N. Violations and Penalties. In addition to any other penalties that may be assessed for violation
of this Ordinance, any person violating any provisions of this section shall be liable to a fine
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §541
304
not to exceed $500.00 or to imprisonment for a term not to exceed 90 days, or both, for each
offense. The destruction or substantial damage/destruction of an individual tree shall be
construed to be a separate offense. In addition, any tree(s) removed without a permit shall be
replaced by the violator with nursery stock, equal, whenever possible, to the caliper of the
tree(s) unlawfully removed. Replanting shall be completed in one year of the non-permitted
removal if the land is not to be lawfully developed. In addition to the foregoing, the
municipality may institute and maintain a civil action for injunctive relief restraining the
continuance of any unlawful tree removal project.

§ 542 Water Supply.
A. Public Water Required. Where a site is located within a public water franchise and public
water is accessible, water mains shall be constructed in such a manner as to make adequate
water service available to each lot or building within the development. The entire system
shall be designed in accordance with the requirements and standards of the local and/or State
agency having approval authority and shall be subject to their approval. The system shall
also be designed with adequate capacity and sustained pressure and in a looped system with
no dead-end lines, whenever possible.
B. Main Extension. Residential subdivisions shall be connected to an existing public water
supply system if public service is available within the following distances: 200 feet for one
unit, 400 feet for two units, 600 feet for three units, 800 feet for four units, and 1,000 feet for
five to fifteen units. For developments greater than fifteen units which are within one mile
of an existing public water system, adequate justification should be provided as to why they
should not provide a connection to the existing public water supply system. For
developments of greater than fifteen units which are more than one mile from an existing
systems, the water supply strategy shall be determined on a case-by-case basis taking into
consideration, the density of the developments, economic considerations, and ground water
availability and quality.
C. Non-Residential Uses. All non-residential uses, excepting religious and recreational uses,
shall be connected to a public water supply system.
D. Dry Lines. If a public water supply system will be provided to the area within a 6 year
period as indicated in the Utility Element of the Master Plan, Official Map, or other official
document, a municipality may require installation of a capped system or dry lines (mains
only) within the road right-of-way; or alternatively, a municipality may require a payment in
lieu of the improvement.
E. Individual Wells. Where no public water is accessible, water shall be furnished either on an
individual lot basis or by community well. The following provisions shall apply to the
installation of individual wells:
1. No person shall locate, construct or alter any individual water supply until a permit
for the proposed activity has been issued by the Municipal Health Officer.
2. No building permit for a new home or other structure for which an individual well is
required shall be issued unless the well has been drilled, tested and certified to be in
compliance with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection rules
pursuant to N.J.A.C. 7:10-12.1 et seq. for the construction of such public noncommunity
and non-public water systems. Such certification shall be made by the
applicant's engineer or well driller.

§ 700 Division of Jurisdiction in Development Applications.

the review of development applications:
1. The Planning Board shall have the power to grant subdivision or conditional use
approval simultaneously with site plan approval.
2. Review by Planning Board in lieu of Zoning Board of Adjustment. Whenever the
proposed development requires approval of a subdivision, site plan, or conditional
use, but not a variance pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d, the Planning Board, in lieu
of the Zoning Board of Adjustment, to the same extent and subject to the same
restrictions, shall receive, review, and act upon applications for variances and the
issuance of permits pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-32, -34, -36 and -70c.
3. Bifurcation of application. A developer may elect to submit a separate application
requesting approval of variances and the issuance of permits pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-32, -34, -36 and -70c and a subsequent application for any required approval
of a subdivision, site plan, or conditional use. The separate approval of any variance
or issuance of permit shall be conditioned upon the grant of all required subsequent
approvals by the Planning Board. No such subsequent approval shall be granted
unless the approval can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good
and without substantial impairment of the intent and purpose of the zone plan and
zoning ordinance, or where a deviation would advance the purposes of the Master
Plan and the Land Use Ordinance and the benefits of the deviation would outweigh
the detriments. Whenever relief is requested pursuant to this subsection, the public
notice shall include a reference to the request for a variance or direction for issuance
of a permit, as the case may be.
4. Grant variances pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70c.

§ 703 Decisions.
A. Findings and Conclusions. The municipal agency shall include findings of fact and
conclusions based thereon in each decision on any application for development and shall
reduce the decision to writing. The municipal agency shall provide the findings and
conclusions through:
1. A resolution adopted at a meeting held within the time period provided in this
section for action by the municipal agency on the application for development; or
2. A memorializing resolution adopted at a meeting held not later than 45 days after the
date of the meeting at which the municipal agency voted to grant or deny approval.
Only the members of the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment who voted
for the action taken may vote on the memorializing resolution, and the vote of a
majority of such members present at the meeting at which the resolution is presented
for adoption shall be sufficient to adopt the resolution. An action resulting from the
failure of a motion to approve an application shall be memorialized by resolution as
provided above, with those members voting against the motion for approval being
the members eligible to vote on the memorializing resolution. The vote on any such
resolution shall be deemed to be a memorialization of the action of the municipal
agency; however, the date of the adoption of the resolution shall constitute the date
of the decision for the purposes of the mailings, filings, and publications required by
§710.
B. Failure to Adopt Resolution. If the municipal agency fails to adopt a resolution or
memorializing resolution as hereinabove specified, any interested person may appeal to the
Superior Court in a summary manner for an order compelling the municipal agency to reduce
its findings and conclusions to writing within a stated time, and the cost of the application,
including attorneys fees, shall be assessed against the municipality.
C. Findings for Planned Developments. Prior to approval of a planned development the
Planning Board shall make the following findings and conclusions pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-45:
1. That departures by the proposed development from zoning regulations otherwise
applicable to the subject property conform to the zoning ordinance standards
pursuant to this Article;
2. That the proposals for maintenance and conservation of the common open space are
reliable, and the amount, location, and purpose of the common open space are
adequate;
3. That provisions through the physical design of the proposed development for public
services, control over vehicular and pedestrian traffic, and the amenities of light and
air, recreation and visual enjoyment are adequate.
4. That the proposed planned development will not have an unreasonably adverse
impact upon the area in which it is proposed to be established;
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §700 - 711
325
5. In the case of a proposed development which contemplates construction over a
period of years, that the terms and conditions intended to protect the interests of the
public and of the residents, occupants and owners of the proposed development in
the total completion of the development are adequate.

§ 705 Standards for Review of Applications.
Development plans shall be so designed as to enhance the general appearance of the Township and to
promote the harmonious use of land; to lessen congestion in the streets; to secure safety from fire,
panic, or other dangers; to promote the general health, safety, and welfare; to provide adequate light
and air; to prevent the overcrowding of land, buildings and roadways by an undue concentration of
population; to encourage development which would facilitate pedestrian access and the use of mass
transit; to encourage creative development and design consistent with the policies of the Master Plan
of the Township of Lawrence, and the regulations promulgated herein. Applications for development
shall be reviewed for meeting the standards for development contained within this Ordinance and
more particularly the following specific objectives:
A. Development Compatibility. All development shall permit and encourage only those uses of
the land which, through the standards adopted in this Ordinance, provide for flexibility in
planning and development and that respect the natural character of the land, the drainage
system, soil capabilities, groundwater and aquifer recharge quality, and to include only those
uses that are compatible with allowed uses in the zoning district and existing uses on
adjacent lands. Such compatibility shall be determined on the basis of inventories of the
natural features of the site, plans indicating the physical relationship among types of uses and
any natural or man-made barriers, existing or planned, between different uses both within
and adjacent to the proposed development, and sufficient information to determine the effect
of such development upon the quality of life of the Township of Lawrence.
B. Relationship to Lawrence Master Plan. All developments shall be planned and designed to
achieve the goals and objectives for land development as are or may be set forth in the
Lawrence Township Master Plan duly adopted by the Planning Board with regard to
conservation, historic preservation, community facilities, recreation, open space, recycling,
affordable housing, utility distribution, circulation, land use, fiscal impact, economic
development, and the goals for development of adjacent municipalities, Mercer County and
the State.
C. Relationship to Township Development Patterns. All development shall be planned and
designed to achieve the Township goals of permitting and encouraging a population density
and a development pattern in the municipality that facilitates the provision of public utilities
and services, including public water and public sewerage, storm drainage systems, recreation
areas, public schools, state, county, and local roads, in an orderly, functional and economical
manner.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §700 - 711
328
D. Conservation of Open Space. Common open space and adequate recreation areas shall be set
aside in suitable locations to provide for the recreation needs of the residents and the owners
of the development and those portions of the project that, because of their natural features,
constitute important visual amenities and environmental resources. Development is intended
to create after completion a continuity of open space resulting from the integration of upland,
wetland, floodplain and surface water areas in accordance with the goals and objectives of
the Master Plan.
E. Appearance and Aesthetic Control. All development shall be planned and designed to
promote and achieve aesthetically pleasing views from and to various land uses. The
creation and promotion of such aesthetic conditions shall strengthen and preserve the
municipality's unique environmental heritage and promote the civic pride, prosperity, and
general welfare of the residents of the development, the municipality, and visitors thereto.
F. Review Guidelines. The following guidelines shall be used in the review of any application
for development or conditional use:
1. Regard for natural features. All residential and non-residential uses shall be
designed with regard to the topography and natural features of the site. The effects
of prevailing winds, seasonal temperatures and hours of sunlight on the physical
layout and form of the proposed buildings shall be taken into account. Special
consideration shall be given to the preservation of natural features, including large
trees, stands of specimen vegetation, groves, waterways, aquifer recharge areas,
scenic, paleontological, archaeological, cultural, and historic sites and other
community assets within the site area, and the reduction of impacts on wildlife. The
development shall be designed and programmed so as to minimize tree clearance
and the destruction of natural amenities associated with the same.
2. Siting of buildings. All housing and supporting uses shall be sited so as to enhance
privacy for residential uses, ensure natural light for all principal residential rooms,
and to the greatest extent possible be designed to promote passive solar energy
technology. Buildings layout shall be reviewed for arrangement, efficiency and
aesthetic quality.
3. Fiscal impact. The fiscal costs to the Township and Board of Education from
providing services to the development shall be considered in relation to the gain of
revenue and its impact upon the municipal and school board tax rates.
4. Relationship to community facilities. Housing shall be conveniently served by
community facilities and open space.
5. Circulation. The pedestrian and vehicular traffic movement within and adjacent to
the site with particular emphasis on the provision and layout of parking areas, offstreet
loading and unloading, the movement of people, goods and vehicles from
access roads within the site, between buildings and between buildings and vehicles.
In particular, the Board shall ensure compliance in site design with the Americans
with Disabilities Act, as it may be amended or superseded. The Board shall ensure
that all parking spaces are usable and are safely and conveniently arranged. Access
to the site from adjacent roads shall be designed so as to interfere as little as possible
with traffic flow on these roads and to permit vehicles a rapid and safe ingress and
egress to the site. The circulation shall be consistent with Township, county, and
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §700 - 711
329
state requirements.
6. Open space. Open space within all planned unit developments shall be planned and
designed to achieve the Township goal of insuring that adequate recreation areas are
set aside in suitable locations to provide for the recreation needs of the residents and
owners of the planned unit development; and that those portions of the Township
that, because of their natural features, constitute important visual amenities and
environmental resources are maintained in accordance with sound conservation
practice.
7. Landscaping. Landscaping shall be reviewed for the ability to integrate the site
elements of topography, water, buildings, parking and loading areas, and the
buffering of incompatible uses. Landscaping shall be reviewed for diversity,
including species, function, sculpture, fencing, walls, and other landscaping
elements.
8. Lighting. Adequate lighting for the function of the site shall be reviewed for the
safe movement and security of persons and vehicles. Particular attention shall be
made to the minimization of glare and impact upon adjacent property.
9. Signs. Signs shall be evaluated for the aesthetics of their design and their harmony
with other signs on- and off-site, the architectural design of the building or buildings
to which they relate and the type of development or pattern of the built environment
surrounding the location of the sign or signs. The location of signs shall be reviewed
for the purpose of removing any hazard to pedestrians or motorists.
10. Utilities, solid waste management and recycling. Storm drainage, sanitary and solid
waste disposal including recycling, water supply, electricity supply, telephone and
cable television service shall be reviewed and considered. Emphasis shall be given
on the adequacy of existing systems and the need for improvements, both on- and
off-site to adequately provide for the development's needs.
11. Compatibility of residential and non-residential development. Applications for
development and conditional uses shall be designed to assure the compatibility of
residential and non-residential uses by:
a. Providing commercial uses with appropriate space and, in particular,
sufficient depth from a street to satisfy the needs of contemporary uses
including the provision of adequately landscaped off-street parking, buffer
areas between commercial and residential use areas, pedestrian and bicycle
circulation systems connecting the commercial uses to office, residential
and open space uses;
b. Protecting non-residential development and nearby residences against fire,
explosions, toxic and noxious matter, radiation and other hazards, and
against offensive noise, vibration, smoke, dust and other particulate matter,
odorous matter, heat, humidity, glare and other objectionable influences;
c. Protect residential and non-residential development from the noise, exhaust
emissions, and other negative aspects of congestion of vehicular traffic.

§ 706 Standards for Grant of Variance.
A. No variance or other relief may be granted under the terms of this Article unless such
variance or other relief can be granted without substantial detriment to the public good and
will not substantially impair the intent and purpose of the zone plan and Land Use
Ordinance.
B. Any variance from the terms of this Article hereafter granted by the Planning Board or
Zoning Board of Adjustment, as the case may be, permitting the erection or alteration of any
structure or structures, or permitting a specified use of any premises, shall expire by
limitation unless such construction or alteration shall have been actually commenced on each
and every structure permitted by said variance, or unless such permitted use has actually
been commenced, within 12 months from the date of entry of the judgment or determination
of the Zoning Board of Adjustment; except, however, that the running of the period of
limitation herein provided shall be tolled from the date of filing an appeal from the decision
of the Zoning Board of Adjustment to the Township Council, or to a court of competent
jurisdiction, until the termination in any manner of such appeal or proceeding. (See also
§108).
§ 707 Appeals and Applications to the Zoning Board of
Adjustment.
A. Appeals to the Zoning Board of Adjustment may be taken by an interested party affected by
any decision of the Administrative Officer of the municipality based on or made in the
enforcement of the zoning provisions of this Ordinance or a duly adopted official map. Such
appeal shall be taken within 20 days by filing a notice of appeal with the official from whom
the appeal was taken, specifying the grounds of such appeal. The official from whom the
appeal is taken shall immediately transmit to the Board all the papers constituting the record
upon which the action appealed from was taken.
B. A developer may file an application for development with the Zoning Board of Adjustment
for action under any of its powers without prior application to the Administrative Officer.
C. Whenever an application for development requests relief pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d,
the Zoning Board of Adjustment shall grant or deny approval of the application within 120
days after submission by an applicant of a complete application to the Administrative Officer
or within such further time as may be consented to by the applicant. In the event that the
applicant elects to submit separate consecutive applications, the aforesaid provision shall
apply to the application for approval of the variance. The period for granting or denying any
subsequent approval shall be as otherwise provided in this Ordinance. Failure of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment to act within the period prescribed shall constitute approval of the
application and a certificate of the Administrative Officer as to the failure of the Zoning
Board of Adjustment to act shall be issued on request of the applicant, and it shall be
sufficient in lieu of the written endorsement or other evidence of approval, herein required,
and shall be so accepted by the county recording officer for purposes of filing subdivision
plats.

c. It meets the needs of public health and safety; and
d. It takes into account existing infrastructure and possible surrounding future
development.
B. Waiver Request (N.J.A.C. 5:21-3.2).
1. A municipality or developer may, in connection with a specific development,
request a waiver of any site improvement standard adopted under this section in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-40.4(c). A waiver request may also be made
jointly by a municipality and a developer.
2. The Site Improvement Advisory Board may approve a request for a waiver based on
any danger to public health and safety that would be caused by adherence to a
standard specified in this section.
3. A waiver may be requested by a municipality or a developer, or the request may be
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §700 - 711
334
made jointly. The waiver request shall consist of the following:
a. A copy of the development application as submitted to the municipal
approving authority; and
b. A brief memorandum to the Commissioner of the Department of
Community Affairs containing sufficient information upon which to base a
determination, including:
(1) A short description of the project in narrative form;
(2) A citation to the particular site improvement standard from which
waiver is requested;
(3) A clear description of the condition(s) giving rise to the request;
(4) A clear description of the anticipated result if the standard were to
be followed;
(5) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for
the developer; and
(6) The name, address, and telephone number of a contact person for
the municipal approving authority.
c. The party requesting the waiver shall send the request to the New Jersey
Department of Community Affairs, Division of Codes and Standards, 101
South Broad Street, CN 802, Trenton, NJ 08625-0802.

copy of the request to the administrative officer of the municipality
concerned. Where a waiver is requested by the municipality, the
municipality shall send a copy of the request to the developer.

authority at any time during the pendency of a development application.
The Site Improvement Advisory Board recommends submission of a waiver
request early in the application process or prior to the submission of a
formal development application. If the applicant or the municipal approving
authority determines during the planning board review process that a waiver
request is appropriate, the municipal approving authority shall give
consideration whenever possible to the granting of an extension for the
purpose of pursuing a waiver. In some cases it may be impracticable for the
party requesting or appealing a waiver to complete the waiver process
within the time guidelines of the Municipal Land Use Law (N.J.S.A.
40:55D-1 et seq.; see, for example, N.J.S.A. 40:55D-45.3, 46(c), 46.1, 47,
48, and 50). In such cases, the municipal approving authority may provide
for the disposition of the waiver as a condition of its approval.
f. There is no fee for requesting a waiver.
C. Waiver Review (N.J.A.C. 5:21-3.3).
1. The Commissioner shall review the waiver request to determine whether it appears
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §700 - 711
335
on preliminary review that adherence to a particular standard would jeopardize the
public health and safety.
a. If the waiver request on its face does not meet the requirements of this
subsection, the Commissioner shall contact the requesting party within 20
days of receipt of the request and advise the requesting party of the waiver
request rejection. Grounds for rejection shall be indicated in writing.
2. Within 20 days of receipt of a waiver request, the Commissioner shall date and mark
as justified for review each waiver request accepted for review. The Commissioner
shall then direct each such waiver request to the Site Improvement Advisory Board's
Technical Committee which consists of Board members representative of,
respectively, the New Jersey Society of Professional Engineers; the New Jersey
Society of Municipal Engineers; and the New Jersey Builders Association (See
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-40.4(c)).
3. The Commissioner shall send notice of the Commissioner's determination of
justification to designated contacts at the same time as the waiver request is sent to
the Technical Committee.
4. The Technical Committee shall render a decision by resolution within 30 days of the
Commissioner's determination that the waiver request is justified.
5. A waiver resolution adopted by the committee shall specify the grounds for granting
or denying the waiver request.
6. The Commissioner shall promptly notify the developer and the municipal approving
authority of the committee's decision, and shall provide a copy of the resolution
memorializing such decision to those parties and to the Site Improvement Advisory
Board.
D. Appeal of Waiver Decisions (N.J.A.C. 5:21-3.4).
1. Any decision of the technical committee may be appealed to the Site Improvement
Advisory Board, which shall hear appeals in public session at regularly scheduled or
special meetings announced in compliance with the Open Public Meetings Act (See
N.J.S.A. 10:4-6 et seq.).

clarify or supplement materials previously submitted.
4. The hearings shall be informal. Rules of evidence shall not apply, but the presiding
officer may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.
5. The testimony of all witnesses in a waiver appeal shall be under oath or affirmation
and shall be recorded verbatim either mechanically or stenographically. Transcripts
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §700 - 711
336
may be obtained at the expense of the requesting party and shall be certified by the
transcriber to be accurate.
6. The Site Improvement Advisory Board shall render a final decision within 10 days
of the hearing. The Board's decision shall be in writing, and shall contain findings
and conclusions. The Board shall mail a copy of the decision to the developer and

land areas to be developed within a given period, or provision of physical
means to address critical or unique environmental conditions. Such
conditions shall be predicated on the following criteria:
(1) That each stage of a planned unit development shall contain, within
reasonable limits, a balance of commercial and residential uses,
open space, and community facilities to assure that the planned unit
development is a viable self-sustaining community unit at any
given stage in its growth.
(2) That each stage of development shall include required open space
in proportion to that part of the total commercial and residential
development units in the planned unit development that are to be
developed in that stage. Such open space shall include both
recreation and conservation uses accessible to the general public
and open space which shall be physically proximate and accessible
to the resident population within the planned unit development.
(3) That the size and timing of successive stages of a planned unit
development shall be conditioned upon the availability and
provision of suitable capacity of facilities such as arterial highways,
Land Use Ordinance

condition any approval upon the timely receipt of favorable action on the application
by the Mercer County Planning Board or approval by the Mercer County Planning
Board by its failure to report thereon within the required time period.
8. Failure of the Board to act within the time period prescribed shall constitute
approval, and a certificate of the Administrative Officer as to the failure of the
Board to act shall be issued on the request of the applicant. Such certificate shall be
sufficient in lieu of a resolution of approval and written endorsements and shall be
accepted by the county recording officer for the purpose of filing.

B. Purpose of Fees. The application charge is a flat fee to cover direct administrative expenses
and is non-refundable. The escrow account is established to cover the costs of professional
services including engineering, legal, planning and other expenses connected with the review
of the submitted materials. In accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53 and N.J.S.A. 40:55D-
53.1, sums not utilized in the review process shall be returned to the applicant upon written
request. If additional sums are deemed necessary, the applicant shall be notified by certified
mail or personal service of the required additional amount and shall add such sum to the
escrow. Payment shall be due from the applicant within 15 days of receipt of the notice. If
payment is not received within 15 days, the applicant shall be considered to be in default,
and such default may be grounds for denial of the application.
C. More Than One Request. Where one application for development includes several approval
requests, the sum of the individual required fees shall be paid.
D. Costs of Review and Inspection. Each applicant for subdivision or site plan approval shall
agree in writing to pay all reasonable costs for professional review of the application,
including costs incurred with any informal review of a concept plan which may have
preceded the submission of a preliminary application. Additionally, each applicant shall
agree in writing to pay all reasonable costs for the municipal inspection of the constructed
improvements. All such costs for review and inspection must be paid before any
construction permit is issued and all remaining costs must be paid in full before any
occupancy issued or bonding is released.
E. Court Reporter. If an applicant desires a court reporter, the cost of taking testimony and
transcribing it and providing a copy of the transcript to the municipality shall be at the
expense of the applicant who shall arrange for the reporter's attendance. The municipality
provides for the tape recording of the proceedings before the Board.
F. Waiver of Fees for Affordable Housing. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Ordinance, a waiver of all municipal subdivision and site plan escrow fees and building
permit and certificate of occupancy fees shall be granted by the approving municipal agency
for all housing units being provided by the applicant for low and moderate income families.
§ 901 Affordable Housing Contribution
[Ord. 2302-18, 8/28/18]
A. Purpose.
1. In Holmdel Builders Association V. Holmdel Township, 121 N.J. 550 (1990),
the New Jersey Supreme Court determined that mandatory development fees
are authorized by the Fair Housing Act of 1985 (the Act), N.J.S.A. 52:27d-
301, et seq., and the State Constitution, subject to the Council on Affordable
Housings (COAH) adoption of rules for the establishment, implementation,
review, monitoring and enforcement of municipal affordable housing trust funds
and spending plans.
2. According to P.L. 2008, c. 46 section 8 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-329.2), and the Statewide
Non-Residential Development Fee Act (N.J.S.A. 40:55D-8.1 through 8.7),
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
382
municipalities under the jurisdiction of COAH or a court of competent jurisdiction
that had an approved spending plan w e r e p e r m i t t e d t o retain fees
collected from non-residential development.
3. In In Re Adoption of N.J.A.C. 5:96 and 5:97 by the New Jersey Council on
Affordable Housing, 221 N.J. 1 (2015), also known as the Mount Laurel IV decision,
the Supreme Court remanded COAHs duties to the Superior Court. As a result,
affordable housing development fee collections and expenditures from the
municipal affordable housing trust funds to implement municipal Third Round Fair
Share Plans through July 1, 2025 are under the Courts jurisdiction and are subject
to approval by the Court.
4. This Section establishes standards for the collection, maintenance, and expenditure
of development fees consistent with COAHs regulations and in accordance with
P.L. 2008, c. 46, Sections 8 and 32-38. Fees collected pursuant to this Ordinance
shall be used for the sole purpose of providing low- and moderate- income
housing. This Ordinance shall be interpreted within the framework of applicable
COAH rules on development fees.
B. Basic Requirements.
1. This Ordinance shall not become effective until the Court approves the
Townships a m e n d e d development fee ordinance and shall remain effective
pursuant to the Superior Courts jurisdiction through July 1, 2025.
2. COAH approved the Townships initial Spending Plan on or about October 19,
1987, and subsequently approved a Third Round Spending Plan on or about April 2,
2009. Upon the Court's approval of Lawrence Township's 2018 Spending Plan,
Lawrence Township may continue to spend development fees consistent with the
approved Spending Plan.
C. Definitions.
The following te rms, as used in this ordinance, shall have the following meanings (see
also §201):
1. Affordable housing development means a development included in the Housing
Element and Fair Share Plan, and includes, but is not limited to, an
inclusionary development, a municipal construction project or a 100 percent
affordable development.
2. COAH or the Council means the New Jersey Council on Affordable Housing
established under the Act.
3. Developer means the legal or beneficial owner or owners of a lot or of any land
proposed to be included in a proposed development, including the holder of an
option or contract to purchase, or other person having an enforceable proprietary
interest in such land.
4. Development fee means money paid by a developer for the improvement of
property as permitted in N.J.A.C. 5:93-8.
5. Equalized assessed value means the assessed value of a property divided by the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
383
current average ratio of assessed to true value for the municipality in which the
property is situated, as determined in accordance with sections 1, 5, and 6 of P.L.
1973, c. 123 (N.J.S.A. 54:1-35a through 54:1-35c).
6. Green building strategies means those strategies that minimize the impact of
development on the environment, and enhance the health, safety and well-being of
residents by producing durable, low-maintenance, resource-efficient housing
while making optimum use of existing infrastructure and community services.
D. Residential Development Fees.
1. Imposed fees.
a. Within the all district(s), residential developers, except for developers of the
types of development specifically exempted below, shall pay a fee of one
and a half percent (1.5%) of the equalized assessed value for residential
development provided no increased density is permitted.
b. When an increase in residential density pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-70d(5)
(known as a d variance) has been permitted, developers may be required
to pay a development fee of six percent (6%) of the equalized assessed
value for each additional unit that may be realized. However, if the zoning
on a site has changed during the two-year period preceding the filing of
such a variance application, the base density for the purposes of calculating
the bonus development fee shall be the highest density permitted by right
during the two-year period preceding the filing of the variance application.
2. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for residential development.
a. Affordable housing developments and developments where the developer
has made a payment in lieu of on-site construction of affordable units shall
be exempt from development fees.
b. Developments that have received preliminary or final site plan approval
prior to the adoption of a municipal development fee ordinance shall be
exempt from development fees, unless the developer seeks a substantial
change in the approval. Where a site plan approval does not apply, a
zoning and/or building permit shall be synonymous with preliminary or
final site plan approval for this purpose. The fee percentage shall be
vested on the date that the building permit is issued. Development fees
shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure is demolished
and replaced if the expansion is not otherwise exempt from the
development fee requirement. The development fee shall be calculated on
the increase in the equalized assessed value of the improved structure.
c. Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing
structure undergoes a change to a more intense use, is demolished and
replaced, or is expanded, if the expansion is not otherwise exempt from the
development fee requirement. The development fee shall be calculated on
the increase in the equalized assessed value of the improved structure.
d. Developers of one or two-owner occupied dwelling units, residential
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
384
structures demolished and replaced as a result of a natural disaster, green
buildings, etc., shall be exempt from paying a development fee.
E. Non-Residential Development Fees.
1. Imposed fees.
a. Within all zoning districts, non-residential developers, except for developers
of the types of development specifically exempted, shall pay a fee equal to
two and one-half (2.5) percent of the equalized assessed value of the land
and improvements, for all new non-residential construction on an
unimproved lot or lots.
b. Non-residential developers, except for developers of the types of
development specifically exempted, shall also pay a fee equal to two and
one-half (2.5) percent of the increase in equalized assessed value resulting
from any additions to existing structures to be used for non-residential
purposes.
c. Development fees shall be imposed and collected when an existing structure
is demolished and replaced. The development fee of two and a half percent
(2.5%) shall be calculated on the difference between the equalized assessed
value of the pre-existing land and improvement and the equalized assessed
value of the newly improved structure, i.e. land and improvement, at the
time final certificate of occupancy is issued. If the calculation required
under this section results in a negative number, the non-residential
development fee shall be zero.
2. Eligible exactions, ineligible exactions and exemptions for non-residential
development.
a. The non-residential portion of a mixed-use inclusionary or market rate
development shall be subject to the two and a half (2.5) percent
development fee, unless otherwise exempted below.
b. The 2.5 percent fee shall not apply to an increase in equalized assessed
value resulting from alterations, change in use within existing footprint,
reconstruction, renovations and repairs.
c. Non-residential developments shall be exempt from the payment of nonresidential
development fees in accordance with the exemptions required
pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46, as specified in the Form N-RDF State of New
Jersey Non-Residential Development Certification/Exemption Form. Any
exemption claimed by a developer shall be substantiated by that developer.
d. A developer of a non-residential development exempted from the nonresidential
development fee pursuant to P.L.2008, c.46 shall be subject to it
at such time the basis for the exemption no longer applies, and shall make
the payment of the non-residential development fee, in that event, within
three years after that event or after the issuance of the final certificate of
occupancy of the non-residential development, whichever is later.
e. If a property which was exempted from the collection of a non-residential
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
385
development fee thereafter ceases to be exempt from property taxation, the
owner of the property shall remit the fees required pursuant to this section
within 45 days of the termination of the property tax exemption. Unpaid
non-residential development fees under these circumstances may be
enforceable by Lawrence Township as a lien against the real property of the
owner.
F. Collection Procedures.
1. Upon the granting of a preliminary, final or other applicable approval, for a
development, the applicable approving authority shall direct its staff to notify the
construction official responsible for the issuance of a building permit.
2. For non-residential developments only, the developer shall also be provided with a
copy of Form N-RDF State of New Jersey Non-Residential Development
Certification/Exemption to be completed as per the instructions provided. The
Developer of a non-residential development shall complete Form N-RDF as per the
instructions provided. The construction official shall verify the information
submitted by the non-residential developer as per the instructions provided in the
Form N-RDF. The Tax assessor shall verify exemptions and prepare estimated and
final assessments as per the instructions provided in Form N-RDF.
3. The construction official responsible for the issuance of a building permit shall
notify the local tax assessor of the issuance of the first building permit for a
development which is subject to a development fee.
4. Within 90 days of receipt of that notice, the municipal tax assessor, based on the
plans filed, shall provide an estimate of the equalized assessed value of the
development.
5. The construction official responsible for the issuance of a final certificate of
occupancy notifies the local assessor of any and all requests for the scheduling of a
final inspection on property which is subject to a development fee.
6. Within 10 business days of a request for the scheduling of a final inspection, the
municipal assessor shall confirm or modify the previously estimated equalized
assessed value of the improvements of the development; calculate the development
fee; and thereafter notify the developer of the amount of the fee.
7. Should Lawrence Township fail to determine or notify the developer of the amount
of the development fee within 10 business days of the request for final inspection,
the developer may estimate the amount due and pay that estimated amount
consistent with the dispute process set forth in subsection b. of section 37 of
P.L.2008, c.46 (C.40:55D-8.6).
8. Fifty percent of the development fee shall be collected at the time of issuance of the
building permit. The remaining portion shall be collected at the issuance of the
certificate of occupancy. The developer shall be responsible for paying the
difference between the fee calculated at building permit and that determined at
issuance of certificate of occupancy.
9. Appeal of development fees.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
386
a. A developer may challenge residential development fees imposed by filing
a challenge with the County Board of Taxation. Pending a review and
determination by the Board, collected fees shall be placed in an interest
bearing escrow account by Lawrence Township. Appeals from a
determination of the Board may be made to the tax court in accordance with
the provisions of the State Tax Uniform Procedure Law, R.S.54:48-1 et
seq., within 90 days after the date of such determination. Interest earned on
amounts escrowed shall be credited to the prevailing party.
b. A developer may challenge non-residential development fees imposed by
filing a challenge with the Director of the Division of Taxation. Pending a
review and determination by the Director, which shall be made within 45
days of receipt of the challenge, collected fees shall be placed in an interest
bearing escrow account by Lawrence Township. Appeals from a
determination of the Director may be made to the tax court in accordance
with the provisions of the State Tax Uniform Procedure Law, N.J.S.A.
54:48-1 et seq., within 90 days after the date of such determination. Interest
earned on amounts escrowed shall be credited to the prevailing party.
G. Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
1. The Township has created a separate, interest-bearing housing trust fund to be
maintained by the chief financial officer for the purpose of depositing development
fees collected from residential and non-residential developers and proceeds from the
sale of units with extinguished controls.
2. The following additional funds shall be deposited in the Affordable Housing Trust
Fund and shall at all times be identifiable by source and amount:
a. Payments in lieu of on-site construction of affordable units;
b. Developer contributed funds to make ten percent (10%) of the adaptable
entrances in a townhouse or other multistory attached development
accessible;
c. Rental income from municipally operated units;
d. Repayments from affordable housing program loans;
e. Recapture funds;
f. Proceeds from the sale of affordable units; and
g. Any other funds collected in connection with Lawrence Townships
affordable housing program.

form of a three-party escrow agreement between the municipality, the bank and
COAH to permit COAH to direct the disbursement of the funds as provided for in
N.J.A.C. 5:93-8. The Superior Court shall now have the jurisdiction to direct the
disbursement of the Townships trust funds as originally provided to COAH.
4. All interest accrued in the housing trust fund shall only be used on eligible
affordable housing activities approved by the Court.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
387
H. Use of Funds.
1. The expenditure of all funds shall conform to a spending plan approved by the
Superior Court. Funds deposited in the housing trust fund may be used for any
activity approved by the Superior Court to address the Townships fair share
obligation and may be set up as a grant or revolving loan program. Such activities
include, but are not limited to: preservation or purchase of housing for the purpose
of maintaining or implementing affordability controls, rehabilitation, new
construction of affordable housing units and related costs, accessory apartment,
market to affordable, or regional housing partnership programs, conversion of
existing non-residential buildings to create new affordable units, green building
strategies designed to be cost saving and in accordance with accepted national or
state standards, purchase of land for affordable housing, improvement of land to
be used for affordable housing, extensions or improvements of roads and
infrastructure to affordable housing sites, financial assistance designed to increase
affordability, administration necessary for implementation of the Housing Element
and Fair Share Plan, or any other activity as permitted pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:93-
8.16 and specified in the approved spending plan.
2. Funds shall not be expended to reimburse Lawrence Township for past housing
activities.
3. At least 30 percent of all development fees collected and interest earned shall be
used to provide affordability assistance to low- and moderate-income households in
affordable units included in the municipal Fair Share Plan. One-third of the
affordability assistance portion of development fees collected shall be used to
provide affordability assistance to those households earning 30 percent or less of
median income by region.
a. Affordability assistance programs may include down payment assistance,
security deposit assistance, low interest loans, rental assistance, assistance
with homeowners association or condominium fees and special
assessments, and assistance with emergency repairs.
b. Affordability assistance to households earning 30 percent or less of median
income may include buying down the cost of low or moderate income units
in the municipal Fair Share Plan to make them affordable to households
earning 30 percent or less of median income. The use of development fees
in this manner may entitle Lawrence Township to bonus credits pursuant to
N.J.A.C. 5:97-3.7.
c. Payments in lieu of constructing affordable units on site and funds from the
sale of units with extinguished controls shall be exempt from the
affordability assistance requirement.
4. The Township may contract with a private or public entity to administer any part of
its Housing Element and Fair Share Plan, including the requirement for affordability
assistance.
5. No more than twenty percent (20%) of all revenues collected from development
fees may be expended on administration, including, but not limited to, salaries and
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
388
benefits for municipal employees or consultant fees necessary to develop or
implement a new construction program, a Housing Element and Fair Share Plan,
and/or an affirmative marketing program. In the case of a rehabilitation program, no
more than twenty percent (20%) of the revenues collected from development fees
shall be expended for such administrative expenses. Administrative funds may be
used for income qualification of households, monitoring the turnover of sale and
rental units, and compliance with the monitoring requirements set forth in the
Court-approved April 28, 2017 executed Settlement Agreement with Fair Share
Housing Center. Legal or other fees related to litigation opposing affordable housing
sites or objecting to the Court's rulings are not eligible uses of the affordable housing
trust fund.
I. Monitoring.
1. On or about June 30 of each year through 2025, the Township shall provide annual
reporting of trust fund activity to the New Jersey Department of Community Affairs
(DCA), COAH, or Local Government Services (LGS), or other entity designated
by the State of New Jersey, with a copy provided to Fair Share Housing Center
and Intervenors and posted on the municipal website, using forms developed for
this purpose by DCA, COAH, or LGS. This reporting shall include an accounting
of all housing trust fund activity, including the collection of development fees from
residential and non-residential developers, payments in lieu of constructing
affordable units on site, funds from the sale of units with extinguished controls,
barrier free escrow funds, rental income, repayments from affordable housing
program loans, and any other funds collected in connection with the Townships
housing program, as well as to the expenditure of revenues and implementation of the
plan approved by the Superior Court.
J. Ongoing Collection of Fees.
1. The ability for the Township to impose, collect and expend development fees shall
expire with its Court-issued Judgment of Compliance and Repose unless the
Township of Lawrence has f i r s t filed an adopted Housing Element and Fair
Share Plan with the Superior Court or other appropriate jurisdiction, has filed a
petition for certification or a Declaratory Judgment Action, and has received
approval of its development fee ordinance from the appropriate jurisdiction.
2. If the Township fails to renew its ability to impose and collect development fees
prior to the expiration of its Judgment of Compliance and Repose, it may be
subject to forfeiture of any or all funds remaining within its municipal trust fund.
Any funds so forfeited shall be deposited into the "New Jersey Affordable Housing
Trust Fund" established pursuant to section 20 of P.L. 1985, c.222 (N.J.S.A. 52:27D-
320).
3. The Township shall not impose a residential development fee on a development
that receives preliminary or final site plan approval after the expiration of its
Judgment of Compliance and Repose, nor shall the Township retroactively impose a
development fee on such a development. The Township shall not expend
development fees after the expiration of its Judgment of Compliance and Repose

that will be reviewing and approving its 2025 Housing Element and Fair Share Plan
§ 902 Guarantees Required for On- and Off-tract Improvements.
[Ord. 2304-18, 8/28/18]
A. Guarantee Required. Before recording final subdivision plats or recording of minor
subdivision deeds or as a condition of final site plan approval or as a condition to the
issuance of a zoning permit pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-65d, the Township or approving
Board, for the purposes of assuring the installation and maintenance of on-and off-tract
(pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-42) improvements, shall require and accept in accordance with
the standards adopted by this Ordinance, the following:
1. The furnishing of a performance guaranteed in favor of the Township of Lawrence
in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of only those improvements required
by an approval or developers agreement, ordinance, or regulation to be dedicated to
a public entity, and that have not yet been installed, which cost shall be determined
by the developer and approved by the Municipal Engineer, according to the method
of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4, for the following improvements as
shown on the approved plans or plat: streets, pavement, gutters, curbs, sidewalks,
street lighting, street trees, surveyor's monuments, as shown on the final map and
required by the Map Filing Law (N.J.S.A. 46:23-9.9 et seq.), water mains, sanitary
sewers, community septic systems, drainage structures, public improvements of
open space, and any grading necessitated by the preceding improvements. The
performance guarantee may also be required to include, at the discretion of the
Township or approving Board, a guarantee for the installation of privately-owned
perimeter buffer landscaping. At the developers option, a separate performance
guarantee may be posted for the privately-owned perimeter buffer landscaping. The
developer shall prepare an itemized cost estimate of the improvements covered by
the performance guarantee for review and approval by the Municipal Engineer,
which improvements shall be appended to each performance guarantee posted by the
obligor.
2. The developer shall post with the Township, prior to the release of the performance
guarantee, a maintenance guarantee in an amount equal to 15% of the cost of the
installation of the improvements covered under the performance guarantee, along
with the following private site improvements: stormwater management basins, inflow
and water quality structures within the basins, and the out-flow pipes and
structures of the stormwater management system, if any, which itemized cost shall
be determined by the developer and approved by the municipal engineer according
to the method of calculation set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4. The term of the
maintenance guarantee shall be for a period not to exceed two years and shall
automatically expire at the end of the established term.
3. The furnishing of a safety and stabilization guarantee in favor of the Township of
Lawrence to ensure that the Township has an adequate guarantee to return the
property that has been disturbed to a safe and stable condition or otherwise
implement measures to protect the public from access to an unsafe or unstable
condition. The Township shall be permitted to access the guarantee when (i) site
disturbance has commenced and, thereafter, all work on the development has ceased
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
390
for a period of at least 60 consecutive days following such commencement for
reasons other than force majeure; and (ii) work has not recommenced within 30 days
following the provision of written notice by the municipality to the developer of the
municipalitys intent to claim payment under the guarantee. At the developers
option, the safety and stabilization guarantee may be included as a line item for
safety and stabilization in the performance guarantee rather than in the form of a
separate guarantee. The amount of the safety and stabilization guarantee shall be
calculated pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as follows:
a. $5,000 for the first $100,000 of bonded improvement costs, plus
b. Two and a half percent (2.5%) of bonded improvement costs in excess of
$100,000 up to $1,000,000; plus
c. One percent (1%) of bonded improvement costs in excess of $1,000,000.
B. Time Period for Installation. All public improvements shall be completed within six (6)
months of issuance of the last Certificate of Occupancy or five (5) years of issuance of a Soil
Disturbance Permit whichever comes first. The time allowed for installation of the bonded
improvements for which the performance guarantee has been provided may be extended by
the Township Council by resolution. As a condition or part of any such extension, the
amount of any performance guarantee shall be increased or reduced, as the case may be, to
an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of the installation, as determined by the developer
and approved by the municipal engineer according to the method of calculation set forth in
N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4 as of the time of the passage of the resolution.
C. Developer Liability. If the required bonded improvements are not completed or corrected in
accordance with the performance guarantee, the developer and surety, if any, shall be liable
thereon to the Township for the reasonable cost of the improvements not completed or
corrected and the Township may either prior to or after the receipt of the proceeds thereof
complete such improvements. Such completion or correction of improvements shall be
subject to the public bidding requirements of the Local Public Contracts Law (N.J.S.A.
40A:11-1 et seq.).
§ 903 Certification or Guarantee required; Estimate of
Guarantee.
A. Improvements to be Installed. No final plan shall be approved unconditionally by the Board
until the satisfactory completion and performance of all such required improvements have
been certified to the Board by the Municipal Engineer, unless the owner shall have filed with
the municipality a performance guarantee sufficient in amount to cover the cost of all such
improvements in uncompleted portions thereof as estimated by the Municipal Engineer, and
assuring the installation of such uncompleted improvements on or before an agreed upon
date.

Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
391
D. Determination of Maintenance Guarantee Estimate. The approved performance guarantee
estimate shall fix the requirements of maintenance of the utilities and improvements to be
installed and completed by the developer. A surety company or cash bond meeting the
requirements herein above set forth may be furnished to secure the maintenance guarantee,
or the performance bond may be styled or amended to provide such security in reduced
amount in keeping with the requirements.
§ 904 Approval by Township Attorney.
A. The applicant shall present two (2) copies of the performance guarantee in an amount equal
to the amount of the approved performance guarantee estimate for approval as to form and
execution by the Department of Finance with assistance by the Township Attorney, if
necessary.
B. The Department of Finance shall forward its approval of the form of the performance
guarantee for consideration for adoption by the governing body.
§ 905 Bonding and Cash Requirements.
A. The performance guarantee shall be the approved performance guarantee estimate and as
surety a performance bond in which the applicant shall be principal, the bond to be provided
by an acceptable surety company licensed to do business in the State of New Jersey, an
irrevocable letter of credit drawn on a banking or savings and loan institution located in and
licensed to do business in the State of New Jersey or such other form of security as may be
approved by the Township Attorney, or cash, or a certified check shall be deposited with the
Township of Lawrence by payment to the Township Treasurer. The performance guarantee
in favor of the Township shall be in an amount not to exceed 120% of the cost of the
installation and improvements. The Township Treasurer shall issue its receipt for such cash
deposits and shall cause the same to be deposited in a bank named by the Township for this
purpose to be retained as security for completion of all requirements and to be returned to the
developer on completion of all required work and expiration of the period of maintenance
guarantee or, in the event of default on the part of the subdivider, to be used by the Township
of Lawrence to pay the cost and expense of obtaining completion of all requirements. Every
bond, whether cash or surety, shall contain a clause to the effect that the obligation shall
remain in full force and effect until such time as certification is received from the Municipal
Engineer that the principal has met and complied with all specifications and requirements for
which said cash or surety bond has been posted.
B. Ten percent (10%) of the amount of the approved performance guarantee estimates shall be
deposited with the Township by the applicant in cash. The remaining 90% may be in cash,
surety bond or other securities or guaranties approved by the Township Attorney. In the
event of default, the ten-percent fund herein mentioned shall be first applied to the
completion of the requirements and the cash or the surety shall thereafter be resorted to, if
necessary, for the completion of the requirements. The cash or surety may recite the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
392
foregoing provisions. The Municipal Engineer's determination that the principal has
defaulted in his obligation shall be binding and conclusive upon the principal.
C. Irrevocable letters of credit shall include, but not be limited to, the following provisions:
1. An unconditional payment obligation of the issuer running solely to the Township
for an express initial period of time in the amount determined pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-53 (see §903.B).
2. Is for a period of time of at least two years; and
3. Permits the Township to draw upon the letter of credit if the developer fails to
furnish another letter of credit which complies with the provisions of this subsection
30 days or more in advance of the expiration date of the letter of credit or such
longer period in advance thereof as is stated in the letter of credit.
§ 906 Inspections and Tests.
A. All improvements and utility installations shall be inspected during the time of their
installation under the supervision of the Municipal Engineer to ensure satisfactory
completion. The cost of said inspection shall be the responsibility of the applicant, and he
shall deposit with the Township Treasurer for placement in a trust fund account a sum equal
to 5% of the amount of the performance guarantee estimate of the cost of public
improvements to be built in the subdivision or site development to be applied to the payment
of inspection costs. If inspection costs exceed such fund, the developer shall deposit with the
Township Treasurer additional sums upon notice from the Municipal Engineer. The
inspection fee shall in no case be less than $500.00. The Township Treasurer shall return
any balance of the inspection deposit to the developer upon expiration of the maintenance
bond, together with the paid invoices for all expenses charged.
B. In no case shall any paving work be done without permission from the Municipal Engineer's
office. At least two days' notice shall be given to the Municipal Engineer's office prior to
any such construction so that he or a qualified representative may be present at the time the
work is to be done.
C. The Municipal Engineer's office shall be notified after each of the following phases of the
work has been completed so that he or a qualified representative may inspect the:
1. Soil disturbance activities;
2. Road subgrade;
3. Curb and gutter forms;
4. Curbs and gutters;
5. Road paving;
6. Sidewalk forms;
7. Sidewalks;
8. Drainage pipes and other drainage structures before backfilling;
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
393
9. Street name signs;
10. Survey monuments; and
11. Street trees;
and in the case of site plan inspection:
12. Parking lots;
13. Lighting;
14. Landscaping; and
15. Signage.
D. A final inspection of all improvements and utilities will be done by the Municipal Engineer
within 10 days of notification by the developer to determine whether the work is satisfactory
and in agreement with the approved final plat drawings and the Township specifications.
The general condition of the site shall also be considered. Upon a satisfactory final
inspection report, action will be taken to release or declare in default the performance
guarantee covering such improvements and utilities.
E. Inspection by the Township of the installation of improvements and utilities by the applicant
shall not subject the Township to liability for claims, suits or any other liability of any kind
that may at any time arise because of defects or negligence during construction or at any time
thereafter; it is recognized that the responsibility to maintain safe conditions at all times
during construction and to provide proper utilities and improvements is upon the applicant
and his contractors, if any.
F. Improvements installed without notice for inspection shall constitute a valid cause for any of
the following actions:
1. The issuance of a stop work order;
2. The removal of any improvements not so inspected;
3. The payment by the developer of any costs of materials testing by the municipal for
the improvements not so inspected;
4. The restoration of the site from disturbance caused by the materials testing process.
G. Improvements installed contrary to the approved plat shall be a rebuttable presumptive that
such approval is null and void.
§ 907 Reduction of Guarantee.
[Ord. 2304-18, 8/28/18]
A. Upon substantial completion of all required street improvements (except for the top course)
and appurtenant utility improvements, and the connection of same to the public system, the
developer may request of the Township Council in writing, by certified mail addressed in
care of the Township Clerk, that the Municipal Engineer prepare, in accordance with the
itemized cost estimate §902.A, a list of all uncompleted or unsatisfactory completed
improvements. If such a request is made, the developer shall send a copy of the request to
the Municipal Engineer. As-built plans, pursuant to §910.B, shall be submitted prior to the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
394
request for a reduction in the guarantee. The request shall indicate which improvements
have been completed and which bonded improvements remain uncompleted in the judgment
of the developer. Thereupon the Municipal Engineer shall inspect all improvements covered
by the developer's request and shall file a detailed list and report, in writing, with the
Township Council, and shall simultaneously send a copy thereof to the developer not later
than 45 days after receipt of the developer's request.
B. The list prepared by the Municipal Engineer shall state, in detail, with respect to each bonded
improvement determined to be incomplete or unsatisfactory, the nature and extent of the
incompleteness of each incomplete bonded improvement or the nature and extent of, and
remedy for, the unsatisfactory state of each completed bonded improvement determined to be
unsatisfactory. The report prepared by the Municipal Engineer shall identify each bonded
improvement determined to be complete and satisfactory together with a recommendation as
to the amount of reduction to be made in the performance guarantee relating to the completed
and satisfactory bonded improvement, in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
provided to the Municipal Engineer in accordance with §902.A.
C. The Township Council, by resolution, shall either approve the bonded improvements
determined to be complete and satisfactory by the Municipal Engineer, or reject any or all of
these bonded improvements upon the establishment in the resolution of cause for rejection,
and shall approve and authorize the amount of reduction to be made in the performance
guarantee relating to the improvements accepted, in accordance with the itemized cost
estimate provided to the Municipal Engineer in accordance with § 902.A. This resolution
shall be adopted not later than 45 days after receipt of the list and report prepared by the
Municipal Engineer. Upon adoption of the resolution by the Township Council, the
developer shall be released from all liability pursuant to its performance guarantee, with
respect to those approved bonded improvements, except for that portion adequately sufficient
to secure completion or correction of the improvements not yet approved; provided that 30%
of the amount of the total performance guarantee and safety and stabilization guarantee
posted may be retained to ensure completion and acceptability of all bonded improvements.
The safety and stabilization guarantee shall be reduced by the same percentage as the
performance guarantee is being reduced at the time of each performance guarantee reduction.
For the purpose of releasing the developer from liability pursuant to its performance
guarantee, the amount of the performance guarantee attributable to each approved bonded
improvement shall be reduced by the total amount for each such improvement, in accordance
with the itemized cost estimate which formed the basis of the performance guaranty and
appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to § 902.A, including any contingency
factor applied to the cost of installation. If the sum of the approved bonded improvements
would exceed 70% of the total amount of the performance guarantee, then the municipality
may retain 30% of the amount of the total performance guarantee and safety and
stabilization guarantee to ensure completion and acceptability of bonded improvements, as
provided above, except that any amount of the performance guarantee attributable to bonded
improvements for which a temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee has been posted
shall be released from the performance guarantee even if such release would reduce the
amount held by the municipality below 30%.
D. If the Municipal Engineer fails to send or provide the list and report as requested by the
developer pursuant to §907.A. within 45 days from receipt of the request, the developer may
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
395
apply to the court in a summary manner for an order compelling the Municipal Engineer to
provide the list and report within a stated time and the cost of applying to the court, including
reasonable attorney's fees, may be awarded to the prevailing party.
E. If the Township Council fails to approve or reject the improvements determined by the
Municipal Engineer to be complete and satisfactory or reduce the performance guarantee for
the complete and satisfactory improvements within 45 days from the receipt of the Municipal
Engineer's list and report, the developer may apply to the court in a summary manner for an
order compelling, within a stated time, approval of the complete and satisfactory
improvements and approval of a reduction in the performance guarantee for the approvable
complete and satisfactory improvements in accordance with the itemized cost estimate
prepared by the Municipal Engineer and appended to the performance guarantee pursuant to
§902.A; and the cost of applying to the court, including reasonable attorney's fees, may be
awarded to the prevailing party.
F. In the event that the developer has made a cash deposit with the Township or approving
authority as part of the performance guarantee, then any partial reduction granted in the
performance guarantee pursuant to this subsection shall be applied to the cash deposit in the
same proportion as the original cash deposit bears to the full amount of the performance
guarantee.
G. If any portion of the required improvements is rejected, the approving authority may require
the developer to complete or correct such improvements and, upon completion or correction,
the same procedure of notification, as set forth in this section shall be followed.
H. Nothing herein, however, shall be construed to limit the right of the developer to contest by
legal proceedings any determination of the Township Council or the Municipal Engineer.
I. The developer shall reimburse the municipality for all reasonable inspection fees paid to the
Municipal Engineer for the foregoing inspection of improvements, which fees shall not
exceed the sum of the amount set forth in N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53. The municipality may require
the developer to post the inspection fees in escrow in an amount calculated as follows: (a)
except for extraordinary circumstances, the greater of $500 or 5% of the cost of the
improvement subject to a performance guarantee; plus (b) an amount not to exceed 5% of the
cost of the private site improvements not subject to a performance guarantee, which cost
shall be determined pursuant to N.J.S.A. 40:55D-53.4.
If the Township determines that the amount in escrow for the payment of inspection fees, as
calculated herein, is insufficient to cover the cost of additional required inspections, the
Township may require the developer to deposit additional funds in escrow provided that the
Township delivers to the developer a written inspection escrow deposit request which
informs the developer of the need for additional inspections, details the items or undertakings
that require inspection, estimates the time required for those inspections, and estimates the
cost of performing those inspections.
J. In the event that final approval is by stages or sections of development pursuant to N.J.S.A.
40:55D-38, the provisions of this section shall be applied by stage or section.
K. In the event that the developer shall seek a temporary certificate of occupancy for a
development, unit, lot, building, or phase of development, as a condition of the issuance
thereof, the developer shall furnish a separate guarantee, referred to herein as a temporary
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
396
certificate of occupancy guarantee in favor of the Township of Lawrence in an amount
equal to 120% of the cost of installation of only those improvements or items which remain
to be completed or installed under the terms of the temporary certificate of occupancy and
which are required to be installed or completed as a condition precedent to the issuance of
the permanent certificate of occupancy for the development, unit, lot, building or phase of
development and which are not covered by an existing performance guarantee. Upon posting
of a temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee, all sums remaining under a performance
guarantee, required pursuant to this Chapter, that relate to the development, unit, lot,
building, or phase of development for which the temporary certificate of occupancy is
sought, shall be released.
The scope and amount of the temporary certificate of occupancy guarantee shall be
determined by the Municipal Engineer, and shall include any incomplete improvements as
required by the approval of the Board of jurisdiction. The temporary certificate of
occupancy guarantee shall be released by the Municipal Engineer upon the issuance of a
permanent certificate of occupancy with regard to the development, unit, lot, building, or
phase as to which the temporary certificate of occupancy relates.
L. If the property or any part of same is sold, or otherwise conveyed to a successor developer
prior to the completion and acceptance of all improvements, an Assignment of Developers
Agreement, and new performance, maintenance or other guarantees shall be required from
the new owner or successor developer. Upon the transfer of ownership of property that is the
subject of a construction permit, and prior to beginning or continuing work authorized by the
construction permit, the new owner or successor developer shall file with the building
department an application for a permit update to notify the building department of the name
and address of the new owner or successor developer and of all other changes to information
previously submitted to the building department. The building department shall not approve
the application for a permit update until it receives notification from the governing body or
its designee that the new owner or successor developer has furnished adequate replacement
performance, maintenance or other guarantees and Assignment of Developers Agreement.
§ 908 Conditions for Acceptance of Improvements;
Maintenance Guarantee.
The approval of any plat under this Article by the approving Board or Township Council, or both,
shall in no way be construed as acceptance of any street or drainage system or any other improvement
required by this Ordinance, nor shall such plat approval obligate the Township in any way to
maintain or exercise jurisdiction over such street or drainage system or other improvement. No
improvement shall be accepted by the Township Council unless and until all of the following
conditions have been met.
A. The Municipal Engineer shall have certified in writing that the improvements are complete
and that they comply with the requirements of this Ordinance.
B. The final plat shall have been approved by the Board.
C. Maintenance Guarantee.
1. After final acceptance of all improvements, the developer shall have filed with the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
397
Township Council a maintenance guarantee in an amount equal to not more than
15% of the original estimate of the cost of installing the improvements and shall run
for a period not exceeding two years. The procedures and requirements governing
such maintenance guarantee shall be identical with the procedures and requirements
for a performance guarantee set forth in this Article. The requirements for a
maintenance guarantee may be waived by the Township Council only if the
Township Engineer has certified that the improvements have been in continuous use
for not less than two years from the date the Township Engineer certified
completion of such improvements and that during this period the developer has
maintained the improvements in a satisfactory manner.
2. In the event that any other Township or governmental agencies or public utilities
automatically will own the utilities to be installed, or the improvements are covered
by a performance or maintenance guarantee to another municipal or governmental
agency, no performance or maintenance guarantee, as the case may be, shall be
required by the Township for such utilities or improvements.
D. Acceptance of Publicly Dedicated Streets. A publicly dedicated street shall be deemed
accepted by the municipality when the governing body grants full release of the performance
guarantee and acceptance of the maintenance guarantee.
E. Acceptance of Street Lighting on Publicly Dedicated Streets. The Township shall accept
responsibility for the costs of street lighting on publicly dedicated streets within 30 days
upon written notice when the following conditions have been fulfilled by the developer:
1. The street lights have been connected to a public utility;
2. The street lights have been installed and accepted for service by the public utility;
and
3. Certificates of occupancy have been issued for at least 50% of the dwelling units and
50% of the floor area of the non-residential uses by section or phase of development.
Compliance by the municipality with the provisions of this subsection shall not be deemed to
constitute acceptance of the street by the Township.
§ 909 Issuance of Certificate of Occupancy.
A. Occupancy permits for any buildings will be issued only when the installation of any curbs,
all utilities, all functioning water supply and sewage treatment facilities, all necessary storm
drainage to ensure proper drainage of the lot and surrounding land, rough grading of lots,
final course for the driveway and base course for the streets, unless formally waived by the
Municipal Engineer, are installed to serve the lot and structure for which the permit is
requested.
B. Streets, if installed prior to final approval, shall not be paved until all heavy construction is
complete; shade trees shall not be planted until all grading and earthmoving is completed;
and seeding of grass areas shall be the last operation.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
398
§ 910 As-Built Plan Requirements.
A. As-built plans shall be presented to the Municipal Engineer before improvements may be
inspected. No Certificate of Occupancy shall be issued unless an as-built plan is submitted
and approved by the Municipal Engineer.
B. An as-built plan shall be submitted which indicates the constructed conditions and/or
location of:
1. Final grading;
2. Roads including curbing and sidewalks;
3. Utilities;
4. Building location;
5. Driveways and parking lots;
6. Stormwater management facilities, including as-built topographic contours and
volume calculations;
7. Walls and fences; and
8. Other structures deemed pertinent by the Municipal Engineer.
C. As-built plans shall be submitted by a New Jersey licensed land surveyor in the form of three
prints.
§ 911 Off-Tract Improvements.
A. Payment of Pro Rata Share. The Board of Jurisdiction shall require as a condition of final
subdivision or final site plan approval that the applicant pay for his or her pro rata share of
providing off-tract improvements, including the acquisition of land and easements,
necessitated or required by the approved development. The applicant shall either install the
necessary off-tract improvements or pay the pro rata share to the municipality at the option
of Lawrence Township. Such off-tract improvements shall be clearly, directly and
substantially related to the approved development.
B. Improvements to be Constructed at the Sole Expense of the Applicant. In cases where the
need for an off-tract improvement is created by the proposed subdivision or site plan and
where no other property owners receive a special benefit thereby or where no planned capital
improvement by a governmental entity is contemplated, the applicant shall be solely
responsible for the cost and installation of the required improvements.
C. Other Improvements.
1. In cases where the need for any off-tract improvement is created by the proposed
subdivision or site plan and where the Board of Jurisdiction determines that
properties outside the subdivision or tract will also be benefited by the improvement,
the Board shall forward to the Township Council a list and description of all such
improvements together with its request that the Township Council determine and
advise the Board of the procedure to be followed in its construction or installation.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
399
The Board shall defer final action upon the subdivision or site plan until receipt of
the Township Council's determination or until the expiration of 30 days after the
forwarding of such list and description to the Township Council without such
determination having been made, whichever occurs sooner.
2. The Township Council, within 30 days after receipt of said list and description, shall
determine and advise the Board whether:
a. The improvement or improvements are to be constructed or installed by the
municipality:
(1) As a general improvement, the cost of which is to be borne at
general capital improvement (except as otherwise provided as a
contribution by the applicant); or
(2) As a local improvement, all or part of the cost of which is to be
specially assessed against properties benefited thereby in
proportion to benefits conferred by the improvements in
accordance with N.J.S.A. 40:56 (except as otherwise provided as a
contribution by the applicant); or
b. The improvement or improvements are to be constructed or installed by the
applicant under a formula for partial reimbursement as hereinafter set forth.
3. If the Township Council determines that the improvement or improvements shall be
constructed or installed as a general capital improvement, the Municipal Engineer
shall estimate the amount, if any, by which the total cost thereof will exceed the total
amount by which all properties, including the subject tract, will be specially
benefited thereby, and the applicant shall be liable to the municipality for such
excess. The Township Council shall adopt an ordinance authorizing and providing
for the financing of the capital improvement or improvements in a manner consistent
with the obligation of the applicant for any difference in the total cost over total
benefits conferred.
4. If the Township Council determines that the improvement or improvements shall be
constructed or installed as a benefit assessment, the Municipal Engineer shall
estimate the difference between the total costs to be incurred and the total amount by
which all properties, including the subject tract, will be specifically benefited by the
improvement. The applicant shall be liable to the municipality for the difference in
total cost over total benefits occurred as well as for the amount of any special
assessments against the subdivision property or tract for benefits conferred by the
improvement or improvements. The Township Council shall adopt an ordinance
authorizing and providing for the financing of the improvement or improvements
and the assessment of benefits arising in a manner consistent with the obligation of
the applicant. The Township Council shall proceed in accordance with N.J.S.A.
40:56, except to the extent modified by the obligation of the applicant for any excess
of total costs over total benefits conferred.
D. Cost Allocation. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the municipality and
applicant from agreeing to use a different method of allocating cost.
E. Costs Included. The cost of an improvement shall be construed to encompass all costs
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §900-911
400
related to such improvement, including, but not limited to, planning, feasibility studies,
surveying, permit acquisition, property and easement acquisition, design, construction, and
inspection of a project.
F. Performance Guarantee. The applicant shall be required to provide, as a condition for final

administrative agent shall have all of responsibilities as put forth in this rule. After the initial
sales and rental transactions, the Administrator shall monitor, if such person is not the
municipality's Administrative Agent, the activities of the Administrative Agent for any resales

or during the transition. The Administrative Agent's enforcement responsibility for
implementing such practices and procedures shall not be delegated or otherwise
transferred to any other party, except to a successor administrative agent.

of the NJ Department of Community Affairs or its successor agency, the Township of
Lawrence shall be deemed to have delegated to the Administrative Agent the day-to-day
responsibility for implementing practices and procedures designated to ensure effective
compliance with the controls set forth in this Article. The governing body of the municipality,
however, shall retain the ultimate responsibility for ensuring effective compliance with the
requirements as set forth in UHAC and any settlement agreements pertaining to affordable

§ 1004 Household Income Limitations.
A. The incomes of low and moderate-income households occupying affordable housing shall
not exceed the income limits as of January 1 of the current year.
B. Median Income Determination. Income limits for all units for which income limits are not
already established through a federal program exempted from the Uniform Housing
Affordability Controls pursuant to N.J.A.C.5:80-26.1 shall be updated by the Township
annually within 30 days of the publication of determinations of median income by the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as follows:
1. Regional income limits shall be established for the region based on the median
income by household size, which shall be established by a regional weighted
average of the uncapped Section 8 income limits published by HUD. To compute
this regional income limit, the HUD determination of median county income for a
family of four is multiplied by the estimated households within the county according
to the most recent decennial Census. The resulting product for each county within
the housing region is summed. The sum is divided by the estimated total households
from the most recent decennial Census in Region 4. This quotient represents the
regional weighted average of median income for a household of four. The income
limit for a moderate-income unit for a household of four shall be 80% of the
regional weighted average median income for a family of four. The income limit for
a low-income unit for a household of four shall be 50% of the HUD determination
of the regional weighted average median income for a family of four. The income
limit for a very low income unit for a household of four shall be 30% of the regional
weighted average median income for a family of four. These income limits shall be
adjusted by household size based on multipliers used by HUD to adjust median
income by household size. In no event shall the income limits be less than those for
the previous year.
2. The income limits calculated each year shall be the result of applying the
percentages set forth in subparagraph -1 above to HUD's determination of median
income for the relevant fiscal year, and shall be utilized until the Township updates
the income limits after HUD has published revised determinations of median income
for the next fiscal year.
3. The Regional Asset Limit used in determining an applicant's eligibility for
affordable housing pursuant to N.J.A.C.5:80-26.16(b)3 shall be calculated by the
Township annually by taking the percentage increase of the income limits calculated
pursuant to subparagraph -1 above over the previous years income limits, and
applying the same percentage increase to the Regional Asset Limit from the prior
year. In no event shall the Regional Asset Limit be less than that for the previous
year.
C. Affordable Housing Purchase or Rent. Very low income housing units shall be reserved
for households with a gross household income less than or equal to 30% of the median
regional income. Very low income households shall be considered a subset of low income
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
407
units. Of the number of very low income households, at least 50% shall be for family
households. Low income housing units shall be reserved for households with a gross
household income less than or equal to 50% of the median regional income. Moderate income
units shall be reserved for households with a gross household income more than 50% but
equal to or less than 80% of the median income.
D. Assisted Living Facilities. Income determination and eligibility for assisted living facilities
shall also comply with the New Jersey Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency's Assisted
Living Underwriting Guidelines and Financing Policy, dated May 28, 1996, as it may be
amended or superseded. The monthly fee for rent, meals, and basic services for the
affordable units in the assisted living facility shall not exceed 80% of household income.
For the purposes of this section, 62.5% of the fee shall be assumed to be for meals and
basic services and 37.5% of the fee for rent.
§ 1005 Household Income Verification.
A. The Administrative Agent shall secure all information from applicant households necessary
and appropriate to determine that restricted dwellings are occupied by properly sized
households with appropriate very low, low or moderate-income levels. No household may
be referred to a restricted dwelling, or may receive a commitment with respect to a
restricted dwelling, unless that household has received a signed and dated certification, as
set forth in this section, and has executed the certificate in the form provided.
B. The Administrative Agent shall use a random selection process to select occupants of very
low, low and moderate-income housing.
C. The Administrative Agent shall prepare a standard form of certification and shall sign and
date one for each household when certified. This certification shall be known as a Certificate
of Eligibility and shall be a prerequisite for the purchase or rental of an income-restricted
dwelling. An initial certification shall be valid for no more than 180 days unless a valid
contract for sale or lease has been executed within that time period. In this event, certifications
shall be valid until such time as the contract for sale or lease is ruled invalid and no occupancy
has occurred. Certifications may be renewed in writing at the request of a certified household
for an additional period of 180 days at the discretion of the Administrator or Administrative
Agent.
D. When reviewing an applicant households income to determine eligibility, the Administrator
or Administrative Agent shall compare the applicant households total gross annual income
to the regional very low, low and moderate income limits then in effect, as approved by
the court of competent jurisdiction. For the purposes of this subchapter, income includes, but
is not limited to, wages, salaries, tips, commissions, alimony, regularly scheduled overtime,
pensions, social security, unemployment compensation, Temporary Assistance for Needy
Families (TANF), verified regular child support, disability, net income from business or
real estate, and income from assets such as savings, certificates of deposit, money market
accounts, mutual funds, stocks, bonds and imputed income from non-income producing
assets, such as equity in real estate.
E. Except as otherwise specifically stated in this subchapter, the sources of income considered
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
408
by the Administrator or Administrative Agent shall be the types of regular income reported
to the Internal Revenue Service and which is eligible to be used for mortgage loan
approval. Household annual gross income shall be calculated by projecting current gross
income over a 12-month period.
F. Assets not earning a verifiable income shall have an annual imputed interest income using
a current average annual savings interest rate. Assets not earning income include, but are
not limited to, present real estate equity. Applicants owning real estate shall produce
documentation of a market value appraisal and outstanding mortgage debt. The difference
shall be treated as the monetary value of the asset and the imputed interest added to income. If
the applicant household owns a primary residence with no mortgage on the property valued
at or above the regional asset limit, a Certificate of Eligibility shall be denied by the
Administrator or Administrative Agent, unless the applicants existing monthly housing
costs (including principal, interest, taxes, homeowner and private mortgage insurance, and
condominium and homeowner association fees as applicable) exceed 33% of the
households eligible monthly income.
G. Rent from real estate shall be considered income, after deduction of any mortgage
payments, real estate taxes, property owners insurance and reasonable property
management expenses as reported to the Internal Revenue Service. Other expenses are not
deductible. If actual rent is less than fair market rent, the Administrator or Administrative
Agent shall impute a fair market rent.
H. Income does not include benefits, payments, rebates or credits received under any of
the following:
1. Federal or State low income energy assistance programs;
2. Food stamps, payments received for foster care, relocation assistance benefits;
3. Income of live-in attendants, scholarships, student loans, and personal property,
including but not limited to, automobiles; and
4. Lump-sum additions to assets such as inheritances, lottery winnings, gifts,
insurance settlements, and part-time income of persons enrolled as full-time students.
5. Income, however, does include interest and other earnings from the investment of
any of the foregoing benefits, payments, rebates, or credits.
I. The Administrative Agent shall require each member of an applicant household who is 18
years of age or older to provide documentation to verify the members income,
including income received by adults on behalf of minor children for their benefit. Household
members 18 years of age or older who do not receive income must produce documentation of
current status. Income verification documentation may include, but is not limited to, the
following for each and every member of a household who is 18 years of age or older:
1. Four consecutive pay stubs, not more than 120 days old, including bonuses, overtime
or tips, or a letter from the employer stating the present annual income figure;
2. Copies of Federal and State income tax returns for each of the preceding three
tax years;
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
409
3. A letter or appropriate reporting form verifying monthly benefits such as Social
Security, unemployment, TANF, disability or pension income (monthly or annually);
4. A letter or appropriate reporting form verifying any other sources of income claimed
by the applicant, such as alimony or child support;
5. Income reports from banks or other financial institutions holding or managing
trust funds, money market accounts, certificates of deposit, stocks or bonds; and
6. Evidence or reports of income from directly held assets such as real estate or
businesses.
7. Court ordered payments for alimony or child support to another household, whether
or not it is being paid regularly, shall be excluded from income for purposes of
determining income eligibility.
J. At the discretion of the Administrator or Administrative Agent, households may also be
required to produce documentation of household composition for determining the correct
dwelling size and applicable median income guide.
K. Tenant Income Eligibility. In addition to the foregoing requirements, tenant income
eligibility shall be in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.13 and the following determinations:
1. Median Income Limits:
a. Very low-income rental units shall be reserved for households with a gross
household income less than or equal to 30% of the regional median
household income by household size.
b. Low-income rental units shall be reserved for households with a gross
household income less than or equal to 50% of the regional median
household income by household size.
c. Moderate-income rental units shall be reserved for households with a gross
household income less than 80% of the regional median household income
by household size.
2. The Administrative Agent shall certify a household as eligible for a restricted rental
unit when the household is a very low-income, low-income household or a
moderate-income household, as applicable to the unit, and the rent proposed for the
unit does not exceed 35% (40% for age-restricted units) of the households eligible
monthly income as determined pursuant to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.16, as may be amended
and supplemented; provided, however, that this limit may be exceeded if one or
more of the following circumstances exists:
a. The household currently pays more than 35% (40% for households eligible

Agent and the owner of the unit.
3. The applicant shall file documentation sufficient to establish the existence of the
circumstances in -2.a through -2.e above with the Administrative Agent, who shall
counsel the household on budgeting.
§ 1006 Certificate of Eligibility, Waiting List and Selection
A. If the household is found to be eligible for low and moderate- income housing, they shall
be issued a Certificate of Eligibility and placed on the affordable housing waiting list, except
in the event that such a certificate is withheld or removed in accordance with this section.
Eligible persons that live or work within the East Central Housing Region (Region 4) shall

be removed from the list.
H. All applications shall be notarized and certified complete and accurate. Anyone
knowingly submitting incomplete, inaccurate, incorrect or false information may be
removed from eligibility for very low, low and moderate income dwellings. All
information submitted to the Administrator or Administrative Agent for the purposes of
determining applicant eligibility shall be strictly confidential and not considered a public
record.
I. Prior to the time of availability of a very low, low and moderate income dwelling, the
Administrator or Administrative Agent shall notify by certified mail the top three households
on the waiting list for the type of dwelling available, its location and the estimated date it
will be available. If a purchaser or tenant cannot be found from the top three
households on the waiting list, notice shall be sent to the fourth, fifth, etc., household until
a purchaser or tenant is found. The household shall, within 14 days of mailing, notify
the Administrator or Administrative Agent, in writing, of its intent to occupy the dwelling
and, if selected, its intent to comply with the requirements of paragraph J, below, within
15 days. Any household which fails to respond to the notice or chooses to reject a specific
dwelling by informing the Administrative Agent in writing, shall retain its priority and shall
be notified of available dwellings in the future, except that if a household chooses to
reject a dwelling or fails to respond three times, it shall be removed from the list and

and if the household notifies the Administrative Agent of its intent to occupy the dwelling
and that household is selected for occupancy, each household member shall update the
records on file and recertify the accuracy of the information as required herein. Information
shall be reviewed and the eligibility status reconfirmed. The household selected shall only
at that point proceed to make the legal and financial arrangements to acquire or lease the
dwelling.
K. If a household selected for occupancy is unable to obtain financing, it shall lose its
eligibility for that dwelling, after notice, but shall retain its priority status for a similar
appropriate dwelling as other dwellings become available and as long as the household

as a result of an applicants inability to verify funds claimed as assets, household
composition or other facts represented.

homeowner and private mortgage insurance and condominium or homeowner
association fees do not exceed 28% of the eligible monthly income of the

moderate income units may increase annually based on the percentage increase in
the regional median income limit for each housing region. In no event shall the
maximum resale price established by the administrative agent be lower than the
last recorded purchase price.
4. Rental dwellings annual increase. The rent of low and moderate income units may
be increased annually based on the percentage increase in the Housing Consumer
Price Index for the United States. This increase shall not exceed 9% in any one
year. Rents for units constructed pursuant to low income housing tax credit
regulations shall be indexed pursuant to the regulations governing low income
housing tax credits.

neither an owner nor a lender shall at any time cause or permit the total
indebtedness secured by a restricted ownership dwelling to exceed 95% of the
maximum allowable resale price of that dwelling, as such price is determined by the
Administrator in accordance with N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.6(b).
F. Capital Improvements to Ownership Units.
1. The owners of restricted ownership units may apply to the Administrator to increase
the maximum sales price for the dwelling on the basis of capital improvements
made since the purchase of the dwelling. Eligible capital improvements shall be
those that render the dwelling suitable for a larger household or that adds an
additional bathroom. In no event shall the maximum sales price of an improved
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
417
housing dwelling exceed the limits of affordability for the larger household.
2. Upon the resale of a restricted ownership dwelling, all items of property that are
permanently affixed to the dwelling or were included when the dwelling was
initially restricted (for example, refrigerator, range, washer, dryer, dishwasher, wallto-
wall carpeting) shall be included in the maximum allowable resale price. Other
items may be sold to the purchaser at a reasonable price that has been approved
by the Administrator at the time of the signing of the agreement to purchase. The
purchase of central air conditioning installed subsequent to the initial sale of the
dwelling and not included in the base price may be made a condition of the
dwelling resale provided the price, which shall be subject to 10-year, straight-line
depreciation, has been approved by the Administrator. Unless otherwise approved
by the Administrator, the purchase of any property other than central air
conditioning shall not be made a condition of the dwelling resale. The owner and
the purchaser must personally certify at the time of closing that no unapproved
transfer of funds for the purpose of selling and receiving property has taken place
at the time of or as a condition of resale.
G. Notice of Resale, Recapture Covenant and 95/5 Purchase Options.
1. The owner of the property is required to notify the Administrator by certified mail of
any intent to sell the property 90 days prior to entering into an agreement for the

affordability controls on restricted units in effect at the time the Property was first
restricted as part of the Affordable Housing Program.
2. The municipal housing inspector shall inspect the available affordable resale unit
for construction and property maintenance code violation(s). The housing inspector

the owner will be determined by estimator(s) and/or contractor(s) supplied by the
Administrator and charged back to the seller.
3. Upon the first such non-exempt sale of the Property, 95% of the difference between,
(i), the actual sale price; and (ii), the regulated maximum sales price that would be
applicable were the period of affordability controls on restricted units still in
effect, shall be paid at closing to the Township of Lawrence; or, to the NJ
Department of Community Affairs or NJ Housing and Mortgage Finance Agency,
when acting as receiving agent for the municipality. Exempt sales shall be as listed
in §1012.

foreclosure will be turned over to the municipality to be used for low and moderate-income
housing.
§ 1013 Leasing Restriction.

principal residence. RENTAL OR SUBLEASING OF THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNIT
IS EXPRESSLY FORBIDDEN.
§ 1014 Effect on Landlord and Tenant Relationship.

Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
421
occupying a dwelling under this Article and subject to the regulations of the Township
of Lawrence is subject to eviction for any reasons allowed under applicable New Jersey
law. The provisions of this Article are not intended to confer any additional rights or
obligations on property owners or tenants other than those mandated by statute or required
by the courts of the State of New Jersey or the duly adopted regulations of any of its
agencies.
§ 1015 Affirmative Marketing for Affordable Housing
A. Purpose. The purpose of this Section is to establish administrative procedures to ensure a
wide dissemination of knowledge of affordable housing units as they become available to
the low and moderate-income population, and that the selection of tenants or homeowners, as
the case may be, meets the requirements of the Uniform Housing Affordability Controls.
B. An Affirmative Marketing Plan is a regional marketing strategy designed to attract
buyers and/or renters of all majority and minority groups, regardless of race, creed, color,
national origin, ancestry, marital, or familial status, gender, affectional or sexual orientation,
disability, age or number of children to housing units which are being marketed by a
developer or sponsor of affordable housing. An Affirmative Marketing Plan is also
intended to target those potentially eligible persons who are least likely to apply for
affordable units in that region.
C. Affirmative Marketing Requirements. Within the overall framework of the municipalitys
affirmative marketing program, all affordable housing units in Lawrence Township shall
be marketed in accordance with the provisions in this Section unless otherwise provided
for in N.J.A.C. 5:80-26-1. An Affirmative Marketing Plan shall be created for each
development that contains or will contain low and moderate income units, including those
that are part of the Townships prior round Housing Element and its current Housing
Element and those that may be constructed in future developments not yet anticipated. This
Affirmative Marketing Plan shall also apply to any rehabilitated units that are vacated
and re-rented during the applicable period of controls for rehabilitated rental units when
Lawrence is allocated a rehabilitation component.
D. Plan Preparation. The Administrator or Administrative Agent shall prepare an Affirmative
Marketing Plan for each affordable housing program, as applicable, comporting with
N.J.A.C. 5:80-26.15, for review and approval by the Affordable Housing Board. The
Administrator of the Township shall oversee the work of a developers Administrative Agent
provided that the person has been approved by the Affordable Housing Board.
Regardless of the drafting agent, the Affirmative Marketing Plan is intended to be used
by developers of affordable housing restricted to low and moderate income households
located within the municipality. The Administrative Agent responsible for specific
affordable housing programs or developments shall ensure that the affirmative marketing
of all affordable units is consistent with these provisions.
E. Affirmative Marketing Implementation. The Affirmative Marketing Plan includes regulations
for qualification of income eligibility, price and rent restrictions, bedroom distribution,
affordability control periods, and unit marketing in accordance to N.J.A.C. 5:80-26. All
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
422
newly created affordable units will comply with the thirty-year affordability control required
by UHAC, N.J.A.C. 5:80-26-5 and 5:80-26-11. This plan will be adhered to by all private,
non-profit or municipal developers of affordable housing units and will cover the period of
deed restriction or affordability controls on each affordable unit. The Affirmative
Marketing Plan for each affordable housing development shall meet the following minimum
requirements:
1. The Affirmative Marketing Plan shall provide a regional preference for all
households that live and/or work in Housing Region 4, comprised of Mercer,
Monmouth and Ocean Counties.
2. Although the Township has the ultimate responsibility for implementing all
aspects of Lawrences affordable housing program, the Administrative Agent
designated by the Affordable Housing Board shall assure that the affirmative
marketing of all affordable units is consistent with the Affirmative Marketing Plan
for the municipality.
3. The Administrative Agent shall provide a list of counseling services to low and
moderate- income applicants on subjects such as budgeting, credit issues,
mortgage qualification, rental lease requirements, and landlord/tenant law.
4. The affirmative marketing process for available affordable units shall begin at
least four months prior to the expected date of occupancy. Advertising and
outreach shall take place during the first week of the marketing program and each
month thereafter until all of the affordable units have been leased or sold.
5. The costs of advertising and affirmative marketing of the affordable units shall be
the responsibility of the developer, sponsor or owner, unless otherwise determined
or agreed to by the Township of Lawrence.
6. The Affirmative Marketing Plan for each affordable housing development shall
describe the media to be used in advertising and publicizing the availability
of housing. In implementing the Affirmative Marketing Plan, the Administrative
Agent shall consider the use of language translations where appropriate.
7. Applications for affordable housing shall be available in several locations,
including, at a minimum, the County Administration Building and/or the
County Library for each county within the housing region; the municipal
administration building and the municipal library in Lawrence; and the
developer's rental office. Applications shall be mailed to prospective applicants
upon request.
8. The Administrator shall develop, maintain and update a list of community contact
person(s) and/or organizations(s) in the Region 4 Housing Area for the use of
the Township and other Administrative Agents. This list shall be updated
periodically. The list shall contain organizations that will aid in the affirmative
marketing program with particular emphasis on contacts with outreach to groups
and individuals that are least likely to apply for affordable housing within the
region. A representative sample of the organizations on the list shall be contacted
as part of the affirmative marketing effort as approved by the Administrator.

9. The Affirmative Marketing Plan shall be approved by the Affordable Housing
Board pursuant to §1003 prior to implementation.
§ 1016 Violations of Article X Regulations.
A. Upon the occurrence of a breach of any of the regulations governing the affordable dwelling
by an owner, developer or tenant the municipality shall have all remedies provided at law or
equity, including but not limited to foreclosure, tenant eviction, municipal fines, a
requirement for household recertification, acceleration of all sums due under a mortgage,
recoupment of any funds from a sale in the violation of the regulations, injunctive relief to
prevent further violation of the regulations, entry on the premises, and specific performance.
B. After providing written notice of a violation to an owner, developer or tenant of a low or
moderate income dwelling and advising the owner, developer or tenant of the penalties for
such violations, the municipality may take the following action against the owner,
developer or tenant for any violation that remains uncured for a period of 60 days after
service of the written notice:
1. The municipality may file a court action pursuant to N.J.S.A. 2A:58-11 alleging a
violation, or violations, of the regulations governing the affordable housing unit. If
the owner, developer or tenant is found by the court to have violated any
provision of the regulations governing affordable housing units the owner,
developer or tenant shall be subject to one or more of the following penalties, at the
discretion of the court:
a. A fine of not more than $1,000.00 or imprisonment for a period not to
exceed 90 days, or both. Each and every day that the violation continues or
exists shall be considered a separate and specific violation of these
provisions and not as a continuing offense;
b. In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low or moderate income
dwelling in violation of the regulations governing affordable housing units,
payment into the Township of Lawrences Affordable Housing Trust Fund
of the gross amount of rent illegally collected;
c. In the case of an owner who has rented his or her low or moderate income
unit in violation of the regulations governing affordable housing units,
payment of an innocent tenant's reasonable relocation costs, as determined
by the court.
2. The municipality may file a court action in the Superior Court seeking a judgment,
which would result in the termination of the Owner's equity or other interest in the
dwelling, in the nature of a mortgage foreclosure. Any judgment shall be
enforceable as if the same were a judgment of default of the first purchase money
mortgage and shall constitute a lien against the low and moderate-income unit.
3. Such judgment shall be enforceable, at the option of the municipality, by means of
an execution sale by the County Sheriff, at which time the low and moderate
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
424
income unit of the violating owner shall be sold at a sale price which is not less
than the amount necessary to fully satisfy and pay off any first purchase money
mortgage and prior liens and the costs of the enforcement proceedings incurred by
the municipality, including attorney's fees. The violating owner shall have the right
to possession terminated as well as the title conveyed pursuant to the Sheriff's sale.
C. The proceeds of the Sheriff's sale shall first be applied to satisfy the first purchase money
mortgage lien upon the dwelling and any prior liens on the dwelling. The excess, if any,
shall be applied to reimburse the Township for any and all costs and expenses incurred in
connection with either the court action resulting in the judgment of violation or the sheriff's
sale. In the event that the proceeds from the Sheriff's sale are insufficient to reimburse the
Township in full as aforesaid, the violating owner shall be personally responsible for the
deficiency, in addition to any and all costs incurred by the Township in connection with
collecting said deficiency. The remainder, if any, up to a maximum of the amount the
owner would be entitled to if he or she were to sell the dwelling as permitted by N.J.S.A.
5:80-26.1 et seq., shall be placed in escrow by the Township for the owner and shall be held
in such escrow for a period of two years or until such time as the owner shall make a claim
with the Township for the same. Failure of the owner to claim said sum within the two-year
period shall automatically result in a forfeiture of said remainder to the municipality and
paid into the Affordable Housing Trust Fund. Any interest accrued or earned on the
remainder while being held in escrow shall belong to and shall be paid to the Lawrence
Township Affordable Housing Fund whether the remainder is paid to the owner or forfeited
to the Township. Any excess funds derived over and above the sum due the owner shall be
paid over to the Township's Affordable Housing Trust Fund.
D. Foreclosure by the municipality due to violation of the regulations governing affordable
housing units shall not extinguish the restrictions of the regulations governing affordable
housing units as the same apply to the low and moderate income unit. Title shall be
conveyed to the purchaser at the Sheriff's sale, subject to the restrictions and provisions of
the regulations governing the affordable housing dwelling. The owner determined to be in
violation of the provisions of this plan and from whom title and possession were taken by
means of the Sheriff's sale shall not be entitled to any right of redemption.
E. If there are no bidders at the Sheriff's sale, or if insufficient amounts are bid to satisfy the
first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens, the municipality may acquire title to the
low and moderate income unit by satisfying the first purchase money mortgage and any
prior liens and crediting the violating owner with an amount equal to the difference
between the first purchase money mortgage and any prior liens and costs of the
enforcement proceedings, including legal fees and the maximum resale price for which the
low and moderate income unit could have been sold under the terms of the regulations
governing affordable housing units. This excess shall be treated in the same manner as the
excess which would have been realized from an actual sale as previously described.
F. Failure of the low and moderate income unit to be either sold at the Sheriff's sale or
acquired by the municipality shall obligate the owner to accept an offer to purchase from
any qualified purchaser which may be referred to the owner by the municipality, with such
offer to purchase being equal to the maximum resale price of the low and moderate income
unit as permitted by the regulations governing affordable housing units.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
425
G. The owner shall remain fully obligated, responsible and liable for complying with the terms
and restrictions of governing affordable housing units until such time as title is conveyed
from the owner.
H. Right to Cure. The Township may, at its option, advance and pay all sums necessary to
protect, preserve and retain the dwelling as an affordable dwelling, subject to the terms of
this Article. All sums so advanced and paid by the Township shall become a lien against said
dwelling and shall have a higher priority than any lien except the first purchase money
mortgage lien and liens by duly authorized government agencies. Such sums may include but
are not limited to insurance premiums, taxes, assessments (public or private) and costs of
repair necessary to bring the dwelling up to any and all applicable local, state or federal
codes and liens which may be or become prior and senior to any first purchase money
mortgage as a lien on the dwelling or any part thereof. If, in the event of a default or
nonpayment by the owner of an affordable dwelling, any first mortgagee or other creditor of
an owner of an affordable dwelling exercises its contractual or legal remedies available, the
owner shall notify the Administrative Agent and the Township Solicitor of the Township, in
writing, within 10 days of notification by the first mortgagee or creditor and no later than 10
days after service of any summons and complaint, and the Township shall have the option to
purchase, redeem or cure any default upon such terms and conditions as may be agreeable to
all parties in interest and/or to acquire the first purchase money mortgage to the dwelling,
thereby replacing the first mortgagee as the first mortgagee of the dwelling. The Township
shall have the same priority of lien as was held by the first mortgagee at the time the
Township acquires such first purchase money mortgage and shall have the right of
subrogation with respect to any other claim or lien it satisfies or acquires.
I. Provisions for First Purchase Money Mortgagees.
1. The terms and restrictions of this section shall be subordinate only to a first purchase
money mortgage lien on any affordable dwelling and in no way shall impair the first
mortgagee's ability to exercise the contract remedies available to it in the event of
default as set forth in the first purchase money mortgage. The first mortgagee and/or
mortgage servicer shall serve written notice upon the Township within 10 days after
the first purchase money mortgage is two months in arrears and again within 10
calendar days of the filing of a complaint seeking foreclosure of the first purchase
money mortgage held on an affordable dwelling. However, a judgment of
foreclosure upon the property shall in no instance terminate the conditions and
requirements of this Article maintaining the dwelling as an affordable, incomerestricted
residence.
2. The obligation of the first mortgagee and servicer to notify the Township shall cease
automatically and immediately upon the sale of the first purchase money mortgage
to the Federal National Mortgage Association or in the secondary mortgage market,
unless the rules and regulations or guidelines of the Federal National Mortgage
Association are amended so as to not prohibit or exclude placing such obligation
upon the holder of the mortgage or its service representative, in which case, an
instrument duly evidencing the same shall be recorded with the Register of Deeds,
Mercer County, New Jersey, before any such obligation shall exist. Provided that the
first mortgagee is obligated to give the Township the above-mentioned notices, the
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County 1000 -1012
426
first mortgagee shall also serve written notice of any proposed foreclosure sale upon
the Township at least 30 days prior to the first scheduled date of such sale. The first
mortgagee shall serve notice upon the Township within 30 days of the sale of the
first purchase money mortgage to the Federal National Mortgage Association or in
the secondary mortgage market.
3. The Township of Lawrence or any instrumentality designated by the Township shall
have the right to purchase any mortgage which is in default at any time prior to the
entry of a foreclosure judgment or within the redemption period thereafter.
Notification of a default and of the institution of a foreclosure action and of a
sheriff's sale shall be served, in writing, upon the Township Clerk and Municipal
Attorney. The Township of Lawrence shall at all times be considered a party in
interest and shall have the right to be joined as a party defendant and/or shall have
the right to intervene in any foreclosure action seeking foreclosure of a first
mortgage and/or shall have the right to redeem and acquire the owner's equity of
redemption or to acquire the dwelling from the owner upon such terms and
conditions as may be determined by the Township.
4. Surplus funds. In the event of a foreclosure sale by the holder of the first purchase
money mortgage, the owner shall be personally obligated to pay to the Township
any excess funds, but only to the extent that such excess funds exceed the difference
between what the owner could have resold his dwelling for under this Article at the
time of the foreclosure sale and the amount necessary to redeem and satisfy the first
purchase money mortgage debt, including costs of foreclosure and costs of repairs
necessary to bring the dwelling up to any and all applicable local, state or federal
codes. For the purposes of this subsection, excess funds shall be the total paid to the
sheriff in excess of the amount required to pay and satisfy the first purchase money
mortgage, including the costs of foreclosure, even if junior creditors actually receive
payment from said surplus funds to the exclusion of the owner. The Township is
hereby given a first priority lien, second only to the first mortgagee for any taxes or
public assessments by a duly authorized governmental body up to the full amount of
excess funds. This obligation of the owner to pay this full amount to the Township
shall be deemed to be a personal obligation of the owner of record at the time of the
foreclosure sale, and the Township is hereby empowered to enforce this obligation
in any appropriate court of law or equity as though the same were a personal
contractual obligation of the owner. Neither the first mortgagee nor the purchaser at
the foreclosure sale shall be responsible or liable to the Township for any portion of
this excess. The Township shall deposit any funds received in the Affordable
Housing Trust Fund and use it for the purposes as set forth in the Housing Element
and Fair Share Plan.

requires immediate and emergency repair to preserve the continued habitability of the landmark
and/or the health and safety of its occupants or others. Emergency repairs may be performed in
accordance with municipal codes, without the necessity of first obtaining the Historic Preservation
Advisory Committee's review. Under such circumstances, the repairs performed shall be only such
as are necessary to protect the health and safety of the occupants of the historic landmark, or others,
and/or to maintain the habitability of the structure. A request for the Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee's approval shall be made as soon as possible and no further work shall be performed upon
the structure until an appropriate request for approval is made and obtained in accordance with the
procedures set forth in this Ordinance. All work done under this section shall conform to the criteria

which is orally conveyed to the Board through the Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee's delegate at a hearing on the application.
B. Building Permit. For any building permit application affecting a historic landmark or an
improvement within a historic district, the construction official shall forward a copy of the

Lawrence Township, Mercer County §1100 - 1116
431
replacements affecting a historic landmark or an improvement within a historic district. The
Historic Preservation Advisory Committee shall provide a directive to the construction
official in accordance with §1107.
§ 1106 Review of Development Applications.
A. Completeness. Copies of development applications shall be reviewed by the Historic
Preservation Advisory Committee for completeness of the information received. Where
there is insufficient information, the application shall be returned to the referring body within
30 days of submission with specific written comments as to what information is needed for
the Historic Preservation Advisory Committee to render an opinion on the effect of the
project on historic landmarks.
B. Report Issuance. Where the information in the development application is sufficient to
render an opinion, the Historic Preservation Advisory Committee shall provide advice
through the preparation of a written report and oral testimony on the application by its
delegate at the referring body's public hearing. The Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee's recommendations shall focus on how the proposed undertaking would affect a
landmark's historic or architectural significance in light of the review criteria outlines in
§1109, §1110 and §1111 of this Ordinance.
C. Review by Board of Jurisdiction. In considering the Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee's recommendations, the Planning Board and Zoning Board of Adjustment shall
be guided by the review criteria established in §1109, §1110 and §1111.
§ 1107 Review of Permit Applications.
A. The Historic Preservation Advisory Committee shall devise all necessary forms for its
review and decision making actions.
B. The Historic Preservation Advisory Committee or its designee shall review the application
for technical completeness. Any application found to be incomplete shall be returned to the

Committee shall schedule a review of the application at is next regularly scheduled meeting.
The applicant shall be notified of the meeting date and shall be allowed an opportunity to
speak at the meeting.
D. The Historic Preservation Advisory Committee shall report to the construction official within
45 days of the receipt of a complete application. The report shall include a directive to
approve, deny, or conditionally approve the requested building permit and shall explain in
writing the reasons for the recommendation.
E. If an application involves demolition or removal, the Historic Preservation Advisory
Committee's directive shall specifically include whether the permit is to be denied or
postponed. If a postponement is imposed, the Historic Preservation Advisory Committee
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §1100 - 1116
432
shall work with the applicant during the postponement period to undertake such investigation
and take such actions as are necessary to consider alternatives to demolition.
F. If within the 45 day period, the Historic Preservation Advisory Committee recommends to
the construction official against the issuance of a permit or recommends conditions to the
permit to be issued, the construction official shall deny issuance of the permit or include the
conditions in the permit, as the case may be. Failure to report within the 45 day period shall
be deemed to constitute a report in favor of issuance of the permit and without the
recommendations of conditions to the permit.
§ 1108 Effect of Project Approval, Denial, Appeal.
A. Approval. Action by the Planning Board or Zoning Board of Adjustment for approval of a
development application or issuance by the construction official of a building permit shall be
deemed to be final approval pursuant to this Ordinance. Such approval shall neither cause
nor prevent the filing of any collateral application or other proceeding required by any other
municipal ordinance to be made prior to undertaking the action requested concerning the
landmark or improvement in a historic district.
B. Denial. Denial of approval for a development application or of a building permit shall be
deemed to bar the applicant from undertaking the activity which would affect the landmark
or improvement in a historic district which was the subject of the denied application.
C. Postponement of Demolition. The Planning Board, upon affirmative vote of two-thirds of its
full membership, may postpone demolition of a landmark for up to one year. No municipal
official shall issue a demolition permit for a landmark without approval from the Planning
Board. If the Planning Board determines to postpone demolitions, it shall promptly initiate
such actions as may lead to the preservation of the premises within the one year hiatus.

stimulating interest and study in architecture and design, educating citizens in American
culture and heritage, or making the municipality a more attractive and desirable place in
which to live.
H. Buildings that are approved for demolition shall be recorded by photographic and
videographic means prior to demolition or the removal of any artifacts from the building or
site. The interior of each space, the exterior of the building and the grounds shall be
documented. A report on the building and grounds explaining the visual documentation and
its significance shall be submitted by a qualified architectural historian as part of the
permanent historical record of the Township at the expense of the applicant.

§ 1112 Standards for Rehabilitation and Adaptive Reuse.
A. A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires

B. The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic
materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.

their own right shall be retained and preserved.
E. Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that
characterize a property shall be preserved.
F. Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of
deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the
old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials.
Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial
evidence.
G. Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic
materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be
undertaken with the gentlest means possible.
H. Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved.
Land Use Ordinance
Lawrence Township, Mercer County §1100 - 1116
435
If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.
I. New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic
materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old
and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the
historic integrity of the property and its environment.
J. New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner
that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its
environment would be unimpaired.
K. Some exterior and interior alterations to historic buildings are generally need to assure its
continued use, but it is most important that such alterations do not radically change, obscure,
or destroy character defining spaces, materials, features or finishes.
L. The construction of an exterior addition to an historic building for a new use should be
avoided and shall be considered only after it is determined that the space needs of the new
use cannot be met through altering secondary, non-character defining, interior spaces.
M. Where an application for extensive rehabilitation or adaptive reuse is proposed, the applicant

to the height of windows in a building shall be visually compatible with the
buildings and places to which it is visually related.
4. Rhythm of solids to voids on facades fronting on public places. The relationship of
solids to voids in such facades of a building shall be visually compatible with the
buildings and places to which it is visually related.
5. Rhythm of Spacing of Buildings on Streets. The relationship of the building to the
open space between it and adjoining buildings shall be visually compatible with the
buildings and places to which it is visually related.
6. Relationship of materials, textures, and color. The relationship of materials, texture
and color of the facade and roof of a building shall be visually compatible with the
predominant materials used in the building to which it is visually related.

character of the building, and if within a district, to the whole area. The building site may be
significant in its own right or derive its significance from an historic building. The following
shall be considered in reviewing alterations to the historic building site:
1. Site elements. The site's related elements such as lighting, fences, signs, sidewalks
and furnishing; decorative elements such as statuary or monuments, shall be
compatible with the features of those structures which is visually related to and shall
