Preface 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the Town of Fuquay-
Varina, North Carolina. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1977 Code and ordinances subsequently 
adopted by the Board of Commissioners. The source of each section is included in the history note 
appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new 
and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables 
appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1977 Code and any 
subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The various sections within each chapter have been provided catchlines to facilitate usage. Notes which 
tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table 
listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this 
Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in the 1977 Code 
of Ordinances. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the 
dash refers to the Part number, and the first figure after the dash refers to the chapter within the part. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are 
an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under 
several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still 
others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the 
publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation 
will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be 
distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As 
revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments 
inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such 
amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all 
deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Daniel F. Walker, Code Attorney, and Howard 
George, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the 
other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the 
project. 
The publisher is most grateful to the town staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of 
the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a 
Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the town readily accessible to all citizens and which 
will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the town's affairs.

Chapter 4 - Public Works 


§ 4-1. - Condemnation of land; appeals. 
When any land or right-of-way shall be required for the purpose of opening new streets within the 
corporate limits of the Town, or for extending or adding to any street already open, or for widening the 
same, or for the purpose of providing a Town cemetery, or extending same, or for any other public use 
allowed by this charter or under the general law, and the parties owning same, either for want of the 
capacity in the parties to agree, on account of nonage, or any other reason, fail to agree as to the 
compensation for the same, and the same cannot be purchased from the owner or owners by agreement, 
the Town of Fuquay-Varina is hereby given the right, if it shall so desire, to condemn the land for such 
purpose or purposes by suit in Wake County Superior Court, in which suit, in the complaint, the purposes 
for which the land is desired to be condemned shall be set forth, and may proceed to condemn the same 
and have the compensation therefor to be paid to the owner or owners assessed by a jury; and when the 
Town shall have paid such compensation into court or to the owners, title thereto shall be full and 
complete for the purposes for which the same is subject to be condemned, and the suit shall be 
conducted as any other suit in said court: but if the summons is duly served on all the parties interested 
either by publication as provided by law or by personal service, and the service completed and the 
complaint filed ten days before the beginning of the term, then and in that event the action shall be 
returnable and triable at the return term named in the summons therein. Either party may appeal from the 
judgment as in any other case. In addition to the right to condemn by suit, as above given, the Town shall 
have the right, at its election, to condemn any land that it may desire for any of the purposes mentioned in 
this charter, by passing an ordinance duly condemning the same and laying the same out; and if the 
parties owning the land or any of them and the Town commissioners cannot agree upon a compensation 
therefor, then they may select three freeholders, resident in the Town, one to be selected by the board of 
commissioners, one to be chosen by the property owners, and the two so chosen shall choose the third 
person, and said three persons when so chosen shall proceed to assess the compensation therefor to be 
paid by the Town and the condemnation thereof, and they shall report their award to the board of 
commissioners and to the owner or owners of the property; and if any party shall be dissatisfied with such 
award, then in that case either party may appeal to the Superior Court of Wake County, but such appeal 
shall not hinder or delay the board of commissioners in putting the land to the use desired, and that such 
appeal when so docketed shall stand for trial on the first day of the next term of civil court. The methods 
of condemnation herein provided for shall not conflict with each other, and the board of commissioners of 
the Town is given full right to pursue any method it may desire, and the institution of suit for 
condemnation hereunder for any purpose allowed by this charter shall be an election to pursue such 
method. Whenever the method of condemnation by assessing the damages therefor by arbitration shall 
be pursued, when the award shall be reported to the board of commissioners, and the compensation 
allowed in the award or on appeal from the award by the owner or owners of the property condemned, the 
title to the land shall pass to and be vested in the Town of Fuquay-Varina, for the purposes for which it is 
condemned, as fully as if a judgment had been obtained therefor by suit in the Superior Court in the first 
instance, and such appeal shall decide only the amount of damages which the property owner or owners 
may be entitled to recover.

§ 4-4. - Street & sidewalk improvements. 
(a) ?Street improvements; assessment of cost. In addition to any authority which is now or may hereafter 
be granted by general law to the Town for making street improvements, the Town council [board] is 
hereby authorized to make street improvements and to assess the cost thereof against abutting 
property owners in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(b) ?When petition unnecessary. The Town council [board] may order street improvements and assess 
the cost thereof exclusive of the cost incurred at street intersections, against the abutting property 
owners at an equal rate per front foot, without the necessity of a petition, upon the finding by the 
council [board] as a fact: 
(1) ?That such street or part thereof is unsafe for vehicular traffic and it is in the public interest to 
make such improvement; or 
(2) ?That it is in the public interest to connect two streets, or portions of a street already improved; 
or 
(3) ?That it is in the public interest to widen a street, or part thereof, which is already improved; 
provided that assessments for widening any street or portions of street without petition shall be 
limited to the cost of widening and otherwise improving such street in accordance with the street 
classification and improvement standards established by the Town's thoroughfare or major 
street plan for the particular street or part thereof to be widened and improved under the 
authority granted by this article. 
(c) ?Street improvement defined. For the purpose of this article, the term "street improvement" shall 
include grading, regrading, surfacing, resurfacing, widening, paving, repaving, the acquisition of 
right-of-way and the construction or reconstruction of curb, gutters and street drainage facilities. 
(d) ?Sidewalks; assessment of cost. In addition to any authority which is now or may hereafter be 
granted by the General Statutes to the Town for making sidewalk improvements, the Town council 
[board] is hereby authorized to order to be made or to make sidewalk improvements or repairs 
without petition according to standards and specifications of the Town, and to assess the total cost 
thereof against abutting property owners. If a sidewalk is constructed on only one side of a street in a 
residential zone, the cost thereof may be assessed against a property abutting on both sides of the 
street, unless there already exists a sidewalk, on the other side of the street, the total cost of which 
has been assessed against the abutting property. 
(e) ?Assessment procedure. In ordering street and sidewalk improvements without a petition and 
assessing the cost thereof under authority of this article, the Town council [board] shall comply with 
the procedure provided in the General Statutes, except those provisions relating to the petition of 
property owners and the sufficiency thereof. 
(f) ?Effect of assessment. The effect of the act of levying assessments under the authority of this article 
shall for all purposes be the same as if assessed where levied under authority of the General 
Statutes of North Carolina.

§ 4-5. - Condemnation of nuisances; abatement. 
The Town of Fuquay-Varina shall have the power to condemn as nuisances all buildings, cisterns, wells, 
privies and other erections in the Town which on inspection shall be found to be unhealthy, unsanitary, or 
dangerous to person or property, and cause the same to be abated or removed at the expense of the 
owner, unless the owner thereof, at his or her own expense, upon notice and with the sanction and 
authority of the board of commissioners, shall reconstruct same in such manner as shall be prescribed by 
the laws of said Town; and as to all buildings, cisterns, wells, privies and other private improvements to

and to prohibit burial within the Town limits if deemed advisable or if found necessary to protect public 
health, and to condemn and close burial grounds and cemeteries in the more thickly settled portions of 
the Town, and, when demanded by the public interest or public health, or for the purpose of widening the 
streets of said Town or the laying of sidewalks therein, to remove or cause to be removed bodies interred 
in such condemned and closed cemeteries and burial grounds, and shall cause them to be reinterred in a 
suitable place to be provided by the Town at its expense, and whenever advisable the Town may 
condemn the land purposed to be used for the reinterring of bodies in the same manner as in 
condemnation of streets (section sixteen), and use such condemned ground formerly used for cemeteries 
for such other purposes as may best subserve the interest of the Town, or may sell same at a price to be 
fixed by the board of commissioners and may use the money so received in such manner as they may 
think best for the good of the Town. Any citizen of the Town of Fuquay-Varina may petition the board of 
commissioners of the Town to remove or cause to be removed bodies interred in such condemned and 
closed cemeteries and burial grounds as aforesaid, and the said board of commissioners may in its 
discretion require the party petitioning for the removal of such bodies as aforesaid to pay all the expenses 
of removing same and of providing a suitable place for the reinterment of said bodies. The Town of 
Fuquay-Varina shall have the power to acquire the land and ground inside or outside the Town limits by 
purchase, gift, or otherwise, to be devoted to and used for the purpose of public and private cemeteries, 
and to pass such suitable regulations concerning the burial of the dead therein as may be deemed proper 
by the board of commissioners; and the said Town shall also have the power to appropriate private 
property lying within or without the Town limits to be used and devoted to cemetery purposes as herein 
set forth, by condemnation proceedings brought for such purpose, and in such case the proceedings had 
to condemn such land shall be governed and controlled by the board of commissioners as provided for in

The right of control, easement, use, ownership of and title to the streets, highways, public thoroughfares 
and property of the Town of Fuquay-Varina, and all other public places and property, are hereby declared 
to be inalienable except by ordinance duly passed by a majority of all the members of the board of 
commissioners, and no grant or franchise or lease or right to use the same, either on, along, through, or 
across, under, or over the same, by any private corporation, association, or any individual, shall be 
granted by the board of commissioners, unless submitted to a vote of legally qualified voters of said 
Town, for a longer period than thirty years; provided, however, that whenever application is made for any 
grant or franchise, lease, right, or privilege in or to the streets or public thoroughfares of the Town of

public thoroughfares and highways of the Town of Fuquay-Varina to an election, at which the people of 
Fuquay-Varina shall vote upon the proposition therein submitted, the expense of which election shall be

in the ordinance granting any franchise, contract with the corporation on the terms and conditions upon 
which such franchise is granted. 
(Pr.1915, C. 167, § 25) 


§ 4-9. - Powers as to waterworks & electric light & power plants.

§ 4-10. - Condemnation powers. 
(a) ?Any Town has the power of eminent domain and may acquire by purchase, gift, or condemnation, 
any land, right of access, right-of-way, water right, privilege, easement, and any other interest in or 
relating to land, water, or improvements, either within or without the Town limits, for any lawful public 
use or purpose. In the exercise of the power of eminent domain, the Town is vested with all power 
and authority now or hereafter granted by the laws of North Carolina applicable to the Town and the 
Town may follow the procedures now or hereafter prescribed by those laws. 
(b) ?As an alternative to the procedures specified in Section I (subsection a) of this act, the Town may 
exercise the power of eminent domain for any of the purposes enumerated in Section I (subsection 
a), subject to the following procedures and conditions: 
(1) ?Institution of suit. The Town may institute a civil action to condemn the land or interest in land 
by filing in the Superior Court of Wake County a complaint and a declaration of taking and by 
depositing with the clerk of the court the sum specified in subsection (2) of this section. Upon 
filing of the complaint and declaration of taking and the deposit of the required sum, summons 
shall be issued and served in the manner provided for service for process in civil actions, with a 
copy of the complaint and declaration of taking and notice of the amount of the deposit, upon 
the person or persons named in the complaint. 
(2) ?Content of complaint and declaration of taking. The complaint and declaration of taking shall 
each include: 
a. ?A statement of the authority under which, and the public use for which, the property is 
taken; 
b. ?A description sufficient to identify the entire tract or tracts affected by the taking; 
c. ?A statement of the estate or interest in land taken for the public use, and a description 
sufficient to identify the area taken; and 
d. ?The names and addresses of those persons who the Town is informed and believes may 
have or claim to have an interest in the lands, so far as this information can by reasonable 
diligence be obtained. If any of these persons are infants, non compos mentis, or under 
any other disability, or if their names or whereabouts are unknown, the complaint and 
declaration of taking shall so state. The complaint shall also list any liens or other 
encumbrances which the Town, in the exercise of reasonable diligence, is informed and 
believes exist against the land; and the complaint shall include a prayer that there be a 
determination of just compensation in accordance with this section. The declaration of 
taking shall also state the amount of money which the Town estimates to be just 
compensation for the taking. The Town may amend the complaint and declaration of 
taking, and may increase the amount of the deposit at any time while the proceedings are 
pending, and the owner shall have the same rights of withdrawal of any additional amount 
as he had in the original deposit. 
(3) ?Answer; reply. Not later than 30 days after service of summons, complaint and declaration of 
taking, any person named in the complaint may file an answer. The answer shall contain 
admissions or denials of the allegations of the complaint as are appropriate, the names and 
addresses of the persons filing the answer, together with a statement as to their respective 
interests in the property taken, and any affirmative defenses or matters that are pertinent to the 
action. The answer may (i) pray only for a determination of just compensation, in which case 
title to the property shall vest in the Town when all persons named in the complaint have 
answered, or the 30 days' time for answering has expired, or (ii) deny the right of the Town to 
take the property for the use of purpose stated in the complaint, and pray for a determination of 
just compensation if the issue of right to take is resolved in favor of the Town, in which case title 
to the property shall vest in the Town only upon judgment entered in the Superior Court 
upholding the Town's right to take. 
Affirmative allegations in the answer shall be deemed denied by the Town, but the Town may 
file a reply within 30 days from receipt of a copy of the answer. 
(4) ?After the filing of the answer and reply, if any, the judge upon motion and 10 days' notice by 
any party shall, either in or out of term, hear and determine all issues raised by the pleadings, 
other than the issue of just compensation. Only the issue of just compensation shall be 
determined by a jury if either party request a jury in accordance with the rules of civil procedure. 
(5) ?Upon vesting of title to the property in the Town, the Town shall have right of immediate 
possession, and the court shall proceed to determine the issue of just compensation and to 
disburse the sum deposited by the Town, following as nearly as practicable the procedures set 
out in Article 9 of G.S. Chapter 136, adapted by substituting the Town in place of the 
Department of Transportation. 
(c) ?The provisions of this act (section) shall not apply with regard to properties owned by public service 
corporations as defined in G.S. 160A-243(c) unless the exercise of such power of eminent domain is 
either consented to by the owner of the property to be acquired by the Town, or otherwise, first 
adjudicated after notice and a hearing that such acquisition will not prevent or unreasonably impair 
the continued devotion to the public use of such properties, and the operation by such public service 
corporation. 
(d) ?This act (section) applies only to the Towns of Fuquay-Varina, and Knightdale.

(Code 1977, § 1-1001) 


§ 1-1002. - Provisions considered as continuations of existing ordinances. 
The provisions appearing in this Code, so far as they are the same as ordinances adopted prior to this 
Code and included herein, shall be considered as continuations thereof and not as new enactments. 
(Code 1977, § 1-1002) 


§ 1-1003. - Section designations. 
The headings of the several sections of this Code are intended as mere catchwords to indicate the 
contents of the section and shall not be deemed or taken to be titles of such sections nor as part of any 
section, nor, unless expressly so provided, shall they be so deemed when any of such sections, including 
the catchlines, are amended or reenacted. 
(Code 1977, § 1-1003) 


§ 1-1004. - Effect of repeal or expiration of ordinances. 
(a) ?The repeal of an ordinance, or its expiration by virtue of any provision contained therein, shall not

proceeding commenced before the repeal took effect or the ordinance expired. 
(b) ?When an ordinance which repealed another shall itself be repealed, the previous ordinance shall not 
be revived without express words to that effect. 
(Code 1977, § 1-1004) 


§ 1-1005. - Criminal penalty; not exclusive remedy; continuing violations.

misdemeanor punishable upon conviction by a fine not exceeding $50.00 or by imprisonment not 
exceeding 30 days, as provided in G.S. 14-4. A provision of this Code may provide by express 
statement that the maximum fine or term of imprisonment to be imposed for its violation shall be 
some figure or number of days less than the maximum penalties prescribed by G.S. 14-4. 
(b) ?In addition, and unless otherwise provided by this Code, any provision of this Code that makes 
unlawful a condition existing upon or use made of real property may be enforced by injunction and 
order of abatement, and the General Court of Justice shall have jurisdiction to issue such orders. 
When a violation of such an ordinance occurs, the Town may apply to the appropriate division of the 
General Court of Justice for a mandatory or prohibitory injunction and order of abatement 
commanding the defendant to correct the unlawful condition upon or cease the unlawful use of the 
property. The action shall be governed in all respects by the laws and rules governing civil 
proceedings, including the Rules of Civil Procedure in general and Rule 65 in particular. 
(c) ?In addition to an injunction, the court may enter an order of abatement as a part of the judgment in 
the cause. An order of abatement may direct that buildings or other structures on the property be 
closed, demolished, or removed; that fixtures, furniture, or other movable property be removed from 
buildings on the property; that grass and weeds be cut; that improvements or repairs be made; or 
that any other action be taken that is necessary to bring the property into compliance with the 
ordinance. If the defendant fails or refuses to comply with an injunction or with an order of abatement 
within the time allowed by the court, he may be cited for contempt, and the Town may execute the 
order of abatement. The Town shall have a lien on the property for the cost of executing an order of 
abatement in the nature of a mechanic's and materialman's lien. The defendant may secure 
cancellation of an order of abatement by paying all costs of the proceedings and posting a bond for 
compliance with the order. The bond shall be given with sureties approved by the Clerk of Superior 
Court in an amount approved by the judge before whom the matter is heard and shall be conditioned 
on the defendant's full compliance with the terms of the order of abatement within a time fixed by the 
judge. Cancellation of an order of abatement shall not suspend or cancel an injunction issued in 
conjunction therewith. 
(d) ?Except as otherwise provided in this Code or in any ordinance of the Town, each day any violation 
of such code or ordinance shall continue shall constitute a separate and distinct offense. 
(Code 1977, § 1-1005) 


§ 1-1006. - Severability of parts of Code. 
It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Board that the sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses 
and phrases of this Code are severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph, or section of this 
Code shall be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by the valid judgment or decree of any court 
of competent jurisdiction, such unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any of the remaining 
phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this Code since the same would have been 
enacted by the Board without the incorporation in this Code of any such unconstitutional or invalid phrase, 
clause, sentence, paragraph or section. 
(Code 1977, § 1-1006) 


§ 1-1007. - Damaging ordinances prohibited. 
No person shall tear or deface any of the Town ordinances.

§ 1-1008. - Amendments to Code.

specific reference to the section number of this Code. Such amendments may be in the following 
language: "That section _____ of the Code of Ordinances, Town of Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina 
(or Fuquay-Varina Municipal Code), is hereby amended to read as follows:." The new provisions 
may then be set out in full as desired. 
(b) ?If a chapter, article or section not heretofore existing in this Code is to be added, the following 
language may be used: "That the Code of Ordinances, Town of Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina (or 
Fuquay-Varina Municipal Code), is hereby amended by adding a (chapter, article or section) to be 
numbered _____, which (chapter, article or section) reads as follows::." The new chapter, article or 
section may then be set out in full as desired. 
(c) ?All sections, articles, chapters or provisions of this Code desired to be repealed shall be specifically 
repealed by section, article or chapter number, as the case may be. 
(d) ?In addition to such indications as may be contained in the text of a proposed ordinance, the 
amendment, addition or repealer shall be shown in concise form above the ordinance. 


§ 1-1009. - Supplementation of Code. 
(a) ?By contract or by Town personnel, supplements to this Code shall be published, prepared and 
printed in accordance with the North Carolina General Statutes. A supplement to the Code shall 
include all substantive permanent and general parts of ordinances passed by the town board during 
the period covered by the supplement and all changes made thereby in the Code. The pages of a 
supplement shall be so numbered that they will fit properly into the Code and will, where necessary, 
replace pages which have become obsolete or partially obsolete, and the new pages shall be so 
prepared that, when they have been inserted, the Code will be current through the date of the 
adoption of the latest ordinance included in the supplement. 
(b) ?In preparing a supplement to this Code, all portions of this Code which have been repealed shall be 
excluded from reprinted pages. 
(c) ?When preparing a supplement to this Code, the codifier (meaning the person, agency or 
organization authorized to prepare the supplement) may make formal, non-substantive changes in 
ordinances and parts of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so to 
embody them into a unified Code. For example, the codifier may: 
(1) ?Organize the ordinance material into appropriate subdivisions; 
(2) ?Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for sections and other subdivisions of the 
Code printed in the supplement, and make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles; 
(3) ?Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, 
where necessary to accommodate new material, change existing section or other subdivision 
numbers; 
(4) ?Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same meaning to "this chapter," "this 
article," "this division," etc., as the case may be, or to "sections _____ to _____" (inserting 
section numbers to indicate the sections of the Code which embody the substantive sections of 
the ordinance incorporated into the Code); 
(5) ?Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve the original meaning of ordinance 
sections inserted into the Code; but in no case shall the codifier make any change in the 
meaning or effect of ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the 
Code. 
State Law reference Authority of town to provide for looseleaf supplementation of Code, 
G.S. 160A-77. 


§ 1-1010. - Certain ordinances not affected by Code.

implicitly repeal or otherwise affect the validity of any of the following ordinances in effect at the time 
of Code adoption: 
(1) ?Any ordinance promising or guaranteeing the payment of money for the Town, or authorizing 
the issuance of any bonds of the Town or any evidence of the Town's indebtedness; 
(2) ?Any ordinance providing for public improvements and assessments therefor; 
(3) ?Any zoning ordinance or any ordinance regulating or otherwise relating to the subdivision of

placing trash or waste at the curb or edge of the street on their designated day will not receive any 
collection until the following week on the normal collection day.

§ 5-1036. - Water conservation Stage III, water shortage crisis. 
Whenever the Town Board has declared a water shortage crisis and finds a need to provide for the 
equitable distribution of critically-limited treated water or water supplies to ensure that sufficient treated 
water is available to preserve public health and safety of the citizens, the Town may enforce a water 
rationing policy. Such rationing policy shall be approved by the Town Board at the time of the declaration 
of the water shortage crisis and should be reflective of the following criteria: 
(1) ?It is imperative that water customers achieve an immediate further reduction in water use in 
order to extend existing water supplies and, at the same time, assure that sufficient water is 
available to preserve the public health and sanitation and to provide fire protection service. This 
immediate further reduction in water usage is another step along a continuum of responses to 
any water shortage crisis. Should the crisis continue, further reductions in water usage may be 
required. It must be emphasized that additional usage reductions in the rationed area is a valid 
and attainable goal reflective of the conditions of the crisis. The goal of Stage III conservation 
measures is to reduce overall consumption by a total of 30 percent. 
(2) ?The policy must provide for equitable reductions in water usage and for equal sacrifice on the 
part of each water customer. The success of this policy depends on the cooperation of all water 
customers in the emergency area. 
(3) ?The policy must ensure that fire protection is maintained. 
(4) ?The policy shall make it unlawful to fail to act in accordance with the restrictions on potable 
water use or to attempt to evade or avoid such water rationing restrictions. 
(5) ?The policy may include additional measures of mandatory conservation controls such as a 
percentage reduction in consumption, termination of service to specific areas in the water 
system on a rotating basis, prohibition of all industrial uses of potable water, and the like, or 
whatever is necessary to protect the health and safety of the customers of the water system. 
(6) ?In the event of a Stage III water shortage crisis, the following mandatory water conservation 
measures shall apply. It will be unlawful to use water from the public water system supplied by 
the Town for the following purposes: 
a. ?To water or sprinkle any lawn, grass, shrubbery, trees or flowers with potable water 
supplied by the Town. 
b. ?To wash automobiles, trucks, boats, airplanes or any other type of mobile equipment, even 
at commercial facilities that recycle water. 
c. ?All 45-day grass or sod permits are suspended. 
(Code 1977, § 5-1036; Ord. No. M-08-01, 1-22-2008) 


§ 5-1037. - Regulations. 
(a) ?During the effective period of any Stage I water shortage, Stage II warning, emergency, or Stage III 
crisis, the Town is empowered to promulgate such regulations or policies as may be necessary to 
carry out the provisions of this article. The Town Manager, or his duly authorized agent charged with 
implementation and enforcement of this article, shall be and is hereby granted the authority to

of the first violation) or is continuing to violate this article or any prohibition, limitation, or requirement 
contained in this article following a warning (given within one year of the first violation), the Town 
Manager or his duly authorized agent is authorized to issue a citation to the violator. The citation will 
carry with it a $50.00 fine for such violation. A subsequent or continuation of a violation that results in 
the issuance of another citation will carry with it a $100.00 fine.

single reading over ten percent of the lower explosive limit (LEL) of the meter. 
(c) ?Pollutants, substances, wastewater or other wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed 
or stored in such a manner that they could he discharged to the municipal wastewater system. All 
floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's 
pretreatment facility before connecting with the system. 
(d) ?When the POTW Director determines that a user is contributing to the POTW any of the above 
enumerated substances in such amounts which may cause or contribute to interference of POTW

concentration of a pollutant in wastewater, the POTW Director may impose equivalent 
concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c). 
(2) ?When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not 
regulated by the same standard, the POTW Director shall impose an alternate limit using the 
combined waste stream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 
(3) ?A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, 
pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to 
its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when developing 
the categorical pretreatment standard. 
(4) ?A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 
403.15.

§ 5-2043. - Reports of potential problems. 
(a) ?In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a 
non-routine, episodic nature, a non-customary batch discharge or a slug load as defined in section 5-
2022, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and 
notify the POTW Director of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, 
type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
(b) ?Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the POTW Director, 
submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken 
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any 
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, 
natural resources or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the 
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this part. 
(c) ?A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising 
employees who to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this section. 
Employers shall ensure that all employees who may cause such a discharge to occur are advised of 
the emergency notification procedure. 
(d) ?All SIUs are required to notify the POTW immediately of any changes at its facility affecting the

§ 5-2045. - Notice of violation/repeat sampling & reporting. 
(a) ?If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the POTW Director within 
24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis 
and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the POTW Director within 30 days after becoming 
aware of the violation. If allowed by the POTW Director, the user is not required to resample: 
(1) ?If the POTW Director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month; or 
(2) ?If the POTW Director samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives 
the results of this sampling. 
(b) ?If the POTW Director does not require the user to perform any self-monitoring and the POTW 
sampling of the user indicates a violation, the POTW Director shall repeat the sampling and obtain 
the results of the repeat analysis within 30 days after becoming aware of the violations, unless one of 
the following occurs: 
(1) ?The POTW Director monitors at the user's facility at least once a month; 
(2) ?The POTW Director samples the user between their initial sampling and when the POTW 
receives the results of this initial sampling; or 
(3) ?The POTW Director requires the user to perform sampling and submit the results to the POTW 
Director within the 30 day deadline of the POTW becoming aware of the violation. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2045; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008) 


§ 5-2046. - Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
The Town prohibits the discharge of any hazardous wastes without notification to and approval by the 
POTW Director. 
(1) ?Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA 
Regional Waste Management Division Director and State hazardous waste authorities, in 
writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would 
be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notification must include the name of the 
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number and the type of 
discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such 
waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following 
information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an 
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass 
and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharge during the calendar month 
and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged 
during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days before 
the discharge commences. The user shall not begin the discharge until receiving written 
approval from the Town. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for 
each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed conditions must be 
submitted under section 5-2042. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to 
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the 
self-monitoring requirements of sections 5-2038, 5-2039 and 5-2041. 
(2) ?Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (1) of this section during a 
calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, 
unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specific in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). 
Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of 
any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), 
requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more 
than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
(3) ?In the case of any new regulation under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional 
characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, 
the user must notify the POTW Director, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division 
Director, and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within 90 
days of the effective date of such regulations. 
(4) ?In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a 
program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the 
degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(5) ?This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be 
discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable Federal or State law.

M-13-02, 3-4-2013) 


§ 5-2047. - Analytical requirements. 
All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge 
permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR 
136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR 136 does 
not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be 
performed in accordance with procedures approved by the EPA. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2047; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008) 


§ 5-2048. - Grab & composite sample collection. 
(a) ?All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and 
flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean and maintained in good working 
order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not 
be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
(b) ?Grab samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, volatile organic 
compounds and any other pollutants as required by 40 CFR 136. The POTW shall determine the 
number of grabs necessary to be representative of the user's discharge. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(5) 
for additional grab sample number requirements for BMR and 90-day compliance reports. 
Additionally, the POTW Director may allow collection of multiple grabs during a 24-hour period which 
are composited prior to analysis as allowed under 40 CFR 136. 
(c) ?Composite samples. All wastewater composite samples shall be collected with a minimum of hourly 
aliquots or grabs for each hour that there is a discharge. All wastewater composite samples shall be 
collected using flow proportional composite collection techniques, unless time-proportional 
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the POTW Director. When authorizing time-
proportional composites or grabs, the samples must be representative and the decision to allow the 
alternative sampling must be documented. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2048; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008) 


§ 5-2049. - Timing. 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not 
mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of 
receipt of the report shall govern. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2049; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008) 


§ 5-2050. - Record keeping. 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this part shall retain, and make available for inspection and 
copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this part and 
any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user 
independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method and time of 
sampling and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who 
performed the analyses: the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. 
These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be 
automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the Town, or where the 
user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the POTW Director. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2050; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008) 


§ 5-2051. - Electronic reporting.

Article F - Compliance Monitoring 


§ 5-2052. - Monitoring facilities. 
(a) ?The Town requires the user to provide and operate at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities 
to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage 
systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the Town 
may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the 
facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will not be 
obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
(b) ?There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility to allow accurate sampling 
and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling and measuring equipment shall be 
maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user. 
(c) ?Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be 
provided in accordance with the Town's requirements and all applicable local construction standards 
and specifications. Construction shall be completed within 90 days following written notification by 
the Town. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2052; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008) 


§ 5-2053. - Inspection & sampling. 
The Town will inspect the facilities of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this part is being met 
and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of premises where wastewater is 
created or discharged shall allow the Town, approval authority and EPA or their representative ready 
access at all reasonable times to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, 
records examination and copying or in the performance of any of their duties. The Town, approval 
authority and EPA shall have the right to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to 
conduct sampling, inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where a user has 
security measures in force which would require proper identification and clearance before entry into their 
premises, the user shall make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon 
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the Town, approval authority and EPA will be 
permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of performing their specific responsibilities. Denial of 
the Town's approval authority's or EPA's access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this part. 
Unreasonable delays may constitute denial of access. 
(Code 1977, § 5-2053; Ord. No. M-94-14, 11-7-1994; Ord. No. M-08-16, 11-3-2008; Ord. No. 
M-13-02, 3-4-2013) 


§ 5-2054. - Search warrants. 
If the Town, approval authority or EPA has been refused access to a building, structure or property, or 
any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of 
this part, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling 
program of the Town designed to verify compliance with this part or any permit or order issued hereunder, 
or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the community, then the Town, approval 
authority or EPA may seek issuance of a search warrant from the District Court of Wake County.

Article G - Confidential Information 


§ 5-2055. - Information & data on users. 
(a) ?Information and data on a user obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits 
and monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or other governmental 
agency without restriction unless the user specifically requests and is able to demonstrate to the 
satisfaction of the POTW Director that the release of such information would divulge information, 
processes or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user. Any such 
request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. 
(b) ?When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a report which might disclose 
trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall 
be made available upon written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this part, the 
National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, non-discharge permit and/or the 
pretreatment programs; provided, however, that such portions of a report shall be available for use 
by the State or any State agency in judicial review or enforcement proceedings involving the person 
furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics will not be recognized as 
confidential information. 
(c) ?All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards shall be made available to officials of 
the approval authority and EPA upon request.

§ 5-2056. - Reserved. 


Article H - Enforcement 


§ 5-2057. - Administrative remedies. 
(a) ?Notification of violation. Whenever the POTW Director finds that any industrial user has violated or 
is violating this part, wastewater permit, or any prohibition, limitation or requirements contained 
therein or any other pretreatment requirement the POTW Director may serve upon such a person a 
written notice stating the nature of the violation. Within 30 days from the date of this notice, an 
explanation for the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction thereof shall be submitted to 
the Town by the user. Submission of this plan does not relieve the discharger of liability for any 
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
(b) ?Consent orders. The POTW Director is hereby empowered to enter into consent orders, assurances 
of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with the person 
responsible for the noncompliance. Such orders will include specific action to be taken by the 
discharger to correct the noncompliance within a time period also specified by the order. Consent 
orders shall have the same force and effect as an administrative order issued pursuant to subsection 
(d) of this section. 
(c) ?Show cause hearing. 
(1) ?The POTW Director may order any industrial user who causes or is responsible for an 
unauthorized discharge, has violated this part or is in noncompliance with a wastewater 
discharge permit to show cause why a proposed enforcement action should not be taken. In the 
event the POTW Director determines that a show cause order should be issued, a notice shall 
be served on the user specifying the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement 
action, the reasons for such action and a request that the user show cause why this proposed 
enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the hearing shall be served personally or 
by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, at least ten days before the hearing. 
Service may be made on any agent or officer of a corporation. 
(2) ?The POTW Director shall review the evidence presented at the hearing and determine whether 
the proposed enforcement action is appropriate. 
(3) ?A show cause hearing under this section is not a prerequisite to the assessment of a civil 
penalty under section 5-2058, nor is any action or inaction taken by the POTW Director under 
this section subject to an administrative appeal. 
(d) ?Administrative orders. When the POTW Director finds that an industrial user has violated or 
continues to violate this part, permits or orders issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment 
requirement, the POTW Director may issue an order to cease and desist all such violations and 
direct those persons in noncompliance to do any of the following: 
(1) ?Immediately comply with all requirements; 
(2) ?Comply in accordance with compliance time schedule set forth in the order; 
(3) ?Take appropriate remedial or preventive action in the event of a continuing or threatened 
violation; 
(4) ?Disconnect unless adequate treatment facilities, devices or other related appurtenances are 
installed and properly operated within a specified time period. 
(e) ?Emergency suspensions. 
(1) ?The POTW Director may suspend the wastewater treatment service and/or wastewater permit 
when such suspension is necessary in order to stop an actual or threatened discharge which 
presents or may present an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of 
persons or the environment, interferes with the POTW or causes the POTW to violate any 
condition of its NPDES or non-discharge permit. 
(2) ?Any user notified of a suspension of the wastewater treatment service and/or the wastewater 
permit shall immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. A hearing will be held within 15 days 
of the notice of suspension to determine whether the suspension may be lifted or the user's 
waste discharge permit terminated. In the event of a failure to comply voluntarily with the 
suspension order, the POTW Director shall take such steps as deemed necessary including 
immediate severance of the sewer connection to prevent or minimize damage to the POTW 
system or endangerment to any individuals. The POTW Director shall reinstate the wastewater 
permit and the wastewater treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the noncompliant 
discharge. The industrial user shall submit a detailed written statement describing the causes of 
the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence to the POTW 
Director prior to the date of the hearing described in this section. 
(f) ?Termination of permit or permission to discharge. The POTW Director may revoke a wastewater 
discharge permit or permission to discharge for good cause, including, but not limited to, the 
following reasons: 
(1) ?Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents and characteristics of a discharge; 
(2) ?Failure to report significant changes in operations, or wastewater constituents and 
characteristics; 
(3) ?Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection or 
monitoring; or 
(4) ?Violation of conditions of the permit or permission to discharge, conditions of this chapter, or 
any applicable State and Federal regulations. Noncompliant industrial users will be notified of 
the proposed termination of their wastewater permit and will be offered an opportunity to show 
cause under this section why the proposed action should not be taken.

and according to the provisions of any applicable State of North Carolina and local law, 
and the terms of the permit(s). 
B. ?Inspection organizations. When deemed necessary by the appropriate inspector, 
inspections may be made by approved and recognized inspection organizations; provided, 
no approval shall be based upon reports of such organizations unless the same are in 
writing and certified by a responsible officer of such organization. 
C. ?Street or alley lines. Where the applicant for a permit proposes to erect any building or 
structure on the line of any street, alley or other public place, the owner shall secure a 
survey of the line of such street, alley or other public place, adjacent to the property upon 
which such building or structure is to be erected before proceeding with construction of 
such building or structure. It shall be the responsibility of the owner or authorized agent to 
see that the building does not encroach upon such street, alley or other public place. 
D. ?Call for inspection. All holders of permits, or authorized agent(s), shall notify the 
Inspections Department when work is ready for inspection and to provide access to and 
means for inspection of the work for any required inspections so that approval may be 
granted before work is continued. 
i. ?Footing inspection. Footing inspections shall be made after the trenches are 
excavated, all grade stakes are installed, all reinforcing steel and supports are in 
place and appropriately tied, all necessary forms are in place and braced, and prior to 
placement of any concrete.

materials and equipment to be concealed by the concrete slab are completed. 
iii. ?Foundation & crawl space inspection. Foundation and crawl space inspections shall 
be made after all foundation supports are installed. This inspection is to check 
foundation supports, crawl space leveling, ground clearances and positive drainage, 
when required. 
iv. ?Rough-in inspection. Rough-in inspections shall be made when all building framing 
and parts of the electrical, plumbing, fire protection or heating-ventilation and/or 
cooling system that will be hidden from view in the finished building have been placed, 
but before any wall or ceiling finish or building insulation is installed. 
v. ?Building framing inspection. Building framing inspections shall be made after the roof, 
excluding roof covering, wall ceiling and floor framing is complete, with appropriate 
blocking, bracing and fire-stopping in place. The following items shall be in place and 
visible for inspection:

Work may continue without approval of lintels supported on masonry or concrete. 
vi. ?Insulation inspection. Insulation inspections shall be made after approved rough-in 
and building framing inspections, and after the permanent roof covering is installed 
and all insulation and vapor retarders in place, but prior to any wall or ceiling covering

vii. ?Fire protection inspection. Fire protection inspections shall be made in all buildings 
where any material is used for fire protection purposes. The permit holder, or 
authorized agent(s), shall notify the Inspections Department after all fire protection

successive inspection without first obtaining the approval of the Code Enforcement Official. 
The Inspections Department, upon notification, shall make the requested inspection(s) and 
shall either indicate the portion of construction being inspected is satisfactory as completed 
or shall notify the permit holder or authorized agent(s) that the work fails to comply with the 
technical codes. Failure to request for inspections or proceeding construction without 
approval at each state of construction shall be deemed a violation of this article. 
F. ?Certificate of compliance. Upon satisfactory completion of building, plumbing, mechanical, 
electrical, fire protection and/or gas system inspections, or portions thereof, a certificate of 
compliance shall be issued. The certificate of compliance represents that the structure or 
system is complete and, for certain types of permits, is permission granted for connection 
to a utility system. The certificate of compliance shall not be construed to grant authority to 
occupy a building. 
G. ?Certificate of occupancy (CO). No new building or part thereof shall be occupied, and no 
addition or enlargement of any existing building after being altered or moved shall be 
occupied, and no change of occupancy shall be made in any existing building or part

compliance with this article, the appropriate regulatory codes and any zoning regulations 
for the occupancy intended. The Inspections Department shall issue a certificate of 
occupancy when, after examination and inspection, it is found that the building in all 
respects conforms to the provisions of this article, the regulatory codes, and any zoning 
regulations for the occupancy intended. 
H. ?Existing buildings. A certificate of occupancy for an existing building may be obtained by 
applying to the Inspections Department and supplying such information and data deemed 
necessary to determine compliance with the applicable technical codes for the occupancy 
intended. When necessary, the Inspections Department may require detailed drawings and 
inspections to determine compliance with the applicable codes. When, upon examination 
and inspection, it is found that the building conforms to the provisions of the technical 
codes, the Land Development Ordinance and other applicable laws for such occupancy, a 
certificate of occupancy shall be issued. The certificate shall state the approved occupancy 
type. 
I. ?Penalty for failure to obtain permits. Inspections will not be made prior to the owner, or 
authorized agent, obtaining all the proper permits. It is a violation of G.S. 160A-417 to 
proceed with construction prior to obtaining a permit by State and local law(s). An inspector 
for the Town of Fuquay-Varina may stop any work proceeding without a permit. The owner, 
or authorized agent(s), shall be required to obtain all the proper permits before proceeding 
with any further construction work. The owner, or authorized agent(s), will be charged, in 
addition to the required building permit fees, a penalty fee per applicable permit for the type 
of construction work for the site in violation. Such permit fee(s) shall be assessed as 
adopted in the fee schedule, per permit applicable for the type of construction work for the 
site in violation and will be charged for all permits required, regardless of whether or not 
that particular type of work has been started. All permits shall be obtained at one time. 
(6) ?Oversight not to legalize violation. No oversight or dereliction of duty on the part of any

constructed, reconstructed, altered or repaired in a hazardous manner; in violation of any 
provision of this article, any other Town ordinance or insubstantial violation of any provision 
of any regulatory code herein adopted; in violation of the terms of the permit(s) issued 
therefor; or in such manner as to endanger life or property, the appropriate inspector may 
order that the specific part of the hazardous or violation work be immediately stopped. The 
stop work order shall be in writing, directed to the person doing the work, and shall state 
the specific work to be stopped, the specific reason(s) therefor and the conditions under 
which the work may resume. 
(8) ?Enforcement of zoning regulations. 
A. ?Zoning regulations. If the Inspections Department is charged with enforcement of any 
zoning regulations, then no permit for alteration, repair or construction of any building or 
structure shall be issued unless the plans and specifications show that the building or 
structure, and its proposed use, will be in compliance with applicable provisions of the 
zoning regulations. 
B. ?Site plan submittal. When site plan submittal is required, then no permit for alteration, 
repair or construction of any building or structure shall be issued prior to site plan approval

contractor to which the permit was issued and direct them to correct the North Carolina 
State Building Code violation within 30 days. 
D. ?Department of Insurance review. If there is a disagreement between the contractor and the 
Building Inspector as to what constitutes a technical code violation, the Building Inspector 
shall request that the North Carolina Department of Insurance review the specific, technical 
code items and render a written opinion to the Building Inspector. 
E. ?Determination against contractor. If the North Carolina Department of Insurance 
determines that in fact these items are code violations, the contractor again will be directed 
to correct those identified items. If the contractor refuses to arrange to correct the items, 
within 30 days, the Building Inspector shall file with the appropriate North Carolina 
Licensing Board a complaint against the contractor requesting that appropriate disciplinary 
action be taken. 
F. ?Appeal to Board of Adjustment. In the event that action by the appropriate State Licensing 
Board does not cause the contractor to correct the identified technical code violation, or the 
individual responsible for construction is not a licensed general contractor, the Building 
Inspector shall notify the contractor by registered letter that no further permits will be 
issued to him or his agents until such corrections have been completed and inspected. 
Within ten days of receipt of the letter, the contractor may appeal the Building Inspector's 
decision to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Article Q Procedures &

ordinance or order; then if the Town Board of Commissioners finds that the owner has abandoned 
the intent and purpose to repair, alter or improve the building or structure, and that the continuation 
of the building or structure in its vacated and closed status would be inimical to the health, safety and 
general welfare of the Town in that it would continue to deteriorate, would create a fire or safety 
hazard, would be a threat to children and vagrants, would attract persons intent on criminal activities, 
or would cause or contribute to blight and the deterioration of property values in the area; then the 
Town Board of Commissioners may, after the expiration of the two-year period, adopt an ordinance 
and serve such ordinance on the owner, setting forth the following:

ordinance shall be recorded in the Office of the Wake County Register of Deeds and shall be 
indexed in the name of the property owner in the grantor index. 
j. ?Methods of service of complaints & orders.

is by regular mail in conjunction with registered or certified mail, and the registered or certified 
mail is unclaimed or refused, but the regular mail is not returned by the post office within ten 
days after mailing, service shall be deemed sufficient. The person mailing the complaint or order 
by regular mail shall certify that fact and the date thereof, and such certificate shall be 
conclusive in the absence of fraud. If regular mail is used, a notice of the pending proceedings 
shall be posed in a conspicuous place on the premises thereby affected.

the Inspections Director or Code Enforcement Officer, shall be secured in a manner directed by 
the court and shall be disbursed by the court to the persons found to be entitled thereto by final

the Inspections Director or Code Enforcement Officer to proceed to exercise his duties under 
G.S. 160A-493(f) to vacate and close or remove and demolish the nonresidential building or 
structure.

In order to ensure that development patterns, intensity and general use of land in the Town of Fuquay-
Varina corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) take place in an orderly and consistent 
manner; recognize and maintain the Town's character, historic and cultural heritage and natural and 
scenic resources; and offer services, retail, office and job opportunities, a healthy living environment and 
residential choices, it is necessary and proper to establish a series and varying types of zoning districts. 
Each zoning district establishes its own purpose and opportunities for development and use of land. All 
development within each zoning district shall be consistent with the purpose and intent of the Land 
Development Ordinance.

identified by the statement on the Map: "This is to certify that this is the Official Zoning Map of the Town of 
Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina, signed by the Mayor, attested by the Town Clerk and bearing the official 
seal of the Town of Fuquay-Varina." The certification date shall be affixed to the official zoning map. Such 
map shall be subject to subsequent changes, as adopted by the Town Board of Commissioners by 
reference. 


§ 9-1102. - Rules of interpretation. 
The following rules shall apply with respect to the boundaries of the various districts as shown on the 
official zoning map: 
a. ?Zoning district boundary lines. 
(1) ?Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, thoroughfares, highways, 
streets, roads, alleys, railroads, utility easements shall be construed as following the 
centerline of such features. Where the feature is officially vacated or abandoned, the 
boundary shall remain as originally located and shall not change by virtue of such vacation 
or abandonment until a zoning district map amendment provided in this Land Development 
Ordinance is granted. 
(2) ?Boundary lines shown as following, or approximately following, property lines, municipal 
boundaries, or other governmental body boundaries shall be construed to follow such lines. 
(3) ?Boundaries shown as following, or approximately following, the centerline of streams, 
rivers, other continuously flowing watercourses or levees shall be construed as following 
the channel centerline of such watercourses. In the event of a natural change in the 
location of such streams, rivers or other watercourses, the zoning district boundary shall be 
construed as moving with the channel centerline. 


§ 9-1103. - Amendments to the official zoning map. 
Amendments or changes made to the official zoning map boundaries or other matters portrayed on the 
official zoning map shall be made in accordance with the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance, 
specifically Article Q Procedures & Administration. Changes shall be entered on the official zoning map 
promptly after the amendment has been approved by the Town Board of Commissioners with an entry on 
the official zoning map. No amendment to the Land Development Ordinance which involves matters 
portrayed on the official zoning map shall become effective until after such change and entries are made 
on the official zoning map by the Planning Director or his/her designee. 


§ 9-1104. - Replacement of the official zoning map. 
The official zoning map may be replaced based on the following circumstances: 
a. ?Official map lost, damaged or illegible. In the event the official zoning map becomes damaged, 
destroyed, lost or difficult to interpret because of the nature and number of changes and 
additions, the Town Board of Commissioners shall adopt a new official zoning map by 
ordinance that shall supersede the prior official zoning map. 
b. ?New official zoning map. The new official zoning map may include corrections for drafting and 
clerical errors or omissions to the prior official zoning map, but no such corrections shall have 
the effect of amending the original official zoning map or subsequent amendments thereto 
without a public hearing, and pursuant to Article Q Procedures & Administration of the Land 
Development Ordinance. 


§ 9-1105. - Zoning map disputes. 
The Planning Director or his/her designee shall have the authority to interpret the official zoning map and 
determine where the boundaries of the different zoning districts fall, if in dispute. If the decision of the 
Planning Director or his/her designee is not agreeable by the person or entity requesting the interpretation

§ 9-1154. - Conditional zoning districts (CZD). 
Conditional zoning districts are zoning districts in which the development and use of the property is 
subject to predetermined standards, rules, regulations and conditions imposed as part of a legislative 
decision applied to a particular property. A conditional zoning district allows a particular use or uses to be 
established only in accordance with specific standards and conditions pertaining to the specific property. 
Certain planned uses are of a nature or scale that has significant impact on both the immediate area and 
the community as a whole, which cannot be predetermined and controlled by general district designations 
or standards. There may also be circumstances in which a general district designation allows such a use 
by right, but would not be appropriate for a particular property even though the use itself could, if properly 
planned, be appropriate using a conditional zoning district consistent with adopted plans, with regulations 
and conditions to meet the goals and objectives of the conditional zoning district regulations. The 
following traditional zoning districts may be petitioned for a conditional zoning district, meeting the 
regulations and standards of the Land Development Ordinance: 
a. ?Residential conditional zoning districts. 
(1) ?RCCZD Resource Conservation Conditional Zoning District. 
(2) ?RACZD Residential Agricultural Conditional Zoning District. 
(3) ?RLDCZD Residential Low Density Conditional Zoning District.

Between January 22, 1985, and April 6, 2009, the Town of Fuquay-Varina established 
conditional use districts with "conditional use (CU)" added as a prefix to the zoning district title 
to which zoning map amendments were adopted by the Town Board of Commissioners and as 
such identified only on the official zoning map, which were later repealed. Any provisions of the 
repealed "conditional use district," "uses permitted in conditional use districts" and "conditional 
use permit request" as last amended or approved shall be remain in effect for that particular 
zoning map amendment, but at the effective date of the Land Development Ordinance, shall be

Town's development pattern to address urban design, meet the demand for all types of housing, 
include public and private parks and greenways and incorporate necessary and desired 
commercial and educational facilities. This district may accommodate residential uses not to 
exceed six dwelling units per gross acre with public utilities. This type of development 
encourages the conservation and more efficient use of open space, protection of environmental 
sensitive areas, enhances recreation and activities for healthy living, promotes a pedestrian-
friendly environment and well-designed and coordinated streets and pedestrian patterns. The 
Town encourages this type of development that can be resilient to market trends and is an 
economic strength for the community. This district is intended to offer flexibility in regulations 
and performance standards to create a total development master plan integrating a mix of uses

The exception to this requirement is within the Downtown Center-1 (DC-1), Downtown Center-2 (DC-2), 
Residential Mixed-Use (RMU), Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) and Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) Zoning 
Districts where the requirements of the zoning district applies or in a mixed-use development where the 
requirements of the use shall apply. A development comprised of separate uses shall be reviewed using 
the most restrictive requirements and process from among the proposed uses. 


§ 9-1253. - Permitted uses. 
a. ?Purpose. Use classifications summarize the principal uses permitted in the specific zoning districts. 
All of the uses under the "use classification" in the permitted use table are defined in Article S 
Interpretation & Definitions, section 9-1902 Use Classification. 
b. ?Interpretation of permitted use table. 
(1) ?Uses permitted by right. A "P" indicates that a use is allowed as a matter of right in the 
perspective zoning district, subject to compliance with all applicable regulations in the Land 
Development Ordinance. 
(2) ?Special use permit. An "S" indicates that a use may be permitted in the respective district only 
when approved by the Board of Adjustment, Article Q Procedures & Administration. Special use 
permits are subject to all other applicable requirements of the Land Development Ordinance, 
including all applicable use standards, additional conditions, or specific modifications by the 
Board of Adjustment as part of a special use permit approval. 
(3) ?Uses with conditions. A "P*" indicates that a use may be subject to certain conditions, for 
example the use may have standards in one district but may have additional standards in a 
different district. 
(4) ?Uses not permitted. A blank cell indicates that a use type is not permitted in the respective 
zoning district, unless it is expressly allowed by other regulations of the Land Development 
Ordinance. 
c. ?Use standards & specific regulations. The final column of the permitted use table provides a cross-
reference to the use-specific standards applicable in one or more districts in which the use is 
permitted. The use standards found in Article F, section 9-1255 Use Standards is not applicable to 
the Residential Form-Based Zoning District (RMU), Neighborhood Form-Based Zoning District 
(NMU) and Urban Form-Based Zoning District (UMU), unless otherwise stated. To determine the 
regulations and use standards for these form-based districts, see Appendix B RMU, NMU & UMU 
Form-Based Zoning Districts.

*** ?Residential use is limited to a maximum percentage of the nonresidential property. See Multi-family 
under Article F Use Regulations. 
( Ord. No. PZ-16-13 , § 2, 12-5-2016; Ord. No. PZ-17-01 , § 3(Att. C), 4-3-2017) 


§ 9-1301. - General dimension & measurement standards. 
a. ?Density. Density shall be determined by taking the quotient of the total number of dwelling units on a 
site proposed for development divided by the gross acres of the site. 
b. ?Building height exception. A single-family residential dwelling may be permitted to have a building 
height greater than 40 feet where the dwelling is setback a minimum of 50 feet from the nearest 
public right-of-way, provided that one of the following two options are met: 
(1) ?Option one. A building of over 40 feet in height shall be required to have a minimum of two 
exits from the uppermost finished floor or unfinished area with a roof pitch greater than 6/12, in 
addition to the following standards: 
A. ?Exit compliance. The two exits shall meet the requirements of the North Carolina 
Residential Building Code for one- and two-family dwellings for exit stairs and shall be as 
remote as practical from each other. 
B. ?Window requirements & compliance. The uppermost floor levels, either finished floor or 
unfinished area, shall have a minimum of two exit windows meeting the requirements for 
an exit window, as specified in the North Carolina Residential Building Code for one- and 
two-family dwellings. 
C. ?Window locations. The windows shall be located remote from each other and shall be a 
minimum of one-half the diagonal distance of the floor area of the upper story. In addition, 
the windows shall be fully accessible by the Fire Department's ground ladders. 
D. ?Fire Marshal approval. Building plans that include a greater building height shall include 
stairs and window locations as herein described and shall be reviewed and approved by 
the Fire Marshal. 
(2) ?Option two. As an alternate to Option 1, above, the residential structure may be designed with 
the installation of an approved automatic sprinkler system according to the National Fire 
Protection Association Standards (NFPA) that completely protects all combustible construction. 
In addition, the complete sprinkler system shall be maintained as described and reference to the 
NFPA standards. 
c. ?Dimension/measurement. Required setbacks shall be measured as the dimension between the 
closer of either the nearest lot line or nearest street right-of-way line and the finished wall of a 
building or structure along a line at right angles to the lot line or street right-of-way line. Distances 
shall be measured on a straight line (from point "A" to point "B") without consideration to any 
intervening structures, roads or other landforms or uses, except as otherwise determined in the Land 
Development Ordinance. 
 
Figure  Required Setbacks
(1) ?No setback required. Where no minimum front, side or rear yard setbacks are specified, the 
setback line shall be conterminous with the corresponding lot line. Permitted encroachments or 
projections into yard setback areas shall not be utilized for measurement of a required setback. 
(2) ?Establishment of setbacks. Setbacks shall be established at the time of approval of a site plan 
or preliminary subdivision plan, and such setbacks established shall continue to apply to the 
area within the site plan or preliminary subdivision plan despite subsequent changes to the 
setback regulations. 
(3) ?Setbacks with required landscape buffer. Where a buffer is required pursuant to Article O 
Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards, the buffer location in association with the setback 
shall be in accordance with Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards and apply to all 
zoning districts, except for Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District, Downtown Center-2 (DC-
2) Zoning District, Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) Zoning District, Neighborhood Mixed-Use 
(NMU) Zoning District and Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) Zoning District. 
 
Figure  Typical Relationship between Easement & Yard Setbacks
(4) ?Landscape area adjacent to public right-of-way. A subdivision or development shall be required 
to maintain a landscape area adjacent to a public right-of-way pursuant to Article O 
Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards. 
d. ?General standards for setbacks. 
(1) ?Front setback. 
A. ?Standard setback. The front setback extends across the full width of a zoning lot or site, 
the depth of which is the minimum horizontal distance between the front property line and a 
line parallel thereto on the front plane of the principal building. 
B. ?Corner lot. The front setback on a corner lot shall be measured along the perimeter of the 
lot designated as the front, where the main entrance of the building is located. 
C. ?Provisional setback. Where an existing vacant lot is adjacent to developed lots on either 
side, the placement of the principal building may be allowed to use a front setback that falls 
at a point between the required front setback and the front setback that exist on the 
adjacent lot. This provision shall not be interpreted as requiring a greater front setback than 
imposed by the existing zoning district, and it shall not be interpreted as allowing setbacks 
to be reduced to a level that results in right-of-way widths being less than the established 
minimum requirement. 
(2) ?Rear setback. The rear setback extends across the full width of a zoning lot or site, the depth of 
which is the minimum horizontal distance between the rear property line and a line parallel 
thereto on the rear plane of the principal building, except that on a corner lot the rear setback 
shall extend only to the side setback abutting the right-of-way. 
(3) ?Side setback. The side setback extends from the rear line of the required front setback, or the 
front property line where no front setback is required, to the required rear setback, or the rear 
property line where no rear setback is required. The width is the horizontal distance between 
the side property line and a line parallel thereto on the side of the principal building, except that 
the corner side setback shall extend to the rear lot line. 
(4) ?Garage setback. A garage shall be located a minimum of 20 feet from a public right-of-way, 
whether attached to the principal structure or detached, where the access to the garage faces 
the public right-of-way. The side and rear setbacks for principal or accessory structures, as 
applicable, shall apply to a garage, based on the standard in accordance with the Land 
Development Ordinance. 
 
Figure  Garage Setback
(5) ?Internal building setbacks. 
A. ?Except for multi-family, townhouses, mixed-use developments and developments located 
within the DC-1 & DC-2 Form-Based Districts and the RMU, NMU & UMU Form-Based 
Districts, internal building setbacks for flex space buildings, and congregate living facilities 
shall comply with the following setback standards: 
i. ?Front to front. Minimum 50 feet. 
ii. ?Side to side. Minimum 20 feet. 
iii. ?Side to rear or rear to side. Minimum 30 feet. 
iv. ?Rear to rear. Minimum 40 feet. 
(6) ?Same lot. Except as provided elsewhere in the Land Development Ordinance, all yard setbacks 
allocated to a building or structure shall be located on the same lot as such building or structure. 
(7) ?Lot width measurement. 
A. ?Lot width. Lot width is the horizontal distance between side lot lines. Lot width shall be 
measured as the distance between the side lot lines at the public right-of-way or at the 
front building setback line based on the shape of the lot. 
B. ?Pie-shaped lot. A "pie-shaped" lot or a zoning lot where the width increases from front to 
rear, the lot width shall be measured along the front plane of the principal building. 
(8) ?Average lot size. Average lot size applies to the size of a single-family lot subdivision, including 
conventional subdivisions, open space developments and zero-lot line developments, where 
single-family residential uses are applied. The average lot size shall be calculated by taking the 
total gross acreage of the proposed lots and dividing by the total number of lots, and shall be 
calculated and provided on all required submittals. 
(9) ?Accessory buildings. An accessory building shall meet the yard requirements of the zoning 
district in which it is located, in accordance with Article G Lot & Structure Provisions, section 9-
1300, Table  Dimensions & Standards, unless otherwise provided. All accessory buildings or 
structures, when attached to a principal building shall comply with the yard requirements of the 
principal building in the zoning district in which it is located. Where an accessory building or 
structure [is] located within ten feet of the principal building and is attached to the principal 
building by means of a roofed breezeway or similar feature, [it] shall be considered attached to 
the principal building and shall meet the yard requirements of the principal building. 
(10) ?Landscape features. Trees, shrubs, flowers, fences, walls, hedges, landscaped lighting, 
ornamental statuary and other landscape features may be located within any required yard 
setback. 


§ 9-1302. - Permitted encroachment into required yard setbacks. 
Principal buildings or structures on a zoning lot shall not be located in whole or in part of a required 
zoning lot yard setback. In addition to landscape features, the following shall not be considered to be an 
obstruction, but a permitted exception, within the zoning lot yard setbacks. Additional standards which 
supersede the following exceptions may be applicable in accordance with Article F Use Regulations of 
the Land Development Ordinance.

the setback requirements of the district in which the feature is located in accordance with the Land 
Development Ordinance. 
f. ?Maximum Aggregate for permitted exceptions in zoning lot setbacks. Permitted exceptions in zoning 
lot setbacks shall not, in total aggregate, occupy more than 50 percent of the width of any single 
zoning lot required yard setback. 
( Ord. No PZ-18-02 , § 2(Atts. BD), 3-5-2018) 


§ 9-1303. - Fence & wall installations. 
Fences and walls are permitted exceptions into the zoning lot setback requirements of the Land 
Development Ordinance, except as otherwise prohibited in the Land Development Ordinance, under the 
following regulations: 
a. ?Fence material. A fence may be constructed of wood, masonry, stone, wrought-iron, black 
aluminum, synthetic material or chain link, unless otherwise provided by the Land Development 
Ordinance. Fencing shall be installed with the finished surface facing out to a public street or an 
adjacent property. The use of chain link fencing shall require the chain link to be covered with a 
plastic coating of either black or green. 
b. ?Fence placement. A fence shall be installed a minimum of three to six inches inside the property 
line and corner of the property on which the fence is being installed, except where property 
owners on either side of the property line consent to placement of the fence on and along the 
property line. In such case the adjoining property owner(s) shall provide a written affidavit 
agreeing to the location. A fence shall be installed a minimum of five feet from the property line 
in a corner side yard. 
(1) ?Placement in buffer & easement. Where a fence is proposed within a perimeter buffer that 
is part of a lot, regulated by Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards, such 
fence shall be placed a minimum of eight feet from the rear property line. The rear and side 
perimeter buffer plant materials shall be located on both sides of the fence, where 
applicable. In no case shall a fence be located within a dedicated easement for any 
purpose, except as otherwise permitted herein. 
(2) ?Clearance from finished grade. A minimum two-inch clearance from the bottom of a fence 
to the finished grade shall be provided, where applicable, to allow for unobstructed 
passage of water runoff. This requirement is not applicable to masonry, hedges, chain-link 
fence, split rail fence or the like. 
c. ?Residential zoning districts. 
(1) ?Front height. The maximum height of a fence in the zoning lot front yard shall not exceed 
four feet, paralleling the front property line or right-of-way line and along the side property 
lines to the front plane of the principal building. Opaque fences shall be prohibited in the 
front yard. 
(2) ?Side & rear height. The maximum height of a fence in the zoning lot side or rear yard is six 
feet, paralleling along the side or rear property line or right-of-way line from the front plane 
of the principal building to the rear property line. 
d. ?Nonresidential zoning districts. Fencing is permitted in accordance with the following standards 
within nonresidential zoning districts: 
(1) ?Commercial zoning districts. 
A. ?Front yard. All fencing located between a front lot line and the front of the principal 
building shall be ornamental fencing. Chain link fencing is prohibited within the front 
yard. 
B. ?Side & rear yards. Where used, chain link fencing in the side or rear yard shall be 
black or green vinyl coated chain link. 
(2) ?Industrial zoning districts. Fencing in industrial zoning districts shall comply with Article N 
Parking, Loading & Lighting Design Standards, section 9-1652 General Standards, e. 
Construction Alternatives, (2) All Other Use Parking, unless otherwise provided by the 
Land Development Ordinance. 
e. ?Prohibited fences. The use of electric fences (not including invisible fences for pets), concertina 
wire, standalone barb wire fences (not including barb wire at the top of chain link fencing where 
the fence is a minimum of eight feet in height in industrial districts) or other similar materials 
shall be prohibited within the corporate limits of the Town. 
f. ?Permit required. A fence permit from the Planning Department is required to install a fence, 
except that a bona fide farm, as defined in the North Carolina General Statutes, is exempt from 
this article. 
g. ?Walls. Retaining walls that are load bearing may require a building permit, as determined by the 
North Carolina State Building Code. Certain other walls may require a building permit, as 
determined by the North Carolina State Building Code. 
( Ord. No. PZ-16-13 , § 2, 12-5-2016) 


§ 9-1304. - Structures excluded from height limitations. 
The height limitations of the Land Development Ordinance shall not apply to a church steeple, belfry, 
cupola, dome, ornamental roof or tower not intended for human occupancy, monuments, elevated or 
ground storage water tanks, transmission or cell towers, chimneys, radio or television tower, parapet walls 
not exceeding a maximum height of 42 inches above a flat roof or above the roof line of a building with a 
gable, hip or shed roof, and screening material for mechanical and exhaust pipes on roofs, unless such 
structure is considered part of the height in regards to the North Carolina State Building Code regulations. 


§ 9-1305. - Substandard lots of record. 
Any zoning lot of record existing at the time of the adoption of the Land Development Ordinance, which 
has a square footage or a lot width which is less than the requirement of the Land Development 
Ordinance, shall be subject to the following exceptions and modifications: 
a. ?Adjoining lots. Where two or more adjoining lots with contiguous frontage are in single 
ownership at any time after the adoption of the Land Development Ordinance and said lots, 
individually, are less than the minimum square footage and/or have less than the minimum 
zoning lot width required in the district in which they are located, then such lots shall be 
considered as a single lot to achieve the minimum required lot square footage and minimum lot 
width for the district in which it is located. 
b. ?Zoning lot not meeting minimum lot size requirements. With the exception stated in subsection 
a. above, the following standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Single-family. In any district in which single-family detached dwellings are permitted, any 
zoning lot of record existing at the time of the effective date of the Land Development 
Ordinance, December 30, 2016, that has a lot square footage or lot width which is less 
than required by the Land Development Ordinance, but meets the required setbacks may 
be used as a zoning lot for a single-family detached dwelling only. 
(2) ?Nonresidential. In any nonresidential zoning district, on a zoning lot of record on the 
effective date, December 30, 2016, of the Land Development Ordinance a principal 
building may be established regardless of the size of the lot, provided all other 
requirements of the Land Development Ordinance are in compliance. 
c. ?Side yard requirements. With the exception as stated in subsection a. above, where a lot has a 
width less than the zoning lot frontage width required for the district in which the lot is located, 
the Town Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority to apply an administrative 
adjustment to reduce the zoning side yard setback requirements for such lot by a maximum of 
20 percent of the required setback, provided however, no zoning lot side yard setback shall be 
less than five feet in width. 


§ 9-1306. - Zoning lot size reduction prohibited. 
No existing zoning lot shall be reduced or changed in size so that the total area or square footage, 
minimum zoning lot yard setbacks, maximum dwelling units per acre, or any other minimum dimension, 
regulation or requirement are not maintained. 


§ 9-1307. - Zoning lot subdivision. 
No zoning lot shall be subdivided in size so as to create an additional lot that is not in conformity with the 
Land Development Ordinance, unless said lot is combined with other land to create a forming lot, or 
unless said lot is procured or donated for public use. 


§ 9-1308. - Illegal zoning lot of record. 
In no case shall a zoning lot created illegally be considered a lot of record. 


§ 9-1309. - Built-upon area & requirements.

requirements of the Land Development Ordinance. 
(1) ?Calculation. Calculation of the built-upon lot area or site shall include, but not be limited to, all 
existing public and private streets, proposed public streets, sidewalks, driveways, rooftops, 
parking lots, patios and all other impervious and partially impervious surfaces. Stone or gravel, 
for the purposes of the Land Development Ordinance, shall be defined as pervious area. 
(2) ?Exemptions. Swimming pools and wooden decks shall not be included in the calculation of the 
built-upon lot area or site. 
(3) ?Expressed as percentage. The calculation of built-upon lot area or site shall be expressed as a 
percentage of the total square footage or acreage of the lot or site. 
b. ?Measurements & dimensional standards for detached accessory structures. 
(1) ?Location of accessory structures. Detached accessory structures may be located in the side or 
rear yard area only on residential zoning lots less than one acre in size. If the detached 
accessory structure is located in the side yard it shall not extend beyond the front wall of the 
principal structure. Accessory structures permitted in nonresidential districts shall be in the rear 
yard regardless of zoning lot size. 
(2) ?Percentage of occupied yard area. No detached accessory building shall occupy more than 35 
percent of an area of the required yard setback, and shall be located no less than ten feet from 
any principal building. 
(3) ?Height of accessory structures. No detached accessory building or structure shall exceed the 
height of the principal building. 
(4) ?Corner lot. Where a detached accessory structure is located on a corner lot in a residential

§§ 9-1310 THROUGH 9-1349. - Reserved. 


Article H - Building Type & Architectural Standards 


§ 9-1350. - Purpose & intent. 
a. ?Town character. This article serves to establish a safe environment and coherent character for the 
Town that encourages a high caliber and lasting quality of development. These standards establish a 
common design language for nonresidential development. These standards also are intended to 
attach the same or greater level of importance to the overall building design as is placed on the use 
contained within to facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community. 
b. ?Architectural standards & design. The purpose and intent of the Fuquay-Varina Building Type and 
Architectural Standards is to provide a method to create better design within the Town. The ultimate 
design of a building is in many ways an artistic expression and cannot be easily quantified or 
regulated; however, some basic design features of a building's exterior are essential and will go a 
long way toward improving the visual interest in a building's appearance from the street and adjacent 
properties. 
c. ?Design principles & objectives. The objective of these standards is to articulate clear community 
design principles that assist architects and engineers in understanding the Town's minimum 
architectural design standards, creating higher aesthetic appeal, increasing resale value and 
providing more stable property values. These standards do not dictate or limit design or style of a 
building, as architectural diversity is encouraged, but will encourage more thoughtful and 
aesthetically pleasing solutions to building designs at a minimum. 
d. ?Economic interest. The Town supports the position of well-maintained and harmonious 
developments are in the best economic development interest of all citizens and businesses of the 
Town. 


§ 9-1351. - Building functions & aesthetics. 
a. ?Pedestrian scale. Building designs shall emphasize the pedestrian scale at ground level, at 
entryways and along street frontages through the creative use of windows, doors, columns, canopies 
and awnings. 
b. ?Building features. Major building design features, such as but not limited to windows, shutters, vents, 
doors, entrances, awnings, canopies, roofs (pitch/design), eaves and parapets, shall incorporate the 
following standards: 
(1) ?Proportional design. The design of features is in proportion to one another. 
(2) ?Architectural style. Buildings shall be architecturally designed such that elements from different 
styles of architecture or time periods are not incongruently utilized on a single building or within 
a single development. 
c. ?Structural lines retained at street level. These structural lines of a building and its materials shall be 
retained at the street level, such as brick piers and columns, which shall be carried down to street 
level. 
d. ?Awnings & canopies. Awnings and canopies shall complement the color and material of the building 
to which they are affixed and other awnings and canopies on the same building. 
e. ?Massing. A single, large, dominant building mass shall be avoided. Where large structures are 
required, massing should be broken up through the use of setbacks, projecting and recessed 
elements, and similar design techniques. Changes in mass shall be related to entrances, windows, 
exterior architectural features such as columns and/or the organization of interior spaces and 
activities and not merely for cosmetic effect. 
f. ?Accessory structures. Accessory structures/uses outlined in the Land Development Ordinance that 
are ancillary to the principal building such as loading, trash containment, maintenance, storage and 
mechanical/electrical areas and uses, and the devices and equipment associated with these areas, 
shall be incorporated into the overall design, architecture and landscaping so that the visual and 
acoustic impacts of these functions and devices are fully contained out of view from adjacent 
properties and public streets or areas. 
g. ?Avoid monotony of design. Design of single- or multi-building projects shall avoid monotony of design 
by varying detail, form and siding to the maximum extent practicable, within the standards of this 
article, to provide visual interest. 
h. ?Building color. Building colors shall be used to facilitate blending with adjacent development or within 
a single development. 
i. ?Building materials elements. Building materials shall either be similar to the materials already being 
used in adjacent developments or within a single development, or if dissimilar materials are being 
proposed, other characteristics, such as scale, proportion, form, architectural detail, color and 
texture, shall be utilized to ensure that similarities exist to provide compatibility, despite the 
difference in materials. 
j. ?Varying architectural styles. In developments with multiple structures of varying architectural styles, 
the buildings shall be compatible by such means as a pattern of architectural features, similar scale 
and proportions and a consistent location of signage. 
k. ?Infill development. New infill development shall either be similar in size and height or, if larger, be 
articulated and massed that is proportional to the mass and scale of other structures on the same 
block, or in the same development. If several storefronts are located in one building, the individual 
storefronts shall be unified in all exterior design elements such as mass, window and door 
placement, colors, materials and signage identifying the building and/or uses. 
l. ?Additions & renovations. A building addition(s) 40 percent or less of the square footage of the existing 
building, and/or façade renovations, may be designed to reflect the existing building(s) in scale, 
materials, window treatment and color. A change in material or color may require a transitional 
design element between the new building/development and existing building. Where the proposed 
building addition or façade renovation is within 100 feet of a thoroughfare classification Type 7 or 
greater semi-opaque landscaping, via a Type B buffer, shall be required and provided in accordance 
with Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards. For purposes of this section, additions shall 
be considered cumulatively. Where a building addition greater than 40 percent of the square footage 
of the existing building(s) footprint or a new freestanding structure/building is proposed, such addition 
or new freestanding structure/building shall meet the architectural design standards, materials and 
color standards of this article. 
( Ord. No. PZ-17-01 , § 4, 4-3-2017) 


§ 9-1352. - Applicability. 
a. ?Architecture & building type. 
(1) ?Application. Design standards shall apply to all infill, redevelopment, major rehabilitation and 
new multi-family and nonresidential developments. See Appendix A DC-1 & DC-2 Form-Based 
Districts for architectural standards for architectural standards for the Downtown Center-1 (DC-
1) and Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning Districts. 
(2) ?Major rehabilitation. Rehabilitation includes change in building façade material, change in roof 
structure, change of doors and/or windows or any rehabilitation that is more than 25 percent of 
the assessed value of the structure, with such cost aggregated over a five-year period to 
determine whether the development is subject to these standards. Major rehabilitation shall not 
include routine maintenance and repair of a structure or the surrounding site such as roof 
replacement or general repairs to parking areas, windows, doors or other building or site 
features unless otherwise provided by the Land Development Ordinance. See Article S 
Interpretations & Definitions, section 9-1901, m.(3). 
b. ?Integrated centers. For purposes of this article, the term "integrated center" shall include any 
development where multiple uses are located, multiple buildings are constructed or where any other 
common property is subdivided and developed, and which are related to one another in terms of 
architecture, landscaping or other features which create a uniform design. This includes but is not 
limited to mixed-use developments, shopping centers, office parks, industrial parks and campuses. 


§ 9-1353. - Development types. 
The Town has experienced a number of conventional development types, including apartment 
complexes, strip commercial development, office/business/industrial parks and the revitalization of the 
downtown. In order to provide quality growth throughout the Town, architectural standards are applied 
based on a hierarchy from greatest impact to least impact for nonresidential and multi-family 
developments. Because of the impact on the Town of different development types, the architectural and 
design standards applied in the Land Development Ordinance provides control relative to the intensity 
and impact of development. The following architectural standards for different development types shall 
apply: 
a. ?Commercial development types. 
 
(1) ?Community CenterMost Intense. 
(2) ?Neighborhood Center. 
(3) ?Convenience Center. 
(4) ?Corner Store (Single Use)Least Intense. 
b. ?Residential development types. 
 
(1) ?Mixed-Use DevelopmentMost Intense. 
(2) ?Multi-family. 
(3) ?Townhouse. 
(4) ?Quadplex & TriplexLeast Intense. 
c. ?Industrial, research & development parks & single use sites. Each industrial lot or industrial 
business park shall meet the architectural standards and building types as prescribed in this 
article. 


§ 9-1354. - Architectural & design requirements. 
a. ?Applicable architectural standards for certain uses. The architectural and site design requirements in 
the Land Development Ordinance shall be applicable to all nonresidential, mixed-use and multi-
family uses, and all residential uses allowed under an adopted master plan. Architectural and design 
requirements shall not apply to one- and two-family dwellings, as defined by the North Carolina State 
Building Code, when located in the Resource Conservation (RC) Zoning District, Residential 
Agricultural (RA) Zoning District, Residential Low Density (RLD) Zoning District, Residential Medium 
Density (RMD) Zoning District and/or the Residential High Density (RHD) Zoning District. 
b. ?Review for architectural & design standards. Architectural and design requirements shall be applied 
as part of the normal review process pursuant to Article Q Procedures & Administration of the Land 
Development Ordinance. 
c. ?General building façade materials. 
(1) ?Building façades. Building façade material standards shall apply to all nonresidential uses and 
residential uses as identified in subsection a. Architectural & Design Requirements of this 
section. 
(2) ?Building façade material. The primary building façade material is required on all sides of a 
principal building adjacent to or visible from a public right-of-way, except as otherwise provided 
in the Land Development Ordinance (excluding windows, display windows, doors, roofing, 
fascia or soffit materials) and shall be selected using one or more of the following materials: 
A. ?Standard brick or "quick" brick. 
B. ?Stone (e.g. natural/cultured, limestone, marble or granite). 
C. ?Split face block. 
D. ?Architectural concrete (surface is designed to simulate brick or stone). 
E. ?Wood. 
F. ?Fiber cemented or hardiplank siding. 
(3) ?Prohibited building façade materials. The following exterior building façade materials shall be

A. ?Vinyl siding. 
B. ?Smooth faced concrete block. 
C. ?Painted or stained concrete (including concrete block without architectural surface). 
D. ?Metal siding. 
E. ?Plastic. 
F. ?Stucco or EIFS (exterior installation finishing system) (except that a maximum of 20 
percent of a single building façade wall may be permitted for accent, trim or architectural 
features). 
(4) ?Roofs for all nonresidential buildings & structures. The following standards shall apply for roofs 
and roof structures: 
A. ?Roof pitch. Roof pitches less than 3 by 12 and flat roofs shall require a parapet wall, except 
as otherwise provided in the Land Development Ordinance. 
B. ?Parapet wall. If a parapet wall is proposed, the parapet wall shall extend around the entire 
building roof and shall be finished to match the front, side and rear façades.

Historical note The provisions of this article are derived from an ordinance of October 2, 
1978. 
b. ?Findings of fact. 
(1) ?Fact # 1. The flood hazard areas of Fuquay-Varina are subject to periodic inundation which 
results in loss of life and property; health and safety hazards; disruption of commerce and 
governmental services; extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief; and 
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general 
welfare. 
(2) ?Fact #2. These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, 
causing increases in flood heights and velocities; and by the occurrence in flood hazard areas 
by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, 
floodproofed or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
c. ?Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of the flood damage prevention regulations to promote the 
public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood 
conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1) ?Restrict or prohibit uses. Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and 
property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in 
flood heights or velocities. 
(2) ?Vulnerable uses. Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such 
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction. 
(3) ?Control alterations. Control the alteration of the natural floodplains, stream channels and 
natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accumulation of floodwaters. 
(4) ?Control earth moving. Control filling, grading, dredging and other development, which may 
increase erosion or flood damage.

B. ?Development in flood hazard soil locations involving less than five acres of drainage 
area are exempt from all flood hazard soil area regulations in this section. 
c. ?Drainage area of five or more but less than 25 acres. Development within flood hazard soils 
locations involving five or more acres but less than 25 acres of drainage area shall be subject to 
the following standards: 
(1) ?Natural conditions. All relevant information related to development occurring adjacent to a 
flood hazard soils area but not encroaching into the area must be certified by a licensed 
professional land surveyor. The certification must be based on the Wake County Soils Map 
which will be adjusted to conform to the Wake County Topographic Maps. Alternatively, the 
certification may be based upon the results of field investigations, surveys and engineering 
studies conducted by appropriate professionals if found to be acceptable by the 
Department of Environmental Services. The licensed professional land surveyor must 
establish the limits of the flood hazard soil area based on the adjusted soils map and the 
proposed property lines. 
(2) ?Modified conditions. Encroachments into a flood hazard soils area must be designed and 
certified by an appropriate design professional. The design must be based upon the 
establishment of a temporary or permanent benchmark and an analysis of the effects of 
the proposed encroachment to establish a base flood elevation or depth of flow, using 
Manning's Equation, field surveyed cross-sections including channel slope, Wake County 
Topographic Maps, and, where appropriate, use of Culvert Headwater Charts. No 
benchmarks are required when establishing a depth of flow. A minimum of two vertical feet 
must be added to the calculated base flood elevation or depth of flow to provide a factor of 
safety due to the potential backwater effects of the encroachment. The analysis must 
conclude that no existing or proposed structures or off-site properties will be inundated by 
the base flood. As-built certification of compliance with the construction drawings must be 
provided prior to receiving a footing inspection from the Town of Fuquay-Varina 
Inspections Department on any structures on any lots involved in the analysis. The as-built 
certification with the construction drawings is in addition to any elevation certifications 
which may be required for the structures. 
d. ?Drainage area of 25 or more but less than 100 acres. Developments within flood hazard soil 
locations involving 25 acres or more of drainage area but less than 100 acres of drainage area 
shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(1) ?Natural conditions. Certification is required in accordance with subsection c. Drainage 
Area of Five or More but Less Than 25 Acres, (1) Natural Conditions above. 
(2) ?Modified conditions. Encroachments into a flood hazard soils area must be designed and 
certified by an appropriate design professional. The design must be based upon the 
establishment of a temporary or permanent benchmark and an analysis of the effects of 
the proposed encroachment to establish a base flood elevation or depth of flow; using 
Manning's Equation, field surveyed cross-sections, including channel slope, Wake County 
Topographic Maps and, where appropriate, use of Culvert Headwater Charts. No 
benchmarks are required when establishing a depth of flow. A minimum of two vertical feet 
must be added to the calculated base flood elevation or depth of flow to provide a factor of 
safety due to the potential backwater effects of the encroachment. The analysis must 
conclude that no existing or proposed structures, or off-site properties will be inundated by 
the base flood. As-built certification of compliance with the construction drawings must be 
provided prior to receiving a footing inspection from the Town of Fuquay-Varina 
Inspections Department on any structures on any lots involved in the analysis. The as-built 
certification with the construction drawings is in addition to any elevation certifications 
which may be required for the structures. 
e. ?Drainage area of 100 acres or more. Developments within flood hazard soil locations involving 
100 acres or more of drainage area shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(1) ?Natural conditions. Certification is required in accordance with subsection c. Drainage 
Area of Five or More but Less Than 25 Acres, (1) Natural Conditions above. 
(2) ?Modified conditions. Encroachments into a flood hazard soils area must be designed and 
certified by an appropriate design professional. The design must be based upon the 
establishment of a temporary or permanent benchmark based on National Geodetic 
Vertical Datum and an analysis of the effects of the proposed encroachment to establish a 
base flood elevation; using Manning's Equation, the Standard Step Method to analyze 
backwater effect, field surveyed cross-sections including channel slope and, where 
appropriate, use of Culvert Headwater Charts. The analysis must conclude that no existing 
or proposed structures or off-site properties will be inundated by the base flood. As-built 
certification of compliance with the construction drawings must be provided prior to 
receiving a footing inspection from the Town of Fuquay-Varina Inspections Department on 
any structures on any lots involved in the analysis. The as-built certification with the 
construction drawings is in addition to any elevation certifications which may be required 
for the structures. 
f. ?Farm pond on bona fide farm. Development of farm ponds as part of a bona fide farm use in 
flood hazard soil locations shall either comply with the provisions above, as appropriate to the 
size of the drainage area, or shall comply with the following alternative requirements: 
(1) ?Natural conditions. Certification is required in accordance with subsectio nc. Drainage 
Area of Five or More but Less Than 25 Acres, (1) Natural Conditions above. 
(2) ?Modified conditions. Farm ponds shall be designed and constructed such that no off-site 
properties will experience an increase in flood elevations resulting from the 100-year storm 
event, unless the property is obtained or controlled through a recorded easement in favor 
of the party introducing the use. Any dam(s) must comply with all State and Federal laws 
and regulations, including the Dam Safety Law of 1967 (G.S. 143-215.23143-215.37). 
g. ?Modification provisions. 
(1) ?Field investigation. Flood hazard soil boundaries may be modified by field investigation by 
a soil scientist. The report of the field investigation must conclude with a description of the 
actual soil horizons which were encountered on the site. These soils must be placed in a 
soil complex or major soil association as prescribed by the standards and guidelines of the 
American Registry of Certified Professionals in Agronomy, Crops and Soils, or by the 
Town. 
(2) ?Flood study. Where the property owner/developer initiates a flood study, whether required 
or not, the flood study shall supersede the existing flood hazard soils area, determined by 
the Wake County Soils Map, as a factor in determining the developable property. The flood 
study determination of floodway and flood fringe shall be the basis for addressing 
development impacts in compliance with this section. Flood studies, prepared and certified 
by a design professional as appropriate for their licensing, may supersede existing flood 
hazard soil boundary designations when approved by the Town. Base flood elevation 
studies may be prepared only by licensed professional engineers.

extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ) are hereby divided into the following area(s) as appropriate: 
(1) ?Watershed areas describedWS-IV (PA) Watershed Protected Area. Only new development 
activities that require an erosion and sedimentation control plan under State law or local 
government regulations are required to meet the provisions of the watershed protection 
regulations when located in a WS-IV watershed. In order to address a moderate to high land 
use intensity pattern, single-family residential uses shall be developed at a maximum of two 
dwelling units per acre. All other residential and nonresidential development shall be allowed at 
a maximum of 24 percent built-upon area. A maximum of three dwelling units per acre or 36 
percent built-upon area is allowed for development without a curbed and guttered street system. 
(2) ?Uses permitted. 
A. ?Agriculture uses. Agriculture, subject to the provisions of the Food Security Act of 1985 
and the Food, Agricultural, Conservation & Trade Act of 1990. 
B. ?Silviculture uses. Silviculture, subject to the provisions of the Forest Practices Guidelines 
Related to Water Quality (15 NCAC 11.6101-.0209). 
C. ?Residential uses. The following density and built-upon limits shall apply: 
i. ?Single-family residential development. A single-family residential development shall not 
exceed two dwelling units per acre, as defined on a development by development 
basis. No residential lot shall be less than one-half acre or one-third acre for projects 
without a curbed and guttered street systems, except within an approved open space 
development (cluster development) in accordance with Article F Use Regulations 
section 9-1255, Article F, Use Regulations, l. Development Projects, (4). 
ii. ?Other residential development. All other residential developments shall not exceed 24 
percent built-upon area for each development. For developments without a curbed 
and guttered street system, the development shall not exceed 36 percent built-upon 
area for each development. For the purpose of calculating the built-upon area, total 
development area shall include acreage in the track on which the development is to 
be constructed. 
(3) ?Open space development. The watershed protection standards shall apply to an open space 
development within a watershed area. Open space developments are allowed in the WS-IV 
Watershed Area under the following standards: 
A. ?Lot size & built-upon area. Minimum lot sizes are not applicable to single-family open 
space developments; however, the total number of lots shall not exceed the total number 
of lots allowed for single-family detached developments required in section 9-1403 
Watershed Protection Regulations, k. Development Regulations, (1) Watershed Areas 
Described, above. Built-upon area or stormwater management control regulations for the 
development shall not exceed that allowed for the critical area or balance of watershed, 
whichever applies. 
B. ?Minimize water runoff & concentration. All built-upon area shall be designed and located to 
minimize stormwater runoff impact to the receiving waters and minimize concentrated 
stormwater flow. 
C. ?Open space area. The remainder of the tract/property shall remain as an open space area 
in a vegetative or natural state. Where the development has pending corporative property 
owners association (homeowners association), the title of the open space area shall be 
conveyed to the homeowners association and is not incorporated, a maintenance 
agreement shall be filed with the property deed(s). 
(4) ?Buffer areas required. The following buffer requirements shall apply: 
A. ?Riparian buffers. A minimum 50-foot vegetative buffer for development activities is required 
along all intermittent and perennial waters indicated on the most recent versions of 
U.S.G.S. 1:24,000 (7.5 minute) scale topographic maps identified as a blue line stream, or 
as determined by Wake County soil maps, or as may be determined by local studies and 
documentation. Desirable artificial stream bank or shoreline stabilization is permitted. 
B. ?Protection of buffers. No new development or expansion is allowed in the buffer except for 
water dependent structures and public projects such as road crossing, greenways and 
sewer and water utility lines where no practical alternative exists. These activities should 
minimize built-upon surface area, direct run-off away from the surface waters and 
maximize the utilization of stormwater best management practices (BMPs). 
(5) ?Rules governing the interpretation of watershed area boundaries. Where uncertainty exists as 
to the interpretation of the boundaries of the watershed areas, as shown on the watershed map, 
the following rules shall apply: 
A. ?Visual boundaries. Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following 
streets, alleys, railroad or highway centerlines thereof, such lines shall be construed to be 
said boundaries of the watershed area. 
B. ?Lot line or surveyed line. Where area boundaries are indicated as approximately following 
lot lines, such lot lines shall be construed to be said boundaries of the watershed area. 
However, a surveyed plat prepared by a registered land surveyor may be submitted to the 
Town as evidence that one or more properties along these boundaries do not lie within the 
watershed area. 
C. ?Scaled distance more than 25 feet. Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled 
distance more than 25 feet from any parallel lot line, the location of the watershed area 
boundaries shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the watershed map. 
D. ?Scaled distance of 25 feet or less. Where the watershed area boundaries lie at a scaled 
distance of 25 feet or less from any parallel lot line, the location of the watershed area 
boundaries shall be construed to be the lot line. 
E. ?Interpretation. Where other uncertainties exist, the Planning Director or his/her designee 
shall interpret the watershed map as to the location of such boundaries. This decision may 
be appealed to the Board of Adjustment in accordance with Article Q Procedures & 
Administration. 
(6) ?Application of regulations. The application of regulations within a watershed protection area 
shall be in accordance with the following: 
A. ?Compliance with regulations. No building or land shall hereafter be used and no 
development shall take place except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for 
the watershed area in which it is located. 
B. ?Areas independent of other areas. No area required for the purpose of complying with the 
provisions of the watershed protection regulations shall be included in the area required for 
another building. 
C. ?Residential buildings. Every residential building hereafter erected, moved or structurally 
altered shall be located on a lot which conforms to the regulations herein specified, except 
as permitted in section 9-1403 Watershed Protection Regulations, k. Development 
Regulations, (6). 
D. ?Prohibited uses. If a use or class of use is not specifically indicated as being permitted in a 
watershed area, such use or class of use is prohibited. 
(7) ?Existing development. Any existing development, as defined in Article S Interpretations & 
Definitions, may be continued and maintained subject to the provisions provided herein. 
Expansions to structures classified as existing development must meet the requirements of the 
watershed protection regulations; however, the built-upon area of the existing development is 
not required to be included in the density calculations. In addition, categories of existing 
conditions shall apply to the watershed protection regulations as follows: 
A. ?Vacant lots. This category consists of vacant lots for which plats or deeds have been 
recorded in the office of the Register of Deeds for Wake County. Lots may be used for any 
of the uses allowed in the watershed area in which it is located provided the following: 
i. ?Lots below minimum regulations. Where the lot area is below the minimum specified in 
these regulations, the Planning Director or his/her designee is authorized to issue a 
watershed protection permit. 
ii. ?Lots in single ownership. Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever two or more 
contiguous residential vacant lots of record are in single ownership at any time after 
the adoption of the Land Development Ordinance and such lots individually have less 
area than the minimum requirements for residential purposes for the watershed area 
in which such lots are located, such lots shall be combined to create one or more lots 
that meet the standards of the watershed protection regulations, or if this is 
impossible, reduce to the extent possible the nonconformity of the lots. 
B. ?Occupied lots. This category consists of lots, occupied for residential purposes at the time 
of the adoption of the Land Development Ordinance. These lots may continue to be used 
provided that whenever two or more adjoining lots of record, one of which is occupied are 
in single ownership at any time after the adoption of the Land Development Ordinance, and 
such lots individually or collectively have less area than the minimum requirements for 
residential purposes for the watershed area in which they are located, such lots shall be 
combined to create lots which meet the minimum size required or which minimizes the 
degree of nonconformity. 
C. ?Uses of land. This category consists of uses existing at the time of adoption of the Land 
Development Ordinance where such use of the land is not permitted to be established

It is referred to herein as "Phase II requirements." 
(2) ?Authority. The Town Board of Fuquay-Varina is authorized to adopt these Phase II 
requirements pursuant to North Carolina law, including but not limited to Article 14, Section 5 of 
the Constitution of North Carolina; the Charter and Other Related Laws of the Town of Fuquay-
Varina; G.S. 143-214.7 and rules promulgated by the Environmental Management Commission 
thereunder; Session Law 2004-163; Chapter 160A, §§ 174, 185. 
(3) ?Findings. It is hereby determined that: 
A. ?Alteration of hydrologic. Development and redevelopment alter the hydrologic response of 
local watersheds and increases stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, soil 
erosion, stream channel erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution, and sediment 
transport and deposition, as well as reducing groundwater recharge. 
B. ?Increased quantities of water-borne pollutants. These changes in stormwater runoff 
contribute to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants and alterations in hydrology 
which are harmful to public health and safety as well as to the natural environment. 
C. ?Apply proper design controls & management. These effects can be managed and 
minimized by applying proper design and well-planned controls to manage stormwater 
runoff from development sites. 
D. ?Federal & State regulations. Further, the Federal Water Pollution Control Act of 1972 
("Clean Water Act") and Federal Phase II Stormwater Rules promulgated under it, as well 
as rules of the North Carolina Environmental Management Commission promulgated in 
response to Federal Phase II Regulations, compel certain urbanized areas, including this 
jurisdiction, to adopt the minimum stormwater controls such as those included in these 
Phase II requirements. 
E. ?Regulations established. Therefore, the Town Board of Fuquay-Varina establishes this set 
of water quality and quantity regulations to meet the requirements of State and Federal law 
regarding control of stormwater runoff and discharge. 
(4) ?Purpose. The purpose of the Phase II Stormwater Requirements are as follows: 
A. ?General. The purpose of the Phase II Stormwater Requirements is to protect, maintain and 
enhance the public health, safety, environment and general welfare by establishing 
minimum requirements and procedures to control the adverse effects of increased post-
developmentstormwater runoff and nonpoint and point source pollution associated with 
new development and redevelopment as well as illicit discharges into municipal stormwater 
systems. It has been determined that proper management of construction-related and post-
development stormwater runoff will minimize damage to public and private property and 
infrastructure, safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare and protect water 
and aquatic resources. 
B. ?Specific. The Phase II requirements seeks to meet its general purpose through the 
following specific objectives and means: 
i. ?Decision-making processes. Establishing decision-making processes for development 
that protects the integrity of watersheds and preserves the health of water resources. 
ii. ?Maintain pre-development hydrologic. Requiring that new development and 
redevelopment maintain the pre-development hydrologic response in their post-
development state as nearly as practicable for the applicable design storm in order to 
reduce flooding, stream bank erosion, nonpoint and point source pollution and 
increases in stream temperature, and to maintain the integrity of stream channels and 
aquatic habitats. 
iii. ?Minimum post-development stormwater. Establishing minimum post-development 
stormwater management standards and design criteria for the regulation and control 
of stormwater runoff quantity and quality. 
iv. ?Design & review criteria. Establishing design and review criteria for the construction, 
function and use of structural stormwater BMPs that may be used to meet the 
minimum post-development stormwater management standards. 
v. ?Better management & site design practices. Encouraging the use of better 
management and site design practices, such as the use of vegetated conveyances for 
stormwater and the preservation of green space and other conservation areas to the 
maximum extent practicable. 
vi. ?Long-term responsibility. Establishing provisions for the long-term responsibility for 
and maintenance of structural and nonstructural stormwater best management 
practices (BMPs) to ensure that they continue to function as designed, are maintained 
appropriately and pose no threat to public safety. 
vii. ?Administrative procedures. Establishing administrative procedures for the 
submission, review, approval and disapproval of stormwater management plans, for 
the inspection of approved projects, and to assure appropriate long-term 
maintenance. 
viii. ?Coordinate with open space plan & open space developments. Coordinating site 
design plans that include open space and natural areas within open space 
developments, and the "Fuquay-Varina Open Space Plan." 
ix. ?Control illicit discharges. Controlling illicit discharges into the municipality's separate 
stormwater system.

the perimeter of the property as defined in Article S Interpretations & Definitions, section 9-1901 
General Definitions, except for necessary ingress and egress as permitted in these regulations. 
(2) ?Removing or altering perimeter buffer area. Once a site plan or major subdivision plan has 
been reviewed and approved by the Town, the "perimeter buffer area" may be removed or 
altered in accordance with the Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards and the 
approved plan under the following regulations: 
A. ?Property ten acres or greater. With regard to property ten acres or greater, existing 
heritage trees shall be identified within the perimeter buffer area and included with the 
submittal of a site plan indicating what impact retaining the trees will have on the proposed 
plan. For each heritage tree defined in Article S Interpretations & Definitions, section 9-

shade tree, three-inch caliper minimum, for every ten inches of heritage tree caliper 
removed, and must be in addition to and supplement the street tree planting requirement in 
accordance with Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection or landscape requirements in 
parking lots in accordance with Article N Parking, Loading & Lighting Design Standards. 
B. ?Major subdivisions. Existing heritage tree(s) shall be identified within the perimeter buffer 
area for major subdivisions where the proposed development is adjacent to a street or 
highway identified on the Town's adopted Community Transportation Plan (also identified 
as the Thoroughfare Plan) and the Thoroughfare Collector Street Plan. For each heritage 
tree defined in Article S Interpretations & Definitions, section 9-1901 General Definitions 
within the perimeter buffer area that must be removed, one shade tree, three-inch caliper 
minimum, shall be installed for every ten inches of heritage tree caliper removed and shall 
be in addition to and supplement the "perimeter buffer area" and/or the street tree planting 
requirement in accordance with Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection as part of the 
approved subdivision plan. 
C. ?Preserving existing heritage trees. As an alternative to subsections A. and B. above, if an 
existing heritage tree is preserved for each existing heritage tree that is removed within the 
perimeter buffer area or within the site, then the replacement requirement shall not apply. 
D. ?Identifying heritage trees with a forest management plan. Prior to any execution of a forest 
management plan or clear-cutting operation, the property owner/developer shall submit a 
general location map of existing heritage tree(s) within the perimeter buffer area to the 
Town. However, if a forest management plan or boundary map is submitted to the Town 
indicating that the perimeter buffer area shall not be disturbed other than necessary 
access, than a location map of existing heritage tree(s) within the perimeter buffer area 
shall not be required. The location map will include the species and size in caliper and 
should be prepared by a professional in the field of horticulture such as a landscape 
architect, arborist or registered forester. The Town may conduct a field survey to verify the 
location, species and size of the heritage tree(s). Once the activity begins the perimeter 
buffer area must remain undisturbed until a site plan or major subdivision has been 
approved by the Town. 
E. ?Replacement of required trees. If, in the event, a proposed site plan or subdivision plan, 
regardless of the acreage, has difficulty locating the required number of trees to replace 
the removal of heritage tree(s) on a proposed plan, then the property owner/developer may 
request a review before the Town Board of Commissioners to consider an adjustment to 
the number of replacement trees required. The adjustment shall be based on topography, 
property shape or other existing physical conditions or requirements of the Land 
Development Ordinance, which impacts the development of the site. Such adjustment shall 
not have the effect of nullifying the intended purpose of the clear-cutting and protection of 
heritage trees regulations. 
(3) ?Required grading plan in perimeter buffer area. Grading (cuts or fills) shall not be permitted 
within the perimeter buffer area without approval of a grading plan by the Town prior to Wake 
County issuing a grading permit. Where grading does occur within the "perimeter buffer area" in 
accordance with an approved grading plan, no grading shall be extended into the perimeter 
buffer area more than one-half the width of the "perimeter buffer area." 
(4) ?Protection of perimeter buffer area. The identified perimeter buffer area as provided on an 
approved site plan or major subdivision plan shall be protected during clearing and cleanup 
activities with tree protection fencing appropriately located at or beyond the drip line of the 
tree(s) using standard practices and appropriate signage visible to the contractor and general 
public during construction. 
(5) ?Riparian buffers regulation supersede clear-cutting & protection of heritage trees regulations. 
The provisions of the clear-cutting and protection of heritage trees regulations shall not 
supersede but instead are in addition to the requirements of section 9-1404 Riparian Buffer 
Regulations.

(5) ?Land dedication & creation of a recreation fee credit agreement. Where the property 
owner/developer proposes to dedicate land or recreation purposes, the property 
owner/developer may enter into a recreation fee credit agreement in exchange for the property 
owner/developer conveying in fee simple to the Town contemporaneously certain land to 
comply with the required land dedication for recreation, and granting the property 
owner/developer the right to produce and issued vouchers in consideration of the dedication of 
the recreation land to apply against recreation fees that would otherwise be due under the Land 
Development Ordinance in accordance with the following standards: 
A. ?Recreation fee credit agreement. The property owner/developer and the Town agree to 
enter into a recreation fee credit agreement. 
B. ?Agreement responsibility. The property owner/developer shall be responsible to draft such 
agreement for review by the Town of Fuquay-Varina. 
C. ?Maximum value. The vouchers for the recreation land dedicated shall not exceed the total 
value of the maximum number of dwelling units proposed in the subdivision or a master 
plan based on $1,000.00 per dwelling unit or as may be adjusted in the future by the Town 
Board of Commissioners. 
D. ?Recreation vouchers. The property owner/developer shall have the right to produce and 
issue vouchers (recreation vouchers) to individual builders, and for the individual builder to 
submit such voucher to the Town at the time a building permit is submitted for the 
construction of a dwelling unit on a lot. 
E. ?Building permit & voucher. The recreation voucher shall identify to the Town that the 
builder shall not be required to pay the recreation fee associated with a building permit. 
F. ?When vouchers shall not apply. Where the total number of lots within a subdivision or 
master plan exceeds the recreation credit for the land dedicated the surplus lots shall not 
be subject to a recreation voucher, but such lots shall be subject to the recreation fee as 
required at the time a building permit is submitted for approval and the building permit fees 
are paid. 
c. ?Payment in lieu of dedication of land. 
(1) ?Owner/developer request. The payment of a fee, in lieu of dedication of land, may occur at the 
request of the property owner/developer for a proposed subdivision. The payment, in lieu of 
land dedication, shall occur if the Town Board of Commissioners determines that the proposed 
dedication of property does not conform to the recreation and park needs in accordance with 
the current Parks, Recreational and Cultural Resources Master Plan, or if the dedication of land 
is less than one acre. 
(2) ?Completed application. The process of determining payment of a recreation fee, in-lieu of land 
dedication, shall be part of the review process for a preliminary major subdivision plat or a 
master plan for a Planned Unit Development Zoning District, Town Center Residential Zoning 
District or RMU, NMU and UMU Form-Based Zoning Districts. The property owner/developer 
shall complete a form provided by the Town requesting to apply the recreation payment-in-lieu 
of land dedication and submit the form along with the initial submittal of a preliminary major 
subdivision plat or master plan. The process to receive final action on the form requesting a 
payment-in-lieu of land dedication shall be considered at the same time that the Town Board of 
Commissioners take action on the preliminary major subdivision plat in accordance with Article 
Q Procedures & Administration. 
(3) ?Recreation fee basis. The payment of a recreation fee, in lieu of land dedication, shall be based 
on the fair market value of the land that is to be developed. The fair market value, for the 
purposes of the Land Development Ordinance, shall be the market value of the track, after the 
proposed final subdivision plat is recorded, without consideration of any infrastructure 
improvements (including, but not limited to, streets, utilities, recreation facilities and the like). 
The value of the amount of land that would be required to be dedicated under Article J, 
Subdivision Regulations, section 9-1462 Recreation Standards, a. Authorization shall be 
determined by the per acre value of the entire parcel of land multiplied by the acreage amount 
of the required dedicated land. The recreation fee, to be paid in lieu of land dedication, shall be 
equal to the fair market value of the land that would have been dedicated. In the fiscal year in 
which the amendment to Article J, Subdivision Regulations, section 9-1462 Recreation 
Standards was previously amended (March 21, 2006, and January 17, 2012) took effect, the 
minimum amount in determining the fair market value of the parcel of land to be developed shall 
not yield a payment in lieu of land dedication of less than $750.00 per dwelling unit. The 
maximum amount in determining the fair market value of a parcel of land shall not yield a 
payment in lieu of land dedication of more than $1,000.00 per dwelling unit. In any subsequent 
fiscal year, the Town Board of Commissioners, after a duly advertised public hearing, may 
annually lower or raise the minimum and/or maximum amount of the fair market value per acre 
for the recreation fee in lieu of land dedication for proposed subdivisions that is applicable to the 
Land Development Ordinance. 
(4) ?Appraisal requirement. If the property owner/developer of the proposed subdivision proposes a 
recreation payment, in lieu of land dedication, that is less than the maximum ($1,000.00 per 
dwelling unit) for that fiscal year, an appraisal (licensed by the State of North Carolina) of the 
parcel of land that is to be developed shall be submitted to the Town. The Town may accept the 
appraisal and compute the payment of the recreation fee, in lieu of land dedication, based on 
the appraisal's findings. If the Town does not accept the value contained in the submitted 
appraisal report, the Town of Fuquay-Varina shall conduct an appraisal of the parcel of land (at 
the Town's expense) that is to be developed within 30 days of receipt of the property 
owner's/developer's appraisal. For the purposes of the Land Development Ordinance, the fair 
market value of a parcel of land to be used in calculating the recreation payment, in lieu of land 
dedication, shall be the midpoint between the value indicated in the property 
owner's/developer's appraisal and the value indicated in the Town's appraisal. 
(5) ?Payment-in-lieu of dedication required at final plat recording. The property owner/developer 
shall be required to pay the recreation fee, in lieu of land dedication, and prior to receiving the 
final subdivision plat for recording purposes. If the Town of Fuquay-Varina accepts a 
combination of a recreation fee and land dedication, the recreation fee portion shall be paid 
prior to receiving the final subdivision plat for recording purposes. 
d. ?Use of recreation payment-in-lieu of land dedication. Any recreation fees received in accordance with 
Article J, Subdivision Regulations, section 9-1462 Recreation Standards, c. Payment-In-Lieu of 
Dedication of Land shall be accounted for in a Special Revenue Fund that is separate from the 
General Fund for Town operations. The funds in this special revenue fund may only be expended for 
the acquisition or development of recreation, parks or open space, pursuant to G.S. 160A-372. The 
recreation fees paid into this fund shall be tracked to assure that the acquisition of or development of 
recreation, parks, or open space, is occurring within the "immediate area" (see section 9-1462 
Recreation Standards, b. Dedication of Land for Recreation Areas or Facilities, (2) Maximum 
Distance for Off-Site Land Dedication) of the subdivision or master plan from which the recreation 
fees were paid into the fund. 
e. ?Effective date, transition of calculation & payment of recreation fees in lieu of land dedication. 
(1) ?Effective date. Article J, Subdivision Regulations, section 9-1462 Recreation Standards shall 
be effective upon adoption of the Land Development Ordinance. The land dedication or 
recreation fee payment required in whole or part comes forward by reenactment of all or some 
of the provisions of the subdivision regulations, and it is not the intention to repeal but rather to 
reenact and continue enforcement, without interruption, such existing provisions, so that all 
rights and liabilities that have occurred thereafter are reserved and may be enforced.

Deeds until all required on-site and off-site improvements have been constructed in 
accordance with the Town Code, Land Development Ordinance and Standard 
Specifications & Construction Details (as now promulgated and hereafter amended from 
time to time), or in lieu of such improvements, but will be necessary in the future, the Town 
Board of Commissioners may, as a condition of the preliminary subdivision plat, approve a 
payment in lieu of improvements under the conditions and procedures as applied herein to 
the Town of Fuquay-Varina in an amount equal to the total estimated cost plus 25 percent 
of all surveying, engineering designs and plans, regulatory permitting, regulatory mitigation 
cost, administration/mobilization, testing and inspection of construction work, utility

that has not been installed. 
A. ?Conditions for consideration. A payment in lieu is an option that may be considered 
based on the Land Development Ordinance, adopted Town policies and the Town 
Code, and will only be considered under the following conditions: 
i. ?Improvements permitted for payment in lieu. If, in the case of a thoroughfare 
identified on the Town Community Transportation Plan and Thoroughfare Plan 
which require improvements according to the Land Development Ordinance and 
the Town Standard Specifications & Construction Details, certain aspects of the 
improvements may be considered only in the case where public safety is 
impacted based on a specific engineering design condition(s). It is not the intent 
nor is it acceptable to request a payment in lieu to remove or eliminate required 
thoroughfare improvements that has been adopted in the Town Community 
Transportation Plan and Thoroughfare Plan and in accordance with the Town's 
Standard Specifications & Construction Details without meeting specified public 
safety issues. 
ii. ?Stream crossings. A thoroughfare or street that terminates at a property line and 
said property line is the centerline of a stream or creek that falls under Federal,

thoroughfare improvements along US 401, NC 55 and NC 42 if it is determined 
that a proposed development project along the aforementioned thoroughfares will 
be impacted by a pending or proposed NCDOT project. The greater 
consideration will be given to development projects adjacent to or immediately 
impacted by a funded NCDOT project. A project is considered funded if it is 
included in the NCDOT State Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). The 
process for consideration of a payment in lieu of thoroughfare improvements 
shall follow the requirements as provided herein. 
v. ?The Town Board of Commissioners may consider a payment in lieu for 
improvements or an exception of improvements adjacent to a North Carolina 
State Highway if it is determined that a new development or expansion along 
federal or North Carolina State Highway thoroughfares will be impacted by a 
pending or proposed NCDOT project. Greater consideration will be given to 
development projects adjacent to or immediately impacted by a funded NCDOT 
project. A project is considered funded if it is included in the North Carolina State 
Transportation Improvement Program (STIP). The process for consideration of a 
payment-in-lieu shall follow the STIP provisions and Town Board approval as 
outlined in Article Q Procedures & Administration, section 9-1808, z. Site Plan,

on adopted the Town Code and the Land Development Ordinance. The amount 
approved by the Town Board for a payment-in-lieu shall be the total and complete 
payment of all cost for engineering designs, regulatory permitting, regulatory 
mitigation cost, utility relocations, administration/mobilization, testing and inspection of 
construction work, and construction improvements based on approved plans, that will 
preclude further assessments to the property owner/developer in the event the Town

§§ 9-1469 THROUGH 9-1499. - Reserved. 


Article K - Nonconformities 


§ 9-1500. - Purpose & intent. 
Within the provisions established by the Land Development Ordinance, there exist uses of land, 
structures, lots and signs that were lawfully established before the Land Development Ordinance became 
effective (December 30, 2016), or as amended, that now do not conform to the terms, standards and/or 
regulations of the Land Development Ordinance. The purpose of this article is to regulate and limit the 
continued existence of those uses of land, structures, lots and signs that do not conform to the provisions 
of the Land Development Ordinance or as may be amended. The provisions of this article are designed to 
curtail substantial investment in nonconformities and to preserve the integrity of the Land Development 
Ordinance. 
It is the intent of the Land Development Ordinance to permit nonconformities to continue until the uses of 
land, structures, lots and signs are removed or brought into compliance with the Land Development 
Ordinance, but not to encourage their survival except under the limited circumstances established in this 
article. It is further the intent of the Land Development Ordinance that changes in size, use or purpose to 
continue nonconformities shall not be permitted except as regulated by this article. Further, the zoning 
violations are separate and apart from nonconformities as established by definition in accordance with the 
Land Development Ordinance 


§ 9-1501. - General provisions. 
a. ?Establishing a nonconformity. 
(1) ?Burden of proof. The burden of establishing any nonconformity is to be met by the owner(s) or 
party seeking to continue the use of land, structure, lot or sign, or any person applying for a 
"certificate of zoning compliance." Such owner, person or party shall provide sufficient evidence 
in a form acceptable to the Planning Director or his/her designee based on the following: 
A. ?Date documentation. Proof of date of construction of the building or structure, or date the 
use was established (consisting of a certified copy of a business license or building permit 
application). 
B. ?Proof of continuous operation. Proof of continuous operation of the nonconforming use, 
consisting of affidavits signed by persons having personal knowledge of the use of the 
premises since the use was established. Continuous operation means the nonconforming 
use is occupying the structure or property, or open to the public, or operating under normal 
business hours on a day-to-day basis. A nonconforming use that has discontinued for the 
prescribed time in accordance with section 9-1502 Nonconforming Uses of this article shall 
only be used as a conforming use. Maintaining the utilities, services accounts or lease, but 
where the nonconforming use is no longer occupying the structure or property or the 
business use is no longer operating on a day to day basis under normal business hours 
shall not constitute a continuation of a nonconforming use. 
C. ?Additional documentation. Such additional documentation as may be deemed necessary 
or reasonable by the Planning Director or his/her designee. 
b. ?Relocation of a building or structure. No building or structure shall be moved in whole or in part to 
any other location on the same or any other lot unless every portion of such building or structure 
which is moved and the use thereof is made to conform to the regulations of the zoning district in 
which such building or structure is located in accordance with the Land Development Ordinance. 
c. ?Repairs pursuant to a public order. In order to accomplish and maintain the objectives of this article 
without posing any hazard to the public or occupants of any nonconforming buildings and structures, 
nothing in this article shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration of an unsafe 
structure in accordance with any order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public 
health, safety and welfare, and who finds that the structure which is the subject of the order is 
declared an unsafe structure in its present condition, and that repair or restoration is not in violation 
of the provisions of this article governing the restoration of partially damaged or destroyed structures 
and/or signs. 
d. ?Normal maintenance & repair. Normal maintenance and repair of structures where nonconforming 
uses and/or nonconforming structures are located may be permitted where maintenance is ordinary 
repairs of existing wiring, plumbing, mechanical, painting, water damage, insect damage, rotting or 
damage due to circumstances beyond the control of the property owner or nonconforming use. 
Maintenance or repairs performed are permitted in any 12 consecutive months, and to the extent that 
the maintenance or repairs do not exceed 50 percent of the current assessed value of the structure, 
and provided further that the structure existing after the date it became nonconforming shall not be 
increased or expanded, except pursuant to the regulations of this article. Any maintenance or repair 
in excess of 50 percent of the current assessed value of the structure shall be approved by the Town 
Board of Commissioners. 
e. ?Unsafe use due to lack of building maintenance. 
(1) ?Unsafe building. If a nonconforming structure or portion thereof containing a nonconforming 
use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to the lack of repairs or maintenance as 
determined by the Land Development Ordinance and the North Carolina State Building Code 
regulations, and is declared to be an unsafe structure, it shall thereafter be rebuilt and repaired 
in conformance with the standards of Land Development Ordinance or demolished with proper 
permits from the Town of Fuquay-Varina's Inspections Department. 
(2) ?Use of reconstructed building. The nonconforming use may reuse the same portion of the 
reconstructed building if occupied within two months (60 days) of the date of the issued 
certificate of occupancy, after which time only a conforming use shall be permitted within the 
zoning district in which the use is located. 


§ 9-1502. - Nonconforming uses. 
Nonconforming uses are generally not permitted and are incompatible with the Land Development 
Ordinance. Nonconforming uses may continue specifically in accordance with the provisions of this article 
as follows: 
a. ?Enlargement or expansion. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged or expanded or altered 
in any way as follows: 
(1) ?Structural or alteration changes. No structural or alteration changes shall be permitted 
which would increase the bulk of a building or structure housing a nonconforming use, 
unless such changes or alterations conform to all the provisions of the zoning district, the 
Land Development Ordinance and the North Carolina State Building Code regulations, in 
which such use is located. 
(2) ?No expansion of existing nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged 
or expanded beyond the area occupied, except that a nonconforming use may be enlarged 
in any area of the same structure in which it is manifestly designed for such use prior to the 
date of the use becoming a nonconforming use. 
(3) ?Conforming use conversion to a nonconforming use. A conforming use shall not convert in 
whole or part to a nonconforming use. 
b. ?Damage & restoration of a structure housing a nonconforming use. 
(1) ?Compliance after damage. Any nonconforming structure housing a nonconforming use 
that is damaged by any means to an extent exceeding a percentage of its reproducible 
value equal to 100 percent minus two percent per year for age of the structure, or 60 
percent, whichever is greater, shall comply with the use standards of the Land 
Development Ordinance when it is reconstructed. 
(2) ?Threshold to restore damaged nonconforming use. Any conforming structure housing a 
nonconforming use that is damaged by any means to a lesser extent based on subsection 
b.(1) above may continue the nonconforming use if it is reconstructed and used as before 
within one year of the date of the damage or the date when the damage was identified. A 
one-year extension may be granted with approval by the Town Board of Commissioners 
with cause. 
c. ?Change in nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other use, 
unless any new or additional uses conform to the provisions of the Land Development 
Ordinance for the zoning district in which the use is located. 
d. ?Discontinuance or abandonment. 
(1) ?Discontinued or abandoned. If a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a 
period of more than six consecutive months (180 days), whether or not any equipment or 
furniture are removed, then such use may not be reestablished or resumed, and any 
subsequent use shall conform to the provisions specified by the Land Development 
Ordinance in addition to the following: 
A. ?Government delay. When government action can be documented as the reason for 
discontinuance or abandonment, the time of delay by the government shall not be 
calculated for the purpose of determining the six consecutive months (180 days). 


§ 9-1503. - Nonconforming buildings & structures. 
A nonconforming building/structure devoted to a use permitted in the zoning district in which it is located 
at the time of its construction may continue in accordance with the provisions in this article. 
a. ?Enlargement or expansion. 
(1) ?Provision for enlargement or expansion. A nonresidential nonconforming structure shall 
not be enlarged or expanded in area occupied unless otherwise permitted in subsection 
a.(2) below. A residential nonconforming structure may enlarge or expand in part or whole 
so long as there is no increase to the nonconformity. 
(2) ?Nonconforming structures resulting from the adoption of ordinance. Structures with 
setbacks which were made nonconforming by the adoption of the Land Development 
Ordinance are exempt from the standards of Article G Lot & Structure Provisions, provided 
that: 
A. ?Addition or alteration. The proposed addition or alteration will either meet the current 
setback requirements or will not further encroach into any required setback of the 
existing structure, provided that such encroachment meets the North Carolina State 
Building Code regulations and does not exceed the height of the existing structure.

§ 9-1507. - Nonconforming signs. 
a. ?Notification of nonconformity. As soon as reasonably possible after the effective date of the Land 
Development Ordinance, December 30, 2016, the Planning Director or his/her designee shall make 
every reasonable effort to identify all the nonconforming signs within the Town's corporate limits and 
its extraterritorial jurisdiction (ETJ). The Planning Director or his/her designee shall then contact in 
writing the sign owner, property owner, or both who are responsible for such nonconforming sign(s) 
(and the owner(s) of the property where the nonconforming sign(s) is located if different than the 
person responsible for the sign) and inform such person(s) that: 
(1) ?Identify sign status. A field assessment was conducted to determine whether the sign is 
conforming or nonconforming. 
(2) ?Nonconformity. Information shall include how the sign is nonconforming based on square 
footage, height, setback, etc. 
(3) ?Abatement. Information identifying what must be done to correct the nonconformity and by a 
date specific. 
(4) ?Enforcement. The consequences of failing to make the necessary corrections to the 
nonconforming sign by the specific date. 
b. ?Removal of nonconforming signs. Subject to the regulations of the Land Development Ordinance 
and restrictions of this article, nonconforming signs that were otherwise lawful on December 30, 
2016, the effective date of the adoption of the amortization provisions, may continue in use until such 
signs are required to be removed in accordance with subsection j. Amortization of Nonconforming 
Signs of this section. 
c. ?Moving or replacing nonconforming signs. A nonconforming sign shall not be moved or replaced 
except to bring the sign into complete conformity with Article L Signs. 
d. ?Alteration of nonconforming signs. No person, owner, business, use, agency or any representative 
shall cause an increase in the extent of the nonconformity of a nonconforming sign so as to enlarge, 
alter or change the nonconforming sign in shape, location, illumination, size or in such a manner as 
to aggravate the nonconforming conditions. 
e. ?Repair & renovation of nonconforming signs. Subject to other provisions of this article, 
nonconforming signs may be repaired and renovated as long as the cost of such work does not 
exceed, within a continuous 12-month period, 50 percent of the value (tax value if listed for tax 
purposes) of such sign. Proof of value and a sign permit are required. If there is no tax value then 
such sign may be repaired and/or renovated up to but not exceeding $1,000.00. 
f. ?Damage to nonconforming signs. If a nonconforming sign is destroyed by natural causes or 
manmade damage (i.e. vehicle crash), it shall not thereafter be repaired, reconstructed, or replaced 
except in conformity with Article L Signs. The remnants of the former sign structure shall be removed 
and cleared from the land on which it is located. For purposes of determining damage to a 
nonconforming sign, it is considered "destroyed" if damaged to an extent that the cost of repairing 
the sign to its former condition or replacing it with an equivalent sign equals or exceeds the value 
(tax value if listed for tax purposes) of the sign so damaged. If there is no tax value then such sign 
shall be considered destroyed if the cost to replace the sign exceeds $1,000.00. 
g. ?Changing message of nonconforming signs. The message or copy on a nonconforming sign may be 
changed so long as such change does not create a new nonconformity. If there is a change of use or 
occupancy of the structure for which the sign is advertising, then the sign shall be brought into 
conformity with Article L Signs. 
h. ?Discontinuation of a business. If a nonconforming sign(s), other than a billboard, advertises a 
business service, commodity, accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no 
longer operating or being offered or conducted, such sign shall be considered abandoned and shall 
be removed within 90 days after such abandonment by the sign owner, owner(s) of the property 
where the sign is located, or other person having control over such sign. For purposes of the Land 
Development Ordinance, an abandoned sign shall be considered a nonconforming sign. 
i. ?Nonconforming billboards. 
(1) ?Existing billboards. Any billboards existing when the Sign regulations were originally adopted 
(March 5, 1990 and subsequent amendments) that are nonconforming based on those sign 
regulations are still declared nonconforming, and with the effective date of the Land 
Development Ordinance (December 30, 2016), it is not the intention to repeal but rather to 
reenact and continue to enforce without interruption of the existing sign provisions, so that all 
rights and liabilities that have occurred thereafter are reserved and may be enforced. 
(2) ?Inactive billboard. Where a nonconforming billboard remains blank or not in service for a 
continuous period of 180 days, such billboard shall be deemed abandoned and shall be 
removed within 60 days after such abandonment by the sign owner(s), owner of the property 
where the sign is located, or other person(s) having control over such sign in accordance with 
the following conditions: 
A. ?Advertises a business or commodity. It advertises a business, service, commodity, 
accommodation, attraction or other enterprise or activity that is no longer operating or 
being offered or conducted. 
B. ?Advertising message becomes illegible. The advertising message it displays becomes 
illegible in whole or substantially part. 
C. ?Advertising copy or message removed. The advertising copy or message paid for by a 
party other than the sign owner or promoting an interest other than the rental of the sign 
has been removed. 
(3) ?North Carolina State legislation. Where current or future North Carolina legislation regulates 
outdoor billboard advertising and reviews and approves permits for such signage through the 
State of North Carolina or an agency of the State, the Town of Fuquay-Varina recognizes such 
legislation overrides local codes and ordinances. However, where no valid permit approved by 
the State or its agency exists for a site containing a billboard advertisement and structure, the 
standards herein shall apply and shall be enforced. Notwithstanding such legislation, the Town 
of Fuquay-Varina will consider any outdoor billboard advertising that does not meet the 
standards of the Land Development Ordinance, specifically Article L Signs; the Town of 
Fuquay-Varina considers outdoor billboard advertising nonconforming by the Land 
Development Ordinance standards even though they may be unenforceable. 
j. ?Amortization of nonconforming signs. 
(1) ?Determination of nonconforming signs. Subject to the other sections of this article, a 
nonconforming sign is a sign that exceeds any of the standards of Article L Signs as provided 
below, including but not limited to structure, size and material of a sign. 
A. ?Maximum size. The square footage or height of the sign exceeds the maximum limitation 
of the Land Development Ordinance by more than ten percent of that permitted. 
B. ?Sign height. A pole mounted sign greater than 15 feet in height or a ground mounted sign 
greater than eight feet in height. 
C. ?Attached signs. An attached sign extending above the eave of the roofline, a sign on a roof 
or size of the sign. 
D. ?Setback. Freestanding signs that do not meet the setback standard from the back of curb 
or edge pavement for a sign greater than 42 inches in height. 
E. ?Temporary signs. Temporary signs that do not meet the size, setback, location or duration 
permitted by Article L Signs. 
F. ?Digital signs. Digital signs that do not meet the standard sign square footage permitted. 
(2) ?Time period for amortization. 
A. ?Amortization of permanent signs. Subject to other regulations in this article, a 
nonconforming sign that exceeds the limits herein identified under the section shall, within 
ten years from [date], be altered or changed to comply with the provisions of the Land 
Development Ordinance, or shall be removed. 
B. ?Amortization of temporary & banner signs. Subject to other applicable regulations in this 
article, a temporary sign or banner that exceeds the applicable requirements in accordance 
with Article L Signs shall, within two months (60 days) of December 30, 2016, be altered or 
changed to comply with the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance, or shall be 
removed from the property where the sign is located. Banner signs shall only be used as 
temporary signs, in accordance with Article L Signs. Nothing in this section shall prohibit 
future use of amortized temporary or banner signs, in compliance with Article L Signs. 
(3) ?Excessive signage for use or property. If a use or property has a nonconformity related to the 
number of signs, as a result of adoption of the Land Development Ordinance, the owner of the 
nonconforming use or property shall, within two months (60 days) of adoption of the Land 
Development Ordinance, determine which sign(s) need to be altered or removed to provide 
compliance. The owner(s) of such property or use shall coordinate with the Town regarding 
applicability of amortization of all other signs related to such use or property, in compliance with 
this section. This section shall not apply to temporary signs. 


§ 9-1508. - Nonconforming uses with specific conditions. 
There are certain uses that have an impact on the Town and therefore are specifically regulated by 
certain conditions and criteria in the Land Development Ordinance, and as such could become 
nonconforming as a result of all or some of the conditions and criteria. Therefore, the following standards 
shall apply: 
a. ?Existing use. Any legally established, existing sexually oriented business, tattoo and body 
piercing establishment, electronic sweepstakes gaming operation, palm reader, massage 
establishment or nightclub that fails to comply with the conditions and criteria of the Land 
Development Ordinance upon the effective date, December 30, 2016, shall not be deemed to 
be in violation of the Land Development Ordinance. 
b. ?New uses affecting conformity. A sexually oriented business; tattoo and body piercing 
establishment; electronic sweepstakes gaming operation; palm reader; massage establishment; 
or nightclub operating lawfully and meeting the conditions and criteria at the effective date of the 
Land Development Ordinance (December 30, 2016) shall not be rendered in violation of or 
made nonconforming by the Land Development Ordinance due to the location and/or addition of 
uses that normally would prohibit these uses from being located where they are currently 
established. 
c. ?Discontinued use. If a nonconforming sexually oriented business; tattoo and body piercing 
establishment; electronic sweepstakes gaming operation; palm reader; massage establishment; 
or nightclub is discontinued for a period of 60 days, then the property, lot or parcel of land shall 
only be occupied with a conforming use. If the nonconforming use is discontinued but re-
established within the same 60 days, then the nonconforming use may continue, provided that 
the nature and degree of the nonconformity will not be changed, enlarged or altered from that 
which existed before the nonconforming use was discontinued.

offers signage for businesses, services and the development environment, and in the same 
manner providing a positive appearance for the Town and its citizens. One of the important 
aspects of signage and its influence on the community for business and development is 
maintaining signs in a good state of repair for safety primarily, but also for appearance that 
speaks to the interest and importance of the image that the Town and its citizens want

shall incorporate and continue all thoroughfares, collector or streets stubbed to the boundary of 
the subdivision or development planned or installed by a previously approved, but un-built 
development or existing subdivision or development. 
b. ?Thoroughfares & pedestrian classifications. 
(1) ?Community Transportation Plan. The Community Transportation Plan identifies the 
classification of thoroughfares and streets that are consistent with the uniform street system 
recognized by the North Carolina Department of Transportation and the Capital Area 
Metropolitan Planning Organization (CAMPO), which is responsible for the transportation 
system within the metropolitan planning organization (MPO) designated by the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHA), including the Town of Fuquay-Varina. 
(2) ?Community Pedestrian Master Plan. The Community Pedestrian Master Plan identifies the 
location and types of pedestrian travel and access required to interface with the Community 
Transportation Plan in the Town's corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction. 
(3) ?Thoroughfare classifications. The classifications for thoroughfares, streets, alleys and the like 
are defined in accordance with Article S Interpretations & Definitions, and are listed from highest 
traffic capacity to the lowest as follows: 
A. ?Freeway, Type 11. Multi-lane 300+ feet ROW/controlled access. 
B. ?Expressway, Type 10. Multi-lane 150+ feet ROW/controlled to limited access. 
C. ?Boulevard/parkway, Type 9. Multi-lane 100120 feet ROW/limited access.

B. ?Standard six-foot sidewalk when located at the back of curb without a grass median. 
C. ?Minimum seven-foot sidewalk as identified in the Town Center Plan (DC-1 & DC-2) and 
the Varina Streetscape Plan. 
D. ?Off-road ten-foot multi-use greenway trail. 
E. ?Eight- to ten-foot side path adjacent to a thoroughfare or street. 
c. ?Intersection separation. Different classifications of thoroughfares are designed to address different 
carrying capacities for vehicles. The vehicle carrying capacity, posted speed limit and location of 
intersections have an impact on the flow of traffic and congestion. Therefore, the Town of Fuquay-
Varina requires separation between intersections based on the classification of thoroughfares in this 
article and in accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details. 
d. ?Traffic impact analysis. Development may have direct and/or indirect impact to transportation and as 
such shall be addressed during the process of plan review for a subdivision or site plan for 
residential or nonresidential development. The Town shall require a traffic impact analysis (TIA) for a 
development that meets the threshold for such analysis, based on the standards and parameters 
prescribed in accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details. 
e. ?Access management plan. An access management plan may be required based on the type and 
impact of a proposed development. This plan will address the process and design for identifying and 
managing access to thoroughfares from public roads and private driveways for land proposed for 
development. Standards may include but are not limited to restrictions on the type, number and 
location of access points to a thoroughfare, a minimum separation between access points, and use 
of physical controls such as signals, channelization and raised medians. Such a plan, in association 
with a traffic impact analysis, is intended to preserve the general flow of traffic in terms of safety, 
capacity and speed. 
f. ?Thoroughfare density credits. Thoroughfare density credits may be applied where a parcel of land is 
impacted by the dedication or reservation of right-of-way in accordance with this article and the 
adopted Community Transportation Plan in accordance with Article Q Procedures & Administration, 
section 9-1808, gg. Thoroughfare Density Credits.

( Ord. No. PZ-17-01 , § 8(Att. D), 4-3-2017; Ord. No PZ-18-02 , § 4(Att. E), 3-5-2018) 


§ 9-1653. - Off-street parking standards. 
Parking is an integral element for economic growth and frequently is the predominant and visual entrance 
to a development or site. The plan and design standards for a parking lot are intended to address 
appearance and mobility without compromising vehicle and pedestrian safety. The Town of Fuquay-
Varina's parking and design standards are the minimum required to address safety and appearance 
where parking is located. These standards emphasize the placement and design of parking areas, traffic 
movement design, ingress and egress, landscaping and buffers, lighting and pedestrian access and 
safety. 
a. ?Parking location. Off-street parking shall be located in the side yard or rear yard of the principal 
building, except that parking may be permitted in the front yard area of the principal building 
which shall not exceed an area greater than 65 feet in depth between the edge of the required 
street landscaping along the front property line and walkway in front of the principal building. 
Proposed off-street parking with a total of 50 parking bays or less shall be exempt from this 
standard. 
(1) ?Shopping center exemption. Shopping centers are exempt from the standard of 
subsection a. above because of the size and integration of multiple buildings and uses; 
however, all other standards in this section shall apply. 
b. ?Design elements within the parking area. Proposed off-street parking areas shall be arranged 
and designed using landscape islands, landscape medians, plazas, courtyards, walkways 
and/or buildings. These elements used in the design and arrangement of off-street parking are 
intended to create safe movements for pedestrians and vehicles through, to and from the 
parking lot area(s) to the building(s) or use(s) on the zoning lot or parcel. Landscape medians, 
landscape islands, perimeter landscaping and screening shall be provided in accordance with 
Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection Standards. 
c. ?Wheel-stops or protection devices required. Where adjacent to a buffer, sidewalk or property 
line, wheel-stops shall be provided and located a minimum of three feet from the edge of such 
buffer, sidewalk or property line to avoid vehicle encroachment into such buffer, sidewalk or 
property line. When no wheel-stop is provided, the edge of pavement or curb and gutter shall be 
provided a minimum of five feet from the edge of such buffer or property line, or shall sidewalk 
shall be provided with a minimum of four clearance. All measurements herein shall be provided 
assuming a 2½-foot overhang of vehicles. Other suitable protection devices may be approved 
by the Town. 
d. ?Nonresidential use of off-street parking. Off-street parking areas shall be used solely for the 
purpose of parking licensed motor vehicles in operating condition based on the following 
criteria: 
(1) ?Nonresidential customer parking. Customer parking to patronize a business, retailer, 
office, service or use utilizing the off-street parking area for such business, retailer, office, 
service or use is permitted. 
(2) ?Nonresidential employee parking. Employee parking to provide for the operation of the 
business, service or establishment is permitted. 
(3) ?Guest parking. Guest parking shall be designated within the parking areas and shall be 
distributed equally throughout a proposed development where required. 
(4) ?Additional usage. Parking for additional usage may be provided in compliance with the 
Land Development Ordinance and this article. 
e. ?Residential use of off-street parking. The Town of Fuquay-Varina requires off-street parking for 
residential uses, except as otherwise may be provided in the Land Development Ordinance, to 
minimize the amount of on-street parking and maintain safe travel lanes for the general public. 
However, it is also the purpose of the Town to provide parking for each individual residential lot 
that provides convenient parking, but also maintains the appearance and character of each 
individual lot. For these reasons the Town requires that individual lots follow specific standards 
for parking. 
(1) ?Surface material. Vehicular surface area shall be specifically designed and installed with a 
vehicular surface treatment utilizing porous or semi-porous monolithic or paver materials, 
masonry or concrete pavers, poured concrete or asphalt, or constructed with a minimum 
depth of four inches of aggregate base course (ABC) stone (crush & run). 
(2) ?Parking outside the vehicular surface area. Except for circular and semi-circular drives, 
vehicular surface areas located within the front or side yard area of a single-family 
detached dwelling shall not be located in front of the dwelling's primary entrance. No 
vehicle shall be parked or stored outside of the vehicular surface treatment area, within a 
front or side yard area, excepted as otherwise addressed in the Land Development 
Ordinance. 
(3) ?Parking in front yard prohibited. Parking vehicles in the front yard of a residence, whether 
an existing or new residence, shall be prohibited, except in designated driveway or parking 
area in accordance with the provisions provided herein. 
(4) ?Model home or sales center. A residential, single-family home used as model home or 
sales center shall provide a paved parking area, including a minimum of two parking bays, 
with direct ADA compliant access from the parking area to the entrance of the model home 
or sales center. The access driveway width shall comply with the residential driveway width 
standard of the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details. Such parking area 
may be provided on the adjacent lot, where such lot is in the same ownership or a 
notarized right to use has been received by the Town. 
f. ?Off-street parking & storage of vehicles, trailers or manufactured homes. Off-street parking or 
storage of delivery or service vehicles, trailers or manufactured homes shall be prohibited within 
the front or side setback of a principal building/use, or a minimum of 50 feet from a public right-
of-way, whichever is greater, adjacent to a public thoroughfare, except as otherwise permitted in 
the Land Development Ordinance. 
g. ?Prohibited use of off-street parking. 
(1) ?Signage. Any display for advertising using signs, banners or information promoting a 
business using off-street parking of vehicles and/or trailers shall be prohibited, except in 
accordance with Article L Signs. 
(2) ?Sales. Off-street parking bays shall not be permitted for the display or parking of vehicles 
for sale, trucks and/or trailer, goods or produce for sale, or leasing, rental or long-term 
storage, except as otherwise permitted in the Land Development Ordinance. Where 
permitted in the Land Development Ordinance, such display shall only take place when 
located in approved off-street parking bays beyond the minimum required. 


§ 9-1654. - Access to off-street parking areas. 
All off-street parking areas shall have direct access to a right-of-way in accordance with this section. 
a. ?Minimum width. Off-street parking areas that are not connected to a right-of-way shall provide 
an access driveway not less than 24 feet in width to accommodate two-way traffic connecting to 
a right-of-way. The access driveway shall be paved in the same manner required for the off-
street parking area. 
b. ?Access. Driveways to access off-street parking may cross perpendicularly through buffer and 
landscape areas, connecting thoroughfares and adjacent existing or proposed off-street 
parking, in accordance with an approved subdivision plat or site plan. 
c. ?Exiting parking areas. All parking shall be designed such that the required access to the right(s)-
of-way shall be by forward motion of a vehicle exiting a nonresidential, multi-family and mixed-
use parking lot or facility, except for a single-family detached residence, a duplex, triplex, 
townhouse or as approved by the Town Board of Commissioners provided that the applicant 
demonstrates that the exiting of vehicles will not create a safety hazard. 
d. ?Turnaround area. If a service driveway or street is longer than 150 feet or does not continue to a 
second outlet a turnaround shall be provided, as required by the Fuquay-Varina Fire 
Department and/or the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details. 
e. ?Connection to residential zoning districts. An access drive for nonresidential uses shall not 
connect to property in a residential zoning district unless the proposed driveway provides 
access to a parking area serving a use permitted in a residential zoning district. 
( Ord. No. PZ-17-01 , § 8, 4-3-2017) 


§ 9-1655. - Shared & cross-access requirements. 
Shared access between properties and/or uses is a priority for the Town to provide safe vehicle ingress 
and egress movement and to minimize the number of ingress and egress access points onto a public 
street, and maximize the cross-access easements between properties and/or uses. To promote and 
utilize the use of shared access [for] a development or project, the following process must be provided: 
a. ?Shared access analysis. 
(1) ?Analysis determined during site plan & review. With the submittal of a site plan design, the 
applicant of the project or development shall have analyzed the design to determine and 
accommodate shared cross-access on and between adjacent properties and/or uses. 
(2) ?Types of cross-access. The analysis performed may be in the form of joint driveways, a 
public street or private access easement to adjacent properties. 
(3) ?Existing property conditions. Shared cross-access shall be integrated into the proposed 
site plan or development plan if conditions, such as, but not limited to, topography, property 
configuration, environmental constraints and the proposed use(s), are compatible for the 
use(s) to share cross-access. 
b. ?Private cross-access easement & agreement. 
(1) ?Cross-access for vehicles & pedestrians. Private cross-access easements may be 
required as part of a site plan or development plan submittal to address access between 
adjacent properties of like uses and/or zoning to permit integrated vehicular and/or 
pedestrian movement between such properties. 
(2) ?Cross-access agreement. The owner of the property under review as a site plan shall 
execute a cross-access easement and agreement by which the property owner will accept 
vehicular traffic, agree to join maintenance, and the cross-access agreement shall be in 
perpetuity with the property. The cross-access easement and agreement shall be recorded 
as part of the site plan or development plan prior to the site plan or development plan being 
approved. 
(3) ?Adjacent property cross-access agreement. Where a property is proposed for 
development adjacent to a an existing developed property with an executed and recorded 
cross-access easement agreement, the owner of the adjacent proposed development shall 
also execute a cross-access easement and agreement to accept vehicular and/or 
pedestrian movement between the two adjacent properties. 
(4) ?Cross-access design. In the design of a site plan or development plan, such plan shall 
include the construction of a driveway within the cross-access easement to accommodate 
two-way traffic and shall be constructed abutting the rear or side property line to 
accommodate the cross-access to the adjacent property line(s). 
(5) ?Physical conditions. The design and location of a cross-access easement shall take into 
consideration topography, property configuration and environmental constraints so that a 
reasonable and acceptable location and connection point can be provided between 
adjacent properties. 
(6) ?Multiple lots plan. Where a site plan or development plan is designed with multiple lots, 
the plan shall include a cross-access easement and agreement between all approved lots 
by the Town. 


§ 9-1656. - Vehicle stacking area. 
Minimum vehicle stacking standards shall apply where a drive-through is utilized or where required 
herein, unless otherwise provided by the Land Development Ordinance or approved by the Planning 
Director. 
a. ?Minimum size. Each stacking bay shall be a minimum of eight feet wide by 20 feet long. 
b. ?Location & number. Stacking bays [shall] be provided in the number required herein, and shall 
not impede or interfere with movements into or out of off-street parking bays, traffic movement, 
and may require raised medians to separate stacking bays from the off-street parking bays.

§ 9-1657. - Shared parking standards. 
a. ?Approval of shared parking. The Planning Director or his/her designee may approve shared parking 
facilities for developments or uses with different operating hours or different peak business periods if 
the shared parking complies with all of the following standards: 
(1) ?Location. Shared parking bays shall be located within 600 feet of the primary entrance of all 
uses utilizing the same parking area, unless a remote parking shuttle bus service is provided. 
(2) ?Zoning classification. Shared parking areas require the same or a higher intensity zoning 
classification as the property where the principal uses are located. 
(3) ?Shared parking. Developments requesting to use shared parking as a means of satisfying the 
off-street parking requirements shall submit to the Planning Director, with a site plan, the 
proposed shared parking based on the Table  Parking Occupancy Rates in this article. 
(4) ?Off-street parking table & parking occupancy rate table. Based on the minimum parking 
required and the proposed uses, the shared parking permitted shall be determined according to 
section 1652 General Standards, Table  Parking Standards and section 1657 Shared Parking 
Standards, Table  Parking Occupancy Rate of this article. 
b. ?Shared parking permitted. To determine the amount of shared parking permitted, the following 
process shall apply: 
(1) ?Identifying uses. Identify all uses proposed for the development and that they have equal 
access to all parking bays on the same site as the principal uses. 
(2) ?Instruments for cross-access. Cross-access easements on the principal property or adjacent 
properties are executed and recorded, and verify that there are no environmental or legal 
impediments to permit shared parking. 
(3) ?Determine Minimum Parking Required. The parking required shall be determined by calculating 
the minimum parking required for each use proposed in accordance with the Table  Parking 
Standards in this article. 
(4) ?Performing Calculation. The information provided to the Planning Director or his/her designee 
shall be reviewed and then applied to an excel spreadsheet that will perform the calculation to 
determine the reduced shared parking as the minimum parking required for the proposed 
development. The following table shall be used to evaluate and determine the reduction of 
parking permitted:

Density (RHD) Zoning Districts, except where guest parking is required by this article. 


§ 9-1661. - Off-site parking standards. 
a. ?Approval of off-site parking. If the minimum off-street parking required by this article for a specific use 
cannot be reasonably met on the same lot on which the principal use is located, the Planning 
Director or his/her designee may approve a location on a separate lot from the lot on which the 
principal use(s) is located if the off-site parking is in accordance with the following standards and 
other provisions of this article: 
(1) ?Location. The parking provided on a separate lot shall be within 500 feet from the property line 
containing the principal use(s) the off-site parking is serving. The off-site parking shall be 
approved as part of a site plan for the principal use(s). 
(2) ?Ownership. The lot upon which the off-site parking is proposed and located shall be in the 
same ownership as the lot where the principal use(s) is located. If there is a different lot owner 
where the off-site parking is located, a written leasehold interest agreement, valid for a minimum 
of five years, shall be executed as part of the approval of a site plan. If the leasehold interest 
expires or is terminated, then sufficient off-street parking, as required by this article and other 
regulations in the Land Development Ordinance, shall be provided on the lot of the principal 
use(s), or a new leasehold interest instrument shall be acquired meeting the requirements of 
this article and receive site plan approval by the Town of Fuquay-Varina for off-site parking. The 
leasehold agreement shall be in the following form and authorized in the following manner: 
A. ?Attested leasehold interest agreement. An attested copy of the leasehold interest 
agreement between the owners of record, of the off-site parking and the site where the 
principal use is located, shall be submitted to the Planning Director or his/her designee for 
recordation in a form and substance established by the Town Attorney.

the issuance of a Certificate of Zoning Compliance for any use(s) to be served by the off-
site parking area. 
C. ?90-day notice. The leasehold interest agreement shall include a provision that notifies the 
Planning Director at least 90 days prior to the termination of such leasehold interest 
agreement for off-site parking. 
D. ?Revoking a leasehold interest agreement. An off-site parking leasehold interest agreement 
may be revoked only if all required off-street parking is provided on the lot of the principal 
use(s) in accordance with this article. 
b. ?Provisions for off-site parking. Provisions for off-site parking shall be provided based on a distance 
from the principal use property to the off-site parking location as follows: 
(1) ?Maximum distance. Where the remote off-site parking is greater than 500 feet from the 
property line of the lot on which the principal use (s) is located, a shuttle bus service or similar 
service shall be provided that would be operated during the hours of operation of the principal 
use(s). 
(2) ?Rights-of-way 80 feet or greater. Off-site parking shall not be separated from the lot which 
contains the principal use(s) by a street right-of-way greater than 80 feet in width, unless a 
grade separated pedestrian walkway is provided, or other traffic control or remote parking 
shuttle service is utilized. 
(3) ?Zoning classification. The lot upon which the off-site parking is located shall be required to 
have the same nonresidential zoning or a more intense nonresidential zoning than required for 
the lot where the principal use(s) is located. 
c. ?Off-site parking in residential districts prohibited. Off-site parking for nonresidential uses in any 
residential district is prohibited, except as otherwise provided in the Land Development Ordinance. 
d. ?Failure to comply. Failure to comply with these provisions of this article shall constitute the principal 
use(s) as a nonconforming use(s) and will be subject to the conditions and requirements as 
regulated for nonconforming uses in the Land Development Ordinance. 


§ 9-1662. - Compliance with ADA & North Carolina State Building Code. 
A portion of the total number of off-street parking bays required for each off-street parking area shall be 
specifically identified, designated, located and reserved for use by persons with physical disabilities as 
regulated by the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the North Carolina State Building Code 
regulations. 
a. ?Number of accessible parking bays required. The minimum number of accessible parking bays 
to be provided for the physically disabled shall be computed in fulfilling the total off-street 
parking requirement. The following table determines the ratio of accessible parking bays 
required, based on the number of parking bays provided unless otherwise required by the North

§ 9-1664. - Parking lot lighting. 
The Town of Fuquay-Varina considers parking lot lighting an important element that enhances public 
safety and welfare for its citizens. As such, the Town requires that certain standards apply to all parking 
lots, driveways and entrances to such parking lots to provide safe movement for vehicles and pedestrian 
traffic, and avoid common parking lot lighting practices that produce unsightly and dangerous glare, the 
unnecessary waste of energy resources and the unintended illumination of property adjacent to a parking 
lot facility. The following standards shall apply to all public and private parking lots within the Town's 
corporate limits and its extraterritorial jurisdiction: 
a. ?General parking lot lighting criteria. 
(1) ?Uniform lighting. Parking lot lighting shall be designed to provide for uniform lighting, in 
accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details, throughout the 
parking facility with no dark patches or pockets. 
(2) ?Minimize lighting on adjacent property. Parking lot lighting shall not cause direct 
illumination onto adjacent and nearby properties or thoroughfares. If the maximum foot-
candle cannot be maintained in accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications & 
Construction Details, shields shall be provided on the fixtures to prevent glare and the 
maximum foot-candle requirement. 
(3) ?Light fixture type. All lighting fixtures within a parking lot shall be full cutoff fixtures as 
defined by the Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA). 
(4) ?Light fixture design. Light fixtures may be mounted as a single, double or four-fixture 
arrangement, except that only a single light fixture mounting shall be permitted within 50 
feet of an adjacent property line zone as a residential district. 
(5) ?Pole height. The maximum pole height is 30 feet measured from the finished grade to the 
top of the fixture. 
(6) ?Lighting, poles & pedestals location. Light poles and pedestals adjacent to pedestrian 
walkways, parking lot travel ways, curb and gutter and parking bays shall be located a 
minimum of two feet from the edge of the aforementioned elements within or adjacent to 
the parking lot area. Where light poles and pedestals are located adjacent to parking bays 
the parking bay(s) shall include wheel stops adjacent to the poles or pedestals. 
(7) ?Light pole & landscape island tree coordination. The location of light poles and fixtures 
shall not conflict with required landscape islands which contain a required tree. The 
relationship of parking lot lighting and landscape islands must be part of the analysis and 
proposal with the site plan or development plan submittal for review. 
b. ?Conformance with applicable standards. All parking lot lighting shall be installed in conformance 
with the Land Development Ordinance, the applicable standards of this article and the Town's 
Standard Specifications & Construction Details. 
c. ?Alternative architectural fixture style. If the design of an area suggests or dictates the use of 
parking lot lighting fixtures of a particular period or architectural style, the Planning Director may 
permit alternatives or supplements to the lighting fixtures and poles described in the criteria 
herein provided that: 
(1) ?Maximum lumens. If the fixtures are not full "cut-off" as defined by IESNA, the maximum 
lumens generated by each fixture shall not exceed 2,000. 
(2) ?Maximum height. Mounting heights of such alternative luminaires shall not exceed 18 feet 
above finished grade. 
(3) ?Preapproval. All such fixtures of a period or architectural style shall be approved by the 
Planning Director or his/her designee as a part of the subdivision, site plan or development 
plan review. 
(4) ?Maintenance. The developer/property owner shall be responsible for the maintenance of 
all designer/ornamental architectural poles and fixtures and the cost of power for each 
fixture, until such time that the homeowners association (HOA) is established and 
responsibility is transferred from the developer/property owner. The Town of Fuquay-
Varina shall be responsible for the cost for power for light fixtures that meet the lighting 
standards of the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details.

§ 9-1710. - Perimeter buffer yards. 
The Town of Fuquay-Varina considers perimeter buffer yards as a necessary component of any 
development within the Town's corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction for the purpose of 
compatibility between different use intensities and comfort and enjoyment for individual property owners. 
Perimeter buffer yard standards are designed to provide a vegetative transition between developments; 
mitigating negative impacts to adjacent land uses; preserving open space and existing vegetation where 
possible, and supplementing with new plantings where necessary to obtain the minimum standard buffer; 
and to prevent or minimize grading changes between adjacent properties to permit adequate buffered 
areas to remain. 
a. ?General perimeter buffer yard standards. 
(1) ?Location & arrangement of buffers. The buffers required in this article shall be located 
along the outer perimeter of a lot or parcel of land and shall run parallel with property lines, 
except where a thoroughfare buffer is required, in which case such buffer shall be utilized 
along the related thoroughfare, and meeting the following standards: 
A. ?Buffer composition. A buffer shall not include any portion of an existing or proposed 
public right-of-way, private street or public or private easement except as otherwise 
permitted in this article. 
B. ?Buffer planting. The plant material contained in the required buffer shall be planted 
across the entire width of the buffer (not just along the edge of the buffer) planted in 
staggered rows or a landscape design pattern. 
C. ?Buffers between adjacent uses. Buffers shall be required between adjacent 
nonresidential properties except those located in the Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) 
District, Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) District, Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) District, 
Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) District and Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) District. 
(2) ?Berms, walls & fences. Berms, walls and fences (chain link is prohibited) may be 
incorporated into the landscape design, but shall not take the place of the required 
landscape plant materials. A fence or wall may be permitted in a perimeter buffer in 
compliance with Article G Lot & Structure Provisions, and where required, landscape plant 
material shall be located on both the interior and exterior side of the fence or wall. A 
minimum of 50 percent of the required landscape plant material shall be located along the 
top half of a berm and the remaining plant material may be on the sides and toe of the 
berm, unless otherwise provided by the Land Development Ordinance. 
(3) ?Preserve environmental areas. Where a perimeter buffer yard is required in a location that 
includes identified wetlands, riparian buffers or floodplain, no planting of landscaping 
material shall be required in these specific areas. 
(4) ?Development within required perimeter buffer yard. No land disturbing activities (grading 
or development) or the removal of existing vegetation shall be permitted within a required 
perimeter buffer yard that does not function or meet the intent or standards of this article. 
The exception for the establishment and maintenance of such required perimeter buffer 
yard for an approved site plan, subdivision plan or phased development plan may apply to 
the following: 
A. ?Disturbance of buffer. Disturbance within the required perimeter landscaping buffer 
due to damage to existing vegetation shall be minimal to the extent practicable and 
supplemental planting shall be installed as necessary to meet the perimeter buffer 
required. 
B. ?Utilities. Public or private utilities are permitted in accordance with this article where 
no reasonable alternative location can be determined. 
C. ?Stormwater regulations. Stormwater management areas or BMPs provided there is no 
reasonable alternative location can be determined. 
(5) ?Root zone encroachment. If the critical root zone (drip line) of any tree or other landscape 
material encroaches up to one-third or more onto an adjacent lot or parcel of land, the site 
under development shall protect the root zone in order to protect the health and livability of 
the tree or plant material. 
(6) ?Perimeter buffer yard ownership. No required perimeter buffer yard within a residential 
subdivision shall be wholly or partly owned (fee simple title) by the owner of an individual 
residential lot within such subdivision in accordance with the following standards: 
A. ?Homeowners association or third party. The perimeter buffer yard shall be owned by a 
homeowners association or owned by a third party for perpetual maintenance, such 
that the landscape material is protected from removal, modification or damage. 
B. ?Perimeter buffer separate from lot. A perimeter buffer yard required as part of a 
residential subdivision requirement shall not be part of a lot or used to calculate the 
minimum lot size requirement. The residential subdivision perimeter buffer yard shall 
be a separate parcel of land and under separate ownership from the residential 
subdivision lot owner, except under the following condition: 
i. ?Perimeter buffer under lot control. A required perimeter buffer yard may be 
permitted to be under the control of a residential subdivision lot owner provided 
that:

§ 9-1712. - Thoroughfare buffers & street landscaping. 
Street trees and landscaping are an important element of the appearance, visual introduction to the 
Town, and a statement by the Town of its interest and desire to incorporate a vista of trees and 
landscaping as part of the developed environment of the Town. Therefore, the Town has identified 
thoroughfares and corresponding landscape buffer requirements or transition areas between the 
thoroughfare and the developed portion of a lot or parcel of land. 
a. ?Thoroughfare classifications. The thoroughfare classifications shall be used to determine the 
standards for thoroughfare buffers and landscaping: 
(1) ?Thoroughfare buffers & landscaping. Developments along thoroughfares (freeway, 
expressway, boulevards, parkway, major and minor thoroughfares, and thoroughfare 
collectors) shall provide a minimum size and amount of landscape buffering, including 
street trees, using undisturbed vegetation and/or new landscaping, in accordance with the 
following standards: 
A. ?Residential development. Residential development including single-family and multi-
family shall provide a minimum buffer width and density of landscaping, as required in 
section 9-1714, Table  Landscaping & Screening of this article along the property 
line adjacent to a thoroughfare. The thoroughfare buffer shall not be included as part 
of individual lots, except where the covenants for a proposed residential subdivision 
shall include language outlined in this section. 
B. ?Nonresidential development. All nonresidential development shall provide a minimum 
buffer width and density of landscaping, as required in section 9-1714, Table  
Landscaping & Screening of this Article along the property line adjacent to the 
thoroughfare. The covenants or restrictions for a proposed nonresidential 
development shall include language outlined in this section. 
(2) ?Residential collector. Residential collectors serve a single-family residential development, 
where street trees are required, and where the species required shall be a large shade 
tree. The covenants for a proposed residential subdivision shall include language outlined 
in this section. 
(3) ?Street or local street. These are streets and local streets, normally 50 foot right-of-way, 
with internal ingress and egress for residential subdivisions, lots or nonresidential 
development. Street trees are required along these type thoroughfares, as provided in 
section 9-1714, Table  Landscaping, Buffers & Screening, along the property line 
adjacent to the thoroughfare. The restrictive covenants, whether through a homeowners 
association or maintenance agreement for nonresidential development, or where no 
association or maintenance agreement exists the property owner/developer shall specify 
and determine the instrument for the responsibility of maintenance of the street trees in 
perpetuity as outlined in this section. If a homeowners association is subsequently formed 
such association shall have the ultimate responsibility to maintain the street trees. 
(4) ?Covenants to enforce buffers & street trees. Any thoroughfare buffers or street trees 
required in accordance with this article, and the Land Development Ordinance in general, 
shall establish through covenants and restrictions and/or a homeowners association the 
responsibility to enforce the maintenance and/or replacement of the required buffer and/or 
street tree(s). If a homeowners association is established then the homeowners 
association shall have the ultimate responsibility to maintain and/or replace a required 
buffer or street trees, or require the lot owner to perform the maintenance and 
replacements. The covenants shall include language for the homeowners association to 
perform the maintenance and/or replacement of the buffer or street tree if the lot owner 
fails to perform such maintenance and/or replacement. If a buffer is part of an individual lot 
or a street tree is located in front of the subdivision lot, and a homeowners association is 
not formed, the covenants will specifically address that it is the responsibility of the lot 
owner to maintain the buffer and/or street tree, whether located on the private lot or in a 
public right-of-way, in perpetuity. 
b. ?Disturbance of street trees & buffers. Disturbance of a required buffer type is permitted under 
the following conditions: 
(1) ?Public streets. Public streets constructed perpendicular to the width of the buffer may be 
permitted where such construction is necessary for safe and reasonable ingress or egress 
to property. The location and size of the public street shall be identified on the site plan or 
preliminary subdivision plat or phased development plan at the time of review by the Town 
and in accordance with the Town's Standard Specifications & Construction Details. 
(2) ?Public utilities. Notwithstanding any other restrictions or provisions herein the Town of 
Fuquay-Varina shall be permitted to obtain public utility easements and perform 
construction of public utilities parallel or otherwise through or within the buffer and within 
such easements as required or necessary. The public utility easement may count towards 
the buffer requirement. 
(3) ?Driveways. Driveways may cross a buffer for nonresidential, multi-family and mixed-use 
developments based on approved plans by the Town and/or the North Carolina 
Department of Transportation, and in accordance with this article. Residential driveways for 
a subdivision are prohibited from crossing a buffer, except as approved on a preliminary 
subdivision plat. An exception may be considered by the Planning Department as part of a 
site plan or preliminary subdivision plat review and approval. There shall be extenuating 
circumstances that will prohibit the ability to obtain reasonable and safe ingress and egress 
to a public right-of-way as follows: 
A. ?Existing development. The lot or parcel of land is isolated from other properties to 
obtain access because of existing surrounding development. 
B. ?Environmental constraints. The lot or parcel of land is isolated because of 
environmental constraints that would prevent alternative access. 
C. ?Larger subdivision plat. The lot or parcel of land is not part of a larger subdivision plat. 
c. ?Utility equipment landscaping. Equipment for private utilities located at grade level and greater 
than three feet in height shall be screened where visible from the public right-of-way. Such 
screening shall include small evergreen shrubs meeting the standards of this article, spaced no 
greater than two.

any source of actual or constructive notice of the decision within which to file an 
appeal. It shall be conclusively presumed that all persons with standing to appeal 
have constructive notice of the decision from the date on which a sign containing the 
words "Zoning Decision" or "Subdivision Decision" or "Administrative Decision" in 
letters at least six inches in height and identifying the means to contact an official for 
information about the decision is promptly posted on the property that is the subject of 
the decision, provided the sign remains on the property for at least ten days. Posting 
of signs is not the only form of constructive notice. Any such postings shall be the

Director (Zoning and Subdivision Administrator) or other administrative staff certifies 
to the Board of Adjustment, after notice of appeal has been filed, that because of the 
facts stated in an affidavit, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property or 
because the violation is transitory in nature, a stay would seriously interfere with 
enforcement of the Land Development Ordinance. In that case, enforcement 
proceedings shall be stayed except by a restraining order, which may be granted by a 
court. If enforcement proceedings are not stayed, the appellant may file with the 
official a request for an expedited hearing of the appeal, and the Board of Adjustment 
shall meet to hear the appeal within 15 days after such a request is filed. 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, appeals of decisions granting a permit or otherwise 
affirming that a proposed use of property is consistent with the Land Development 
Ordinance shall not stay the further review of an application for permits or permissions 
to use such property. In these situations the appellant may request, and the Board of

Board of Adjustment shall continue the hearing. The Board of Adjustment may reverse 
or affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the decision appealed from and shall make 
any order, requirement, decision or determination that ought to be made. The Board 
of Adjustment shall have all the powers of the official who made the decision.

B. ?The hardship results from conditions that are peculiar to the property such as location, 
size or topography. Hardships resulting from personal circumstances, as well as

Ordinance. The procedures and administration processes herein are designed to provide clear 
instructions on applications required, staff reviews, approvals required, schedules and submittal 
requirements. Any person interested in information about development review procedures and 
administration requirements must make sure that the latest amendments are identified in the Land 
Development Ordinance. 


§ 9-1801. - Common review & procedures. 
There are a number of steps in the review process that apply to all applications for a proposed 
development under the regulations of the Land Development Ordinance. 
a. ?Authority to file application. Applications for reviews and approvals in accordance with the Land 
Development Ordinance shall be submitted to the Planning Department by a property owner, 
developer, authorized agent or any other person having a recognized interest in the 
development of land within the corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction of the Town of 
Fuquay-Varina. Applications may also be submitted to the Town of Fuquay-Varina for 
annexation and services for property within the urban service area (USA) granted by Wake 
County. The urban service area remains within the jurisdiction of Wake County; however, the 
Town of Fuquay-Varina has the responsibility to provide public utilities and annexation if the 
property owner or proposed development wishes to connect to a public utility within the urban 
service area. For purposes of the Land Development Ordinance, development includes 
applications for zoning, text amendment, subdivisions, site plans, construction, grading, utilities, 
signs, buildings, appeals, special use permits, variances, inspections and any other activity 
regarding the use or reuse of property. 
b. ?Applicant. The applicant may be the owner, agent or person with standing for the property 
proposed for development. If the applicant is an authorized agent, or there is more than one 
applicant or a person of standing, the following requirements shall apply: 
(1) ?Applicant other than owner. If an authorized agent, contract purchaser or a person of 
standing in a property other than the owner, the application must include a letter signed by 
the property owner, notarized and attested, consenting to the submission of the 
application, or if the application specifically includes a signature page for the property 
owner to sign, in either case the application is not complete without such signature(s). 
(2) ?Multiple owners. If the applicant is not the sole owner of the property to be developed, a 
letter signed by all other owners, or an association representing the owners consenting to 
or joining in the application for development approval, which all shall be notarized and 
attested, and shall be submitted with the application. 
c. ?Application submission schedule. The schedule for the submission of applications shall be 
established by the Planning Director or his/her designee and shall be made available to the 
public annually. 
d. ?Simultaneous application processing. Where two or more applications are required for review 
and approval in accordance with the Land Development Ordinance (e.g. annexation and 
zoning), such applications for development approval may be, at the option of the Planning 
Director, processed simultaneously, except where such review and approval would conflict with 
applicable State and local requirements to satisfy multiple applications. However, where the 
Land Development Ordinance requires two types of reviews for the same approval (e.g. master 
plan and a preliminary subdivision plat), such reviews and approvals shall be completed as 
separate processes as required in the Land Development Ordinance. 
e. ?Application form & information. Applications required under this article shall be submitted on a 
form with attached documentation as required, which is established by the Planning Director 
and made available to the public. 
f. ?Application fees. The Town Board of Commissioners shall determine all fees required annually 
to accompany all applications submitted under the Land Development Ordinance. The Town 
Board may adjust fee amounts from time to time. The purpose of the fee amount is to defray the 
actual cost of processing an application, administration of such application and legal advertising 
where required by law. Application fees shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(1) ?Fee required. No application shall be processed until the application fee has been paid, 
except as otherwise directed by the Planning Director. 
(2) ?Refunds. Application fees are not refundable except where the Planning Director 
determines that an application was accepted in error, or the fee paid exceeded the amount 
due, in which case the amount of the overpayment will be refunded to the applicant, or in 
certain types of application is withdrawn prior to legal advertising. 
g. ?Pre-development meeting. A pre-development meeting is encouraged prior to submission of any 
application for development under the Land Development Ordinance. (The purpose of the pre-
development meeting is to provide assistance with the process for review and approval, 
schedules, fees, water and sewer plans and capacities, stormwater management, to familiarize 
the applicant with the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance that will apply and Town 
staff that will be involved with the proposed development.) Such meeting may be initiated as 
follows: 
(1) ?Initiation of pre-development meeting. Any potential applicant, property owner developer 
or citizen may request a predevelopment meeting by contacting the Planning Department 
staff, which schedules such meetings. The person requesting the meeting must give a 
description of the character; location and type of the proposed development, and any other 
information that would help Planning staff determine the appropriate Town staff to be in 
attendance. 
(2) ?Meeting. At the pre-development meeting, the applicant, Town staff and other local, 
County, State or Federal representatives shall discuss the scope, features and potential 
impacts of the proposed development, approval processes, review steps and schedules 
that the applicant shall follow. 
h. ?Pre-submittal meeting. A pre-submittal meeting is required for preliminary major subdivision 
plats, site plans, multi-family projects, thoroughfare improvements, utility extensions and 
building construction or renovation. Before the application and plans are submitted to the Town, 
the applicant shall schedule a pre-submittal meeting with a sketch plan or layout of the 
proposed project. The purpose of this pre-submittal meeting is to offer assistance by the Town 
staff on a proposed development to address any issues, details, expectations and general 
review comments to help expedite and address fewer questions and comments that may arise 
during the formal staff review of the proposed development. 
i. ?Application submission. An application for development shall be submitted to the Planning 
Department pursuant to the application submittal schedule, if required, established by the 
Planning Director and made available to the public along with a fee schedule adopted by the 
Town Board of Commissioners. The application submitted must be complete with all required 
materials and documentation as identified on the application form. The Planning Director or 
his/her designee shall determine if the application is sufficiently complete and has the data and 
sufficient detail to proceed with processing the application. 
(1) ?Application deadlines. Applications for certain types of approvals have required deadlines 
to submit an application, which are scheduled annually by the Planning Department. The 
deadlines for zonings and text amendments are normally the first Friday of each month 
unless otherwise scheduled by the Planning Department according to the annual submittal 
schedule. Late submittals may be permitted; however, such submittal shall not be more 
than two days past the original deadline (not including weekends or holidays) with an 
increased application fee in accordance with the annually adopted fee schedule. 
(2) ?Approval schedule. When an application for zoning is submitted on the first Friday of a 
month the zoning application shall be scheduled before the Planning Board at their 
regularly scheduled meeting of the following month. The Planning Board shall make a 
recommendation concerning the proposed zoning that will be scheduled before the Town 
Board of Commissioners at the first regularly scheduled meeting of the following month. 
The exception to this schedule is if the Planning Board and/or Town Board of 
Commissioners table the zoning application for further study or information. 
(3) ?Determination of sufficiency. An application shall be considered sufficient when the 
application is fully completed, proper signatures and contact information are provided, all 
documentation, plans and other ancillary applications associated with the proposed 
development provided, fees paid and the application is submitted by the schedule 
deadline, if required. 
(4) ?Determination & review for compliance. After an application is determined sufficient, it 
shall be reviewed pursuant to the procedures and standards as outlined in this article. 
(5) ?Staff review. Upon determination of compliance, the planning staff shall proceed with 
reviews as follows: 
A. ?Application & plans distributed. The application and associated plans and 
documentation shall be processed and distributed to the appropriate Town staff for 
review and comments. 
B. ?Review schedule. A schedule will be established by the Planning Director for the 
review of plans and assembling comments and submitting them to the applicant. The 
review schedule is based on work days only and does not include weekends or 
holidays. With the exception of zoning cases, text amendments and annexation 
petitions, each review shall require a minimum of 21 days for staff to complete the 
review and assemble comments. The Planning Department serves as the 
clearinghouse for all reviews and comments. The review process is as follows: 
i. ?First review. Town staff shall review plans and determine if the plans are in full 
compliance with the Land Development Ordinance. Comments are prepared and 
e-mailed to the applicant. 
ii. ?Subsequent review(s). Town staff shall review revised plans and determine if the 
plans are in full compliance. If there are still issues to be resolved, or comments 
that were not addressed adequately, additional comments will be prepared and 
e-mailed to the applicant. The Planning Director may determine that it is 
necessary to have a meeting with the applicant to resolve specific issues or 
comments. If after the second review and/or a meeting with the staff there are 
still issues to be resolved, the Town shall require a fee to continue the review in 
accordance with the Fee Schedule adopted by the Town Board of 
Commissioners. 
iii. ?Response by applicant. For each individual review cycle the applicant shall 
revise the development plans based on comments provided by the Town and 
resubmit the development plans within 90 days of the date the applicant receives 
the written comments by e-mail or in other written form. If such deadline is not 
met, the application shall be considered withdrawn from the review process, 
except that the Planning Director may approve a one-time extension up to 60 
days based on the circumstances and substantial reasons for not meeting the 
required deadline. 
iv. ?Preliminary major subdivision plats. Preliminary major subdivision plats do not 
have a specific deadline to submit an application. However, the review of such 
application for a preliminary major subdivision plats shall be completed and 
deemed in compliance with the provisions of the Land Development Ordinance 
prior to being scheduled to appear before the Planning Board. 
(6) ?Approval or recommendation. The final decision and/or approval of an application for a 
development plan shall fall under two categories as follows: 
A. ?Staff approval. If an application is subject to staff review and final approval, the 
applicant shall receive a decision to approve, approve with conditions or denial of the 
application. Upon completing the review process, staff shall render an approval within 
ten working days, except where the application requires additional time or approvals 
before Planning staff may render such approval. 
B. ?Staff recommendations. If an application is subject to staff review and 
recommendation to the Planning Board or Town Board of Commissioners, the 
Planning Department shall prepare a written staff report that explains the request and 
compliance of such application. For the Board of Adjustment staff will prepare a 
report; however, as a quasi-judicial board the applicant and interested parties must 
present evidence for the Board of Adjustment to determine action on a case. The time 
to review such applications and render a decision shall be subject to the provisions of 
the Land Development Ordinance and the General Statutes of the State of North 
Carolina. 


§ 9-1802. - Public hearing. 
Where an application for development approval requires a public hearing the Planning Director or his/her 
designee shall ensure that a public hearing(s) is scheduled for the application before the decision-making 
and/or advisory board reviewing the application. A public hearing is scheduled based on a pre-determined 
schedule to accommodate sufficient time for staff review and recommendation, and to meet public 
notification requirements in accordance with G.S. 160A-384 and other statutes as required. 
a. ?Public notification & advertising. All notices for a public hearing required by the North Carolina 
General Statutes shall include the information required as well as any additional information 
deemed necessary by the Town of Fuquay-Varina. The Planning Director or his/her designee 
shall be responsible for preparing the content of the notice.

such application. 
B. ?Alternative form of notification. The provisions outlined in G.S. 160A-384(b) may be

B. ?Posting setback. The posted sign shall be set back no greater than 25 feet from a 
public street(s) so that the lettering is visible to the public. 
C. ?Time of posting. A sign(s) shall be posted no less than ten days prior to the date of 
the public hearing and at the same time that a notice is mailed or legal notice 
published. 
D. ?Multiple properties. Where land is subject to an application that is more than one

addresses to all members of the decision-making board shall not disqualify any member of the 
board from voting. 


§ 9-1804. - Planning Board review & recommendation. 
After the submission of an application requiring Planning Board review and recommendation, Planning 
staff shall review such application and associated plans to ensure that such plans meet the standards of

prepare a staff report and schedule a public hearing, if required, on the application and associated plans. 
At the public hearing, the Planning Board shall consider the application, the relevant support materials 
and plans, the staff report and public comment given. After the public hearing has been closed, the 
Planning Board shall consider all materials and testimony presented, and shall make a recommendation 
to the Town Board of Commissioners either to approve, recommend conditions (if a conditional zoning or 
text amendment) or disapprove the application, and forward such recommendation and application to the 
Town Board of Commissioners for final action. 
a. ?Written report. In accordance with G.S. 160A-387, all proposed amendments to the Land 
Development Ordinance or the official zoning map shall have a written report provided from the 
Planning Board to the Town Board of Commissioners within 35 days of a recommendation 
approved for referral of an amendment to the Town Board of Commissioners. If not provided, 
the Town Board of Commissioners may proceed in its consideration of the amendment without 
a Planning Board report. Furthermore, in no case shall the Town Board of Commissioners be 
bound by the recommendation(s), if any, by the Planning Board. 
b. ?Consistency statement. In accordance with G.S. 160A-383, the Planning Board shall advise and 
comment on whether the proposed zoning amendment is consistent or inconsistent with all 
applicable official adopted plans serving as a comprehensive plan and provide a written 
recommendation to the Town Board of Commissioners that addresses the consistency or 
inconsistency with such plans and other matters as deemed appropriate by the Planning Board. 


§ 9-1805. - Town Board of Commissioners review & action. 
Upon receiving a recommendation from the Planning Board, the staff report and recommendation, or at 
the discretion of the Town Board of Commissioners after 35 days of consideration of a proposed 
amendment to the Land Development Ordinance or official zoning map by the Planning Board with no 
written recommendation received, the Town Board of Commissioners shall conduct a public hearing on 
an application. At the public hearing, the Town Board of the Commissioners shall consider the 
application, the relevant support materials, the staff report, the Planning Board recommendation, and 
public comment given at the public hearing. Upon closing the public hearing, the Town Board of 
Commissioners, by a majority vote of the quorum present, shall approve, approve with conditions (if a 
conditional zoning or text amendment) or disapprove the application based on the relevant material 
presented. 
a. ?Decision notification. Upon a decision by the Town Board of Commissioners, notification of such 
decision on an application shall be provided by the Planning Director or his/her designee to the

normal business hours. 


§ 9-1806. - Application withdrawal. 
A request for withdrawal of an application shall be submitted in writing to the Planning Director or his/her 
designee. 
a. ?Prior to notice of public hearing. The Planning Director may approve a request to withdraw an 
application if it has been submitted and the notification of a public hearing has not yet been 
advertised pursuant to this article. 
b. ?Subsequent to notice of public hearing. Once notice of a public hearing has occurred pursuant 
to this article, the request for withdrawal of an application shall be placed on the agenda and 
acted upon by the appropriate decision-making body. 
c. ?New petition. After a petition is withdrawn, a new petition, without prejudice, may be submitted 
for consideration following the standard schedule and procedures in accordance with this 
article. 


§ 9-1807. - Successive applications. 
When an application is disapproved, a subsequent application for all or part of the same request shall 
only be considered in accordance with this article. 
a. ?Zoning map amendment. A zoning map amendment application that is disapproved shall not be 
considered for a period of one year from the date of the disapproval. The maximum number of 
times the same property may be considered for a zoning map amendment during a one-year 
period is two times per year in accordance with the following standards: 
(1) ?Change of ownership. If the ownership of the property has changed, the new owner shall 
have the ability to petition for a zoning map amendment during the same one-year period. 
(2) ?Material differences. The subsequent application involves an application that is materially 
different from the prior application. 
(3) ?Insufficient material. The decision-making body that made the final decision on the 
application determines that the prior disapproval was based on mistaken facts or 
insufficient material, by a simple majority of the membership. The decision-making board 
charged with conducting the public hearing under such successive application shall resolve 
any issue concerning the similarity of a successive application or other issues that may 
develop related to such application. 
b. ?Special use permit. A subsequent application that is materially different from the prior 
application may be submitted without limitation. The Board of Adjustment charged with 
conducting the public hearing under such successive application shall resolve any issue 
concerning the similarity of a successive application or other issues that may develop related to 
such application. 
c. ?Text amendment. There shall be no limitation on the number of times a text amendment may be 
considered, with a required recommendation by the Planning Board and final action by the 
Town Board of Commissioners. 


§ 9-1808. - Common application procedures. 
The development review procedures described in this article are those through which the majority of all 
development proposals must be reviewed and approved before a proposed development can be 
constructed, occupied, or otherwise used. 
a. ?Administrative adjustment. Within the Land Development Ordinance there are provisions to 
allow the Town Manager or his/her designee to provide administrative adjustments in certain 
cases without requiring approval by a decision-making body. An administrative adjustment is 
designed to allow such adjustment based on general requirements in this article and specific 
criteria, as identified in other Articles within the Land Development Ordinance, which the Town 
Manager or his/her designee shall review to determine if such an adjustment is justified. 
(1) ?Submit request. The property owner/developer shall submit a written request with 
associated documentation addressing the conditions under which the Town Manager or 
his/her designee may review and consider such adjustment. There are general and specific 
standards that shall be considered as follows: 
A. ?General required findings for administrative adjustments. The general findings 
required for each administrative adjustment shall be clearly demonstrated by the 
person(s) applying for the requested adjustment as follows: 
i. ?Maintains purpose & intent. The administrative adjustment maintains the purpose 
and intent of the approved use or regulation for which the adjustment is 
requested, as outlined in the Land Development Ordinance. 
ii. ?Maintains the design, convenience & character. The administrative adjustment 
shall be in harmony with the approved use, will maintain the design, convenience 
and character of the use, and such adjustment will be compatible with the 
surrounding land uses. 
iii. ?Identified constraints. The administrative adjustment is based on definitive 
constraints, associated specifically with the proposed adjustment. 
iv. ?Documentation of constraints. If the proposed adjustment directly or indirectly 
relates to specific constraints, the applicant shall provide documentation by a 
qualified professional regarding such specific constraints. 
B. ?Specific required findings for administrative adjustments. In addition to the general 
requirements, certain administrative adjustments are permitted with specific 
requirements within the Land Development Ordinance, including but not limited to: 
i. ?Mixed-use development ratio. See Article F Use Regulations, section 9-1255, l. 
Development Projects, (2) Mixed-Use Development, D. Mixed-Use Development 
Standards, xvii. Administrative Adjustment for an adjustment to the minimum 
percentage ratio between residential and nonresidential uses. 
ii. ?Minimum required parking. See Article N Parking, Loading & Lighting Design 
Standards, section 9-1658 Alternative Off-Street Parking, a. Criteria for 
Consideration of Alternative Off-Street Parking and b. Administrative Adjustment 
for the reduction of minimum parking requirements. 
iii. ?Retention of existing plant material. See Article O Landscaping & Tree Protection 
Standards, section 9-1706 Installation & Inspection, b. Inspection, (1) Prior to 
certificate of occupancy. 
iv. ?DC-1 & DC-2 Form-Based Zoning District Standards. See Appendix A DC-1 & 
DC-2 Form-Based Districts, section 9-2005 Administrative Adjustment. 
(2) ?Review & comments. The Town Manager or his/her designee shall review the request 
based on its own merit. A determination shall be made if the request is justified. The Town 
Manager or his/her designee shall provide a written approval with or without conditions, or 
the request is denied with a written response as to why the request was denied. 
(3) ?Appeal. Any appeal of the Town Manager or his/her designee's decision shall follow the 
procedures as outlined in this article to the Board of Adjustment. 
b. ?Amendments. The Land Development Ordinance is designed and implemented to anticipate 
and accommodate a variety of development forms that will provide sustainability for economic 
growth, healthy living, environmental sensitivity and diversity in services, jobs and affordability. 
However, cases and trends will occur where the Land Development Ordinance regulations and 
standards did not anticipate or accommodate some other forms or aspects of development that 
could further meet the goals and objectives of the adopted plans and ordinances of the Town. 
At such times it is appropriate to consider whether amendments, based on the Land of 
Development Ordinance, should be considered and amended. 
(1) ?General standards. In determining whether to adopt or disapprove a proposed zoning 
amendment to the official zoning map or a text amendment to the Land Development 
Ordinance, the Town Board of Commissioners shall, after due consideration and 
recommendation by the Planning Board, generally consider one or more the following 
factors: 
A. ?Changing conditions. To what extent have conditions changed to consider an 
amendment such as but not limited to changing trends in development types, growth 
trends, infrastructure changes and adopted plans.

measures by such amendment are implemented to provide compatibility through 
additional measures that are reasonable and reduce the impact to existing uses. 
C. ?Impact on the natural environment. To what extent the proposed amendment will 
result in significant impacts on the natural environment, including, but not committed

D. ?Types of zoning map amendments. There are four types of zoning map amendments: 
i. ?Standard zoning. This process involves the property owner requesting to change 
the existing property's zoning to a different zoning permitted in the Land 
Development and Ordinance. The Planning Board shall make a recommendation 
to the Town Board of Commissioners regarding a proposed zoning district 
change. The standard zoning allows any use that is permitted by right within the 
proposed zoning district, and therefore discussion on proposed uses or a 
particular use or activity is prohibited on such property for rezoning. Otherwise, 
such information would be considered "contract zoning," which is illegal under 
State law. As part of the application, maps shall be submitted with, at a minimum, 
the following information, but not limited to: 
1. ?All property lines with metes and bounds, north arrow, scale and title of the 
map. 
2. ?Adjoining street names and rights-of-way. 
3. ?The location and use of existing structures, if applicable. 
4. ?The present zoning and proposed zoning with acreage. 
5. ?The existing zoning of all adjacent properties to the proposed zoning. 
ii. ?Conditional zoning. A conditional zoning is a legislative process and decision, and 
subject to judicial review, using the same procedures and administration as the 
general use zoning district. However, conditional zoning applies to a proposal by 
a property owner/developer in which the development and/or use of property is 
subject to the predetermined ordinance standards applicable to the 
corresponding general use district as well as additional rules, regulations, and 
conditions that are imposed by the applicant as part of the legislative decision 
creating the conditional zoning. In no case shall application of zoning conditions 
supersede regulations within the general use zoning district nor be less restrictive 
than regulations within the general us zoning district. Conditional zoning petitions 
shall comply with the following: 
1. ?Planning Board review. The Planning Board shall review a conditional 
zoning application, conduct a required public hearing and make a 
recommendation on the proposed conditional zoning and proposed 
conditions to the Town Board of the Commissioners. 
2. ?Town Board review. In consideration of an application for a conditional 
zoning, the Town Board of Commissioners shall conduct the required public 
hearings and make a decision in accordance with the procedures and 
administration of this article. 
3. ?Map information. Maps shall be submitted with the information as identified 
above under subsection D. Types of Zoning Map Amendments. 
4. ?Conditions. Conditional zoning permits the establishment of conditions 
based on site-specific standards proposed by the applicant. Conditions may 
include, but not be limited to, buffers and screening of adjacent property 
uses, limiting the number and/or permitted uses by right on the property, 
location of ingress and egress access, arrangement of site lighting, 
mitigating noise and dust. In consideration of an application for conditional 
zoning, the Town Board of Commissioners may request, with concurrence 
by the applicant, to agree on additional reasonable and appropriate 
conditions being attached to the conditional zoning application. The 
applicant shall have a reasonable opportunity to consider and respond to 
any such conditions proposed by the Town Board of Commissioners prior to 
a final action on the application. 
5. ?Mutually agreed conditions. Specific conditions applicable to a proposed 
conditional zoning must be mutually agreed to between the applicant and 
the Town Board of Commissioners. 
6. ?Consistency. The Town Board of Commissioners shall adopt a statement 
describing whether its action is consistent or inconsistent with the Land Use 
Plan and an explanation why the Town Board of Commissioners considers 
the action taken to be reasonable and in the public interest. 
7. ?Effect of approval. Upon approval of a conditional zoning, it shall subject the 
property to be governed by the pre-determined requirements, conditions and 
site-specific standards, all of which shall constitute the zoning regulation for 
such approved district and are binding on the property as an amendment to 
the district regulations and to the official zoning map. 
8. ?Compliance. If an application for a conditional zoning is approved, the 
applicant shall comply with all standards and conditions approved to obtain 
a building permit and/or certificate of occupancy. In addition, the Planning 
Department shall update the official zoning map by identifying the approved 
conditional zoning with the designation of "CZD" (conditional zoning district) 
with the general use district applied to the conditional zoning application. 
9. ?Amendments to conditional zoning. Approval of a conditional zoning and the 
conditions imposed upon such approval shall be perpetually binding on the 
land unless it is subsequently amended. Amendments to an approved 
application for conditional zoning shall be treated in the same manner and 
follow the same procedures as the original application to create the 
conditional zoning. 
iii. ?Planned Unit Development District. A Planned Unit Development Zoning District 
is a floating zoning district that affords the property owner/developer to develop a 
comprehensive development plan, called a master plan, which lays out the 
infrastructure (roads and utilities); types of development; pedestrian and 
recreation components and protection of environmental areas; architectural 
designs and materials standards; landscaped standards; unified sign standards; 
and covenants that support approval of a Planned Unit Development Zoning 
District. The criteria for a planned unit development shall be in accordance with 
Appendix D Planned Unit Development of the Land Development Ordinance. 
iv. ?Form-based zoning districts. Form-based zoning districts are floating zoning 
districts that allow the opportunity for a property owner/developer to use 
development regulations through a master plan that provides predictable built 
results and a quality public realm (the area between building façades and public 
use space). The focus is not on the use but instead the form through architectural 
standards, landscaped standards, civic spaces and public standards. The criteria 
for a form-based district zoning plan shall be in accordance with Appendix B 
RMU, NMU & UMU Form-Based Districts of the Land Development Ordinance. 
v. ?Town Center Residential Districts. A Town Center Residential District is a floating 
zoning district that affords the property owner/developer to develop a

Zoning District. The criteria for a Town Center Residential District shall be in 
accordance with Appendix C Town Center Residential District of the Land 
Development Ordinance.

c. ?Annexation. Annexation is the process for the Town of Fuquay-Varina to expand its corporate 
boundaries in accordance with G.S. 160A-29, which sets out the procedures and administration 
for annexations whether initiated by the municipality or initiated by a property owner who 
voluntarily submits an application for annexation. 
(1) ?Voluntary annexation. The owner(s) of property requesting annexation shall submit a 
signed application requesting annexation to the Town of Fuquay-Varina Planning 
Department. Such annexation petition may be submitted at any time. The following criteria 
shall be part of the voluntary annexation procedure: 
A. ?Annexations within the Town's jurisdiction. Property proposed for development 
located within the Town's extraterritorial jurisdiction, and that is requesting public 
services or if public services are available within a certain distance of the property 
proposed for development in accordance with Article M Thoroughfare, the Drainage & 
Utility Standards, section 9-1615 Public Utilities shall submit a voluntary annexation 
application in conjunction with a proposed development. 
B. ?Annexations outside Town's jurisdiction. Property proposed for development which is 
located outside the Town's corporate limits and extraterritorial jurisdiction, but is within 
the Town's urban service area, and is requesting public services shall submit a 
voluntary annexation application and a zoning application prior to submitting any other 
applications for such development. 
C. ?Voluntary annexation without certain services. There are instances where a voluntary 
annexation application is submitted; however, a service(s) may not be reasonably 
available to the property at the time of annexation. In such cases the owner(s) of the 
property requesting for voluntary annexation shall execute a declaration of annexation 
agreement whereby the owner(s) agrees not to receive such service(s) that cannot 
reasonably be provided at the time of annexation. Such declaration of annexation 
agreement document shall be part of the voluntary annexation application. 
D. ?Determination of utility service availability. The Town's utility line is located such that 
only a service tap is required. If the location of the Town utility line requires an 
extension of such utility line, the property owner requesting the utility service will be 
responsible for the cost of such extension. The Public Utilities Department will provide 
a general estimate of the cost to extend the utility line and provide the estimate to the 
property owner to evaluate and determine if the property owner desires to move 
forward with receiving the utility service.

cost of a meter(s) and the cost for boring under a street if the utility service is on 
the opposite side of the street from the property requesting the service tap(s). 
ii. ?Utility account. The property owner shall set up a utility account for water and/or 
sewer with the Town's Water Department. This process is completed after the 
fees have been paid and annexation of the property has been approved. Where 
extenuating circumstances may exist, the property owner may request to the 
Public Utilities Director and the Town Manager the ability to obtain a service tap 
prior to the Town Board of Commissioners approving the annexation application. 
F. ?Sewer without water. It is the practice of the Town that a property owner requesting a 
service tap to public sewer shall also connect to public water except in extenuating 
circumstances that must be reviewed and determined is reasonable for public health 
and safety by the Public Utilities Director and the Town Manager.

supply watershed overlay district, where applied. 
B. ?Private utility system. Density credits may be applied to the same parcel of land

number of residential units permitted under the existing residential zoning district on the 
parcel of land in question, except for the thoroughfare dedication or reservation. The 
number of residential units permitted associated with the thoroughfare dedication may then 
be applied to the remaining parcel of land proposed for development; however, the total 
density for the proposed development shall not exceed the maximum density permitted per

Appendix A - DC-1 & DC-2 Form-Based Districts 


§ 9-2000. - Purpose. 
The Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) and Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning Districts are created to 
encourage development and a greater downtown presence by focusing on land use, density, architectural 
continuity and its heritage and a prime destination within the community of Fuquay-Varina. The goals for 
the Downtown Center-1 and Downtown Center-2 Zoning Districts are to: 
a. ?Public realm. Create a special public realm that invites pedestrian use and encourages social 
interaction. 
b. ?Architectural integrity. Build on the existing architectural assets and historic precedents to 
encourage a more authentic downtown. 
c. ?Pedestrian linkage. Drawing the Town Center Plan together through pedestrian linkages and 
appropriately designed infill development. 
d. ?Eliminate building gaps. Close the building gaps along the primary retail streets to promote a 
continuous, active building face on the primary streets. 
e. ?Safe downtown. Encourage a safe downtown by adequately accommodating vehicles while also 
respecting the pedestrian need for safety and free movement. 
f. ?Mix of retail & residential. Promote and encourage a mix of economically viable retail, mixed-use 
development and office uses in the downtown districts. 


§ 9-2001. - Intent. 
To achieve the desired outcome of a sustainable and progressive downtown there are basic strategies 
important to the success of the downtowns future. These strategies include a development format called 
form-based development which addresses "building form" (what buildings look like, materials, color, 
height and how large), "building sitting" (where buildings are positioned relative to the streets and 
sidewalks, and where parking is located), "pedestrian space" (civic space, pedestrian walkways, outdoor 
dining, safe street crossings and parking areas), and "residential living" (promote and implement 
residential living in downtown through mixed-use developments, live/work units, perimeter residential and 
easy access to downtown). 


§ 9-2002. - Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District. 
The DC-1 Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District is designed to be the "downtown primary retail 
district" for the Town of Fuquay-Varina. There are two primary retail districts: the Fuquay Primary Retail 
District and the Varina Primary Retail District. 
a. ?Density. There is no maximum residential density in the Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning 
District. 
b. ?Building placement. The following standards shall apply to the building placement within the 
Downtown Center-1 Zoning District: 
(1) ?Build-to-line. Each parcel shall be assigned a primary frontage, to be approved by the 
Town. Parcels on a corner shall also have a secondary frontage except where a parcel 
adjoins two primary streets, and then said parcel shall have two primary frontages. The 
build-to-line shall be no closer than 12 feet from the back of curb; no closer than two feet to 
the frontage line (right-of-way line); no greater than ten feet from the frontage line (see 
Figure DC-1-1); and the following shall apply: 
A. ?Adjacent buildings. If adjacent lots have buildings which establish a frontage line 
within the front ten feet of the parcel, the build-to-line for the subject parcel shall 
match that existing build-to-line, where practical. 
B. ?Landmark properties. Where landmark properties, as defined or recognized by the 
Town, adjoin either side of the property, the build-to-line shall be located no closer to 
the frontage line (front property line) than the midpoint of the distance between the 
frontage of the existing landmark building and the front property line. Furthermore, 
where an existing landmark structure adjoins both sides of the subject parcel, the 
build-to-line shall be no closer to the street than the frontage of the existing adjoining 
landmark building which sits closest to the street. 
 
Figure DC-1-1
C. ?Build-to-line applicability : The build-to-line shall apply for a minimum of 75 percent of 
the primary frontage and a minimum of 50 percent of the secondary frontage (see 
Figure DC-1-2). 
 
Figure DC-1-2
D. ?Utility easements. Where existing or required utility easements or other fixed 
constraints preclude achieving the 75 percent or 50 percent thresholds, the build-to-
line shall apply to the maximum extent practical. 
E. ?Building not meeting build-to-line thresholds. Proposed buildings which are not large 
enough to accomplish fulfillment of the build-to-line thresholds, whether due to 
phasing or not, shall achieve a streetwall effect by means of a wall, fencing or other 
Town approved means to a minimum six-foot height for that portion of the build-to-line 
threshold requirement not fulfilled by the proposed building (see Figure DC-1-3). 
 
Figure DC-1-3
c. ?Building setbacks. Building setbacks are as required in the table below. The build-to-line criteria 
shall take precedence over the following setback criteria (see Figure DC-1-4).

nonresidential uses. 
(2) ?Residential minimum parking. For parcels with more than five residential units, 1.25 off-
street parking bays per unit shall be required. (For example: 5 units or less = 0 parking 
spaces; 6 units = 6 × 1.25 = 7.5, rounded up to the next whole number = 8 parking 
spaces.) 
(3) ?Off-site parking. Up to 100 percent of the required number of spaces may be provided off-
site if access to those spaces is documented through easements, long-term rental 
agreement or as otherwise permitted in Article N Parking, Loading & Lighting Design 
Standards, section 9-1652 General Standards and section 9-1657 Shared Parking 
Standards.

(1) ?Required sidewalk width. For all new parcels, new building development, or 
redevelopment, except for properties designated as Historic or Landmarks, a minimum 
seven-foot-wide sidewalk is required along all primary streets and a minimum five-foot-
wide sidewalk is required along all secondary streets. Such standards are subject to 
obtaining required encroachment permits and easements from the Town and/or the North 
Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT), within a public right-of-way. 
(2) ?Exception. Where the minimum required sidewalk width would result in less than two feet 
in width between the sidewalk edge and the back of curb, the sidewalk shall be continuous 
to the back of curb with the additional width added to the minimum sidewalk width. 
(3) ?Minimum width. In no case shall a sidewalk be less than five feet in width. 
(4) ?Streetscape master plans. The Town's streetscape master plans shall apply to all new 
development and redevelopment within the Downtown Center (DC-1) Zoning District. The 
master plans include the Fuquay Streetscape Plan and the Varina Streetscape Plan, 
including, but not limited to, sidewalk design, street trees, planters, access and pedestrian 
crossings. 
p. ?Ground floor uses. For buildings facing primary streets, the ground floor shall have only 
nonresidential uses, as permitted in Article F Use Regulations; only lobbies and other similar 
incidental uses for residential uses will be permitted on the ground floor. Buildings on secondary 
streets may have any use, as permitted in Article F Use Regulations, on the ground floor. 
q. ?Articulation. The following architectural elements of a building façade shall be applied as 
follows: 
(1) ?Primary façades. Architectural details which are expressed through the articulation of 
building materials have historic precedents in Fuquay-Varina and the Piedmont region. A 
minimum of two of the following articulations, or Town approved equivalent alternative 
elements, shall be required on all primary façades as follows: 
A. ?Projected lintels in masonry, precast concrete or stone. 
B. ?Projected and/or recessed horizontal brick detailing. 
C. ?Projected horizontal cornice at or below the termination of a roof parapet. 
D. ?A minimum 18-inch overhanging roof eave at a pitched roof. 
E. ?A minimum eight inches in height continuous horizontal projection or expression line 
of brick, precast concrete or stone between floor levels, or as a coping for a parapet 
wall. 
F. ?Vertical masonry pilasters extending a minimum of two floors and projected from the 
building façade face a minimum of six inches. 
r. ?Ground floor façades & windows. Individualized shop fronts and business fronts in the 
Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District contribute to a positive pedestrian experience. This 
is especially true when these façades are transparent enough to provide a significant visual 
connection between inside and outside the building. To address this connection the following 
standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Transparency. Ground floor façades are required to be transparent for no less than 60 
percent of the horizontal length of the building façade, with clear, nontinted glass, or with 
glass tinted no more than 20 percent, between the heights of three feet and eight feet 
above the public sidewalk. 
(2) ?Glass panel size. Ground floor glass panels are limited to a maximum of four feet wide by 
six feet high and shall be separated by a minimum four-inch mullion or post. 
(3) ?Solid base. A solid base constructed of wood, stone, brick or architectural concrete no 
less than two feet high is required between the store front glass and the sidewalk. 
Architectural variation, either a solid base or transparent glass, shall account for the one 
foot difference between this requirement and subsection (1) above. 
(4) ?Security. Security gates, bars and doors, including roll-down and horizontal doors, 
whether exterior or interior, are prohibited on all doors and windows facing the public street 
frontages. 
(5) ?Bay windows. Shop fronts may project a maximum of two feet into the public sidewalk as 
"bay windows." 
s. ?Building materials. The intent of this standard is for building materials to be long-lasting, of 
natural materials, and reflect the building traditions of the Piedmont region. Common building 
materials between adjacent buildings are essential for a visually coherent downtown. The 
following standards shall be required for new building construction and reconstruction of an 
existing building: 
(1) ?Minimum requirements. Brick masonry shall constitute 80 percent of primary façades and 
60 percent of secondary façades, after subtracting entrances and storefront and windows. 
The balance of the façades must be comprised of wood, stone, architectural concrete, 
synthetic soffits/cornices, or concrete siding, such as HardiPlank. Exceptions must be 
approved by the Town Board of Commissioners. The following materials are prohibited: 
A. ?Metal siding. 
B. ?Wood or concrete shake siding. 
C. ?Vinyl siding. 
D. ?EIFS (with the exception of detailed horizontal cornices). 
E. ?Split or smooth face concrete block. 
(2) ?Application. The building materials as specified in the Land Development Ordinance apply 
to nonresidential, mixed-use and multi-family development. It does not apply to one- and 
two-family dwellings in accordance with the North Carolina Residential Code for One- and 
Two-Family Dwellings. 
t. ?Roofs & rooflines. Roofs may vary from flat to sloping. Use of similar roof forms will create a 
more unified and cohesive streetscape. Roof forms and heights shall be appropriate to the 
architectural character of the building. Varying roof/parapet heights in downtown contribute to a 
visually interesting streetscape. The following standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Permitted roofs. Flat hip & gable roofs are acceptable. 
(2) ?Prohibited roof. Mansard roofs are prohibited. 
(3) ?Gable ends. Gable "ends" shall not front the street or occur on a primary façade. 
(4) ?Roof overhang. Pitched roofs must have a minimum of 18-inch overhanging eaves. 
(5) ?Roof slope. Pitched roofs must slope no less than 6:12 or more than 12:12. 
(6) ?Metal roofs. Corrugated metal roofs and wood shake roofs are prohibited except where 
these types of roofs are not visible from any point along a public right-of-way. Standing 
steam metal roofs with a 24-inch separation between the seams which are black, brown or 
grey in color shall be permitted. 
(7) ?Parapets. Parapets shall be no less than 42 inches where a flat roof is proposed. 
(8) ?Cornices. Cornices, when incorporated into the parapet design, shall project from between 
six inches and 12 inches beyond the face of the façade. 
u. ?Color. Color provides continuity from building to building while serving to enhance the visual 
character of downtown. The color palette of a building is composed of the main, trim and accent 
colors. The colors chosen for awnings, canopies, shutters and roofs also contribute to the 
overall color scheme of a building. The overall color scheme of a building or project should 
reflect a cohesive pattern. These provisions recognize that the review of a building's color 
scheme is a balance between an owner's creativity and individuality, the architectural style of 
the building, and an overall harmonious vision for downtown. The main color should be the 
predominant color of the building. The trim color is applied to architectural elements such as 
windows, doors, columns, etc. The following color standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Color palette. The selection of colors for new and existing buildings shall be determined 
from a color palette or equivalent approved by the Town Board of Commissioners and 
available in the Planning Department. 
(2) ?Color scheme. The use of a single color on all surfaces shall be prohibited. A two- or 
three-color scheme is required to provide visual appeal. 
(3) ?Trim. The trim color shall be a lighter or darker tone of the main color. 
(4) ?Accent color. In a three-color scheme, the accent color shall be used sparingly to highlight 
certain architectural elements such as a front door or awning. 
(5) ?Low reflectance. Colors shall be low reflectance. 
(6) ?Bright colors. Bright colors shall be used only as accents. Refer to the color palette 
available in the Planning Department. 
(7) ?Mortar & caulking. Mortar and caulking colors shall be compatible with the predominant 
material. 
(8) ?Color & adjacent buildings. It is not required that a building (existing or new) is the same 
color or color theme as an adjacent building or across from the public right-of-way except 
the color(s) must follow the color palette identified in this subsection or as amended from 
time to time. 
(9) ?Painting masonry. It is permitted to paint a masonry façade, but must follow the color 
palette identified in this subsection or as amended from time to time. 
(10) ?Addition to color palette. When necessary, the Town staff will submit a color palette 
and/or additional colors to the Town Board for review and approval. A request for color(s) 
not consistent with the adopted color palette may be submitted to the Town Board of 
Commissioners for consideration as an addition to the color palette. 
v. ?Building entrances & doors. Individualized entryway design elements and variations are 
encouraged to provide a positive pedestrian experience. Each building must have a clearly 
defined and highly visible entrance featuring at least one of the following architectural features: 
(1) ?Covering. Features over doors and windows include canopies, awnings or a portico. 
(2) ?Recessed entrance. Entrance and door recessed behind the building façade a minimum of 
three feet.

(6) ?Entry door material. Entry doors are required to be constructed of clad wood, steel or 
painted wood. 
x. ?Upper story balconies & porches. Upper story balconies and porches can add character and a 
distinctive atmosphere for downtown residential living creating a positive influence on social 
structure in an urban setting. Multi-family and mixed-use developments in the Downtown 
Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District are residential types that can be enhanced with the use of 
upper story balconies and porches. The following required standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Minimum clearance. Upper story balconies or porches incorporated into a multi-family, 
mixed-use or townhouse development along a primary or secondary street shall be 
installed with a minimum nine feet of clearance between the bottom of the balcony or porch 
and the surface of the sidewalk. 
(2) ?Maximum encroachment. An upper story balcony or porch shall not extend more than a 
maximum of five feet in depth from the face of the building façade, and further shall not 
cover more than three feet of the sidewalk in the public right-of-way.

building, or the requirements of this Land Development Ordinance will not conflict with the 
designation of the historic/landmark property or building. 
bb. ?Conversion of existing residential structure to another use. The conversion of an existing 
residential structure to a nonresidential use shall not constitute bringing the entire structure into 
compliance with this appendix, except where any modifications to the building either due to 
North Carolina Building Code requirements or by choice of the owner, in total, are in excess of 
50 percent of the current assessed building value as determined by the Wake County Revenue 
Department. 
cc. ?Exemption of nonconforming uses. The following provisions shall apply to uses existing as of 
August 2012, the adoption of the Downtown Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District, which are located

( Ord. No. PZ-16-13 , § 10, 12-5-2016) 


§ 9-2003. - Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District. 
The Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District is designed to be the "downtown transitional retail district" 
for the Town of Fuquay-Varina. There are two transitional retail districts: the Fuquay Transitional Retail 
District and the Varina Transitional Retail District. 
a. ?Density. The maximum residential density permitted in the Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning 
District is 22 dwelling units per acre. 
b. ?Building placement. The following standards shall apply to the building placement within the 
Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District: 
(1) ?Build-to-line. Each lot shall be assigned a primary street frontage, to be approved by the 
Town. Parcels on a corner shall also have a secondary frontage, except where a parcel 
adjoins two primary streets, in which case said parcel shall have two primary frontages. 
The build-to-line shall be no closer than 15 feet from the back of curb; no closer than two 
feet to the front frontage line (right-of-way line); no greater than 20 feet from the frontage 
line (see Figure DC-2-1); and the following shall apply: 
A. ?Adjacent buildings. If both adjacent lots have buildings that establish a frontage line 
within the front 20 feet of the parcel, the build-to-line for the subject parcel shall match 
that existing build-to-line, where practical. 
B. ?Landmark properties. Where landmark properties, as defined or recognized by the 
Town, adjoin either side of the property, the build-to-line shall be located no closer to 
the frontage line (front property line) than the midpoint of the distance between the 
frontage of the existing landmark building and the front property line. Furthermore, 
where an existing landmark building adjoins both sides of the subject parcel, the build-
to-line shall be no closer to the street than the frontage of the existing adjoining 
landmark building which sits closest to the street. 
 
Figure DC-2-1
C. ?Build-to-line applicability. The build-to-line shall apply for a minimum of 50 percent of 
the primary frontage and a minimum of 25 percent of the secondary frontage (see 
Figure DC-2-2). 
 
Figure DC-2-2
D. ?Utility easements. Where existing or required utility easements or other fixed 
constraints preclude achieving the 50 percent or 25 percent thresholds, the build-to-
line shall apply to the maximum extent practical. 
E. ?Building not meeting build-to-line thresholds. Proposed buildings which are not large 
enough to accomplish fulfillment of the build-to-line thresholds, whether due to 
phasing or not, shall achieve a streetwall effect by means of a wall, fencing or other 
Town approved means to a minimum six foot height for that portion of the build-to-line 
threshold requirement not fulfilled by the proposed building (see Figure DC-2-3). 
 
Figure DC-2-3
c. ?Building setbacks. Building setbacks are as required in the table below. The build-to-line criteria 
shall take precedence over the following setback criteria (see Figure DC-2-4).

site if access to those spaces is documented through easement, long-term rental 
agreement, or as otherwise permitted in Article N Parking, Loading & Lighting Design 
Standards, section 9-1661 Off-Site Parking Standards and section 9-1657 Shared Parking 
Standards. 
(6) ?Parallel parking. If a development proposes a new public street or the widening of an 
existing public street, parallel on-street parking must be provided on all such streets 
subject to Town Board of Commissioners approval. 
n. ?Drive-through. A drive-through is permitted in the Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District in

building development or redevelopment, except for properties designated as Historic or 
Landmarks, a minimum five-foot-wide sidewalk shall be required along all public streets, 
subject to acquiring required permits and easements from the Town and/or the North 
Carolina Department of Transportation, in a public right-of-way. 
(2) ?Exception. Where the minimum required sidewalk width would result in less than two feet 
in width between the sidewalk and the back of curb, the sidewalk shall be continuous to the 
back of curb with the additional width added to the minimum sidewalk width. 
(3) ?Streetscape master plans. The Town's Streetscape Master Plan shall apply to all new 
development and redevelopment within the Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District. 
The master plans include the Fuquay Streetscape Plan and the Varina Streetscape Plan,

crossings. 
q. ?Ground floor uses. Buildings on primary and secondary streets may have any use in the 
Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District as permitted in Article F Use Regulations on the 
ground floor and upper stories. 
r. ?Articulation. The following architectural elements of a building façade shall be applied as follows: 
(1) ?Primary façades. Architectural details which are expressed through the articulation of 
building materials have historic precedents in Fuquay-Varina and the Piedmont region. A 
minimum of two of the following "articulations" or Town approved equivalent alternative 
elements shall be required on all primary façades: 
A. ?Projected lintels in masonry, precast concrete or stone.

wall. 
F. ?Vertical masonry pilasters extending a minimum of two floors and projected from the 
building face a minimum of six inches. 
s. ?Ground floor façades & windows. Individualized shop fronts and business fronts in the 
Downtown Center-2 (DC-2) Zoning District contribute to a positive pedestrian experience. This 
is especially true when these façades are transparent enough to provide a significant visual 
connection between inside and outside the building. To address this connection, the following 
standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Ground floor transparency. Ground floor façades are required to be transparent for no less 
than 30 percent of the horizontal length of the building façade, with clear, nontinted glass, 
or with glass tinted no more than 20 percent, between the heights of three feet and eight 
feet above the public sidewalk. 
(2) ?Glass panel size. Ground floor glass panels are limited to a maximum of four feet wide by 
six feet high and shall be separated by a minimum four inch mullion or post. 
(3) ?Solid base. A solid base constructed of wood, stone, brick or architectural concrete no 
less than two feet high is required between the store front glass and the sidewalk. 
Architectural variation, either solid base or transparent glass, shall account for the one foot 
difference between this requirement and subsection (1) above. 
(4) ?Security. Security gates, bars and doors, including roll-down and horizontal doors, 
whether exterior or interior, are prohibited on all doors and windows on public street 
frontages. 
(5) ?Bay windows. Shop fronts may project a maximum of two feet into the public sidewalk as 
"bay windows." 
t. ?Building materials. The intent of this section is for building materials to be long-lasting, of natural 
materials, and reflect the building traditions of the Piedmont region. Common building materials 
between adjacent buildings are essential for a visually coherent downtown. The following 
standards shall be required for new building construction and reconstruction of existing 
buildings: 
(1) ?Minimum requirements. Brick, stone or architectural concrete must constitute 60 percent 
of primary façades and 40 percent of secondary façades, after subtracting storefronts and 
windows. The balance of the façades must be comprised of wood, stone, architectural 
concrete, synthetic soffits/cornices or concrete siding, such as HardiPlank. Exceptions 
must be approved by the Town Board of Commissioners. The following materials are 
prohibited: 
A. ?Metal siding. 
B. ?Wood or concrete shake siding. 
C. ?Vinyl siding. 
D. ?EIFS (with the exception of detailed horizontal cornices). 
E. ?Split or smooth face concrete block. 
u. ?Roofs & rooflines. Roofs may vary from flat to sloping. Use of similar roof forms will create a 
more unified and cohesive streetscape. Roof forms and heights shall be appropriate to the 
architectural character of the building. Varying roof/parapet heights in downtown contribute to a 
visually interesting streetscape. The following standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Permitted roofs. Flat hip and gable roofs are acceptable. 
(2) ?Prohibited roof. Mansard roofs are prohibited. 
(3) ?Gable ends. Gable "ends" shall not front the street or occur on a primary façade.

these types of roofs are not visible from any point along a public right-of-way. Standing 
steam metal roofs with a 24-inch separation between the seams which are black, brown or 
grey in color shall be permitted. 
(7) ?Parapets. Parapets of no less than 42 inches are required for flat roofs. Parapets must 
extend a minimum of 12 inches above rooftop mounted mechanical equipment. 
(8) ?Cornices. Cornices, when incorporated into the parapet design, must project from 
between six and 12 inches beyond the face of the façade. 
v. ?Color. Color provides continuity from building to building while serving to enhance the visual 
character of downtown. The color palette of a building is composed of the main, trim and accent 
colors. The colors chosen for awnings, canopies, shutters and roofs also contribute to the 
overall color scheme of a building. The overall color scheme of a building or project should 
reflect a cohesive pattern. These provisions recognize that the review of a building's color 
scheme is a balance between an owner's creativity and individuality, the architectural style of 
the building and an overall harmonious vision for the downtown. The main color should be the 
predominant color of the building. The trim color is applied to architectural elements such as 
windows, doors, columns, etc. the following color standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Color palette. The selection of colors for new and existing buildings shall be determined 
from a color palette or equivalent approved by the Town Board of Commissioners and is 
available in the Planning Department.

three-color scheme is required to provide visual appeal. 
(3) ?Trim. The trim color shall be a lighter or darker tone of the main color. 
(4) ?Accent color. In a three-color scheme, the accent color must be used sparingly to highlight 
certain architectural elements such as a front door or awning. 
(5) ?Low reflecting. Colors must be low reflectance. 
(6) ?Bright colors. Bright colors shall be used only as accents. Refer to the color palette 
available in the Planning Department. 
(7) ?Mortar & caulking. Mortar and caulking colors shall be compatible with the predominant 
material. 
(8) ?Color & adjacent buildings. It is not required that a building (existing or new) is the same 
color or color theme as an adjacent building or across from the public right-of-way except 
the color(s) must follow the color palette in subsection v.(1) above or as amended from 
time to time. 
(9) ?Painting masonry. It is permitted to paint a masonry façade, but must follow the color 
palette in subsection p.(1)A., above, or as amended from time to time. 
(10) ?Addition to color palette. When necessary, the Town staff will submit a color palette 
and/or additional colors to the Town Board for review and approval. A request for color(s) 
not consistent with the adopted color palette may be submitted to the Town Board for 
consideration as an addition to the color palette. 
w. ?Building entrances & doors. Individualized entryway design elements and variations are 
encouraged to provide a positive pedestrian experience. Each building must have a clearly 
defined and highly visible entrance featuring at least one of the following architectural features: 
(1) ?Covering. Features over doors and windows include canopy, awning or a portico. 
(2) ?Recessed entrance. Entrance and door recessed behind the building façade a minimum of 
three feet. 
(3) ?Architectural surround. Entrance and door contained within an architectural "surround" of

distinctive atmosphere for downtown residential living creating a positive influence on social 
structure in an urban setting. Multi-family and mixed-use developments in the Downtown 
Center-1 (DC-1) Zoning District are residential types that can be enhanced with the use of 
upper story balconies and porches. The following required standards shall apply: 
(1) ?Minimum clearance. Upper story balconies or porches incorporated into a multi-family, 
mixed-use or townhouse development along a primary or secondary street shall be 
installed with a minimum of nine feet clearance between the bottom of the balcony or porch 
and the surface of the sidewalk. 
(2) ?Maximum encroachment. An upper story balcony or porch shall not extend more than a 
maximum of five feet in depth from the face of the building façade, and further shall not 
cover more than three feet of the sidewalk in the public right-of-way.

public street. This requirement shall also apply to all covered areas along public street 
frontages regardless of their support system (i.e. freestanding or attached to the 
building façade). 
ii. ?Materials. Materials shall be canvas or cloth, fade resistant and fire retardant only, 
except that metal canopies may be permitted when attached to the building façade 
with no columns or post in accordance with the following standards: 
1. ?Maximum length. The canopy shall not extend more than of 90 percent across 
the front of the building. It shall be prohibited for metal canopies to be attached 
between adjacent buildings. 
2. ?Supports. The supports to hold the metal canopy in place shall be round iron rods 
(black or bronze color) angled between 45 degrees and 60 degrees, attached to 
the metal canopy and the building façade wall. The attachment of the iron rods to 
the building façade wall shall include a decorative metal plate colored in contrast 
to the iron rod. The attachment of the iron rods to the top of the canopy shall be 
screened by the face of the canopy. 
3. ?Face of canopy. The face of the canopy shall have a minimum vertical surface of 
12 inches with a minimum extension above and below the horizontal surface of 
the canopy no less than two inches. The face of the canopy shall have a design

exceed a maximum of 24 inches in height measured from the bottom of the awning or 
canopy (see Figure DC-2-13). 
 
Figure DC-2-13
z. ?Upper story windows. Windows shall be spaced to create a pleasing pattern that is reflective of 
the existing architectural character of downtown. Classical proportions shall be followed to guide 
the design of window openings and window groupings. The following required standards shall 
apply: 
(1) ?Window dimensions. Windows shall be taller than they are wide. 
(2) ?Window material. Windows shall be of wood, clad wood, vinyl, steel or fixed aluminum. 
(3) ?Window glass. Window glass shall be clear and nontinted on floors with residential uses 
only. All other nonresidential uses shall meet the same tinting requirements for ground floor

building, or these requirements will not conflict with the designation of the historic/landmark 
property or building. 
cc. ?Conversion of existing residential structure to another use. The conversion of an existing 
residential structure to a nonresidential use shall not constitute bringing the entire structure into 
compliance with this appendix, except where any modifications to the building either due to 
North Carolina State Building Code requirements or by choice of the owner, in total, are in 
excess of 50 percent of the current assessed building value as determined by the Wake County 
Revenue Department.

The purpose of this regulation is to enable, encourage and quantify the implementation of the block, 
building and form-based districts. 
a. ?The block(s) & building(s). 
(1) ?Buildings & landscaping. That buildings and landscaping should contribute to the physical 
definition of thoroughfares as civic places. 
(2) ?Civic space. That civic buildings and public gathering places should be provided as 
locations that reinforce form-based zoning standards. 
(3) ?Civic buildings. Civic buildings should be distinctive and appropriate to a role more 
important than the other buildings that constitute the fabric of the Town. 
b. ?The form-based districts (mixed-use). 
(1) ?Development intensities. That the range of development intensities within each 
neighborhood should provide meaningful choices in living arrangements as manifested by 
the distinct physical environments in each form-based district. 
(2) ?Residential mixed-use. That the Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) District consists of low 
density residential areas, with some mix of use, home occupations and accessory 
buildings. Street and yard planting are naturalistic and building front setbacks are relatively 
deep, ranging from 20 to 30 feet. Blocks may be large and thoroughfare networks irregular, 
connected by continuous sidewalks. Should consist of the lowest allowed density 
residential areas with some commercial in the neighborhood. This district may be applied 
in master plans over 5.1 acres. 
(3) ?Neighborhood mixed-use. That the Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) District includes a 
mix of uses but is primarily mixed density residential. It may have a wide range of dwelling 
types: houses, townhouses, duplexes, small apartment buildings and live/work units. 
Setbacks and landscaping are variable. Streets and sidewalks define medium-sized 
blocks. This district shall be applied in all master plans. 
(4) ?Urban mixed-use. That the Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) District consists of higher density 
mixed-use buildings that accommodate retail, commercial, offices, condominiums, 
townhouses and apartments. It has a tight network of thoroughfares, with wide sidewalks, 
regularly spaced street tree plantings and buildings set close to the sidewalks. This district 
may be applied in master plans over 5.1 acres. 


§ 9-3003. - General rules. 
The following general rules shall apply to standards governing the form-based districts and development 
within them: 
a. ?Numerical metrics. Numerical metrics shall take precedence over graphic metrics. 
b. ?Diagrams & illustrations are regulatory. The diagrams and illustrations within this appendix, 
unless specifically noted as advisory, are considered regulatory in nature and are legally 
binding. 
c. ?Terms & definitions. Terms used throughout this appendix may be defined in Article S 
Interpretations & Definitions and shall be accorded their commonly accepted meanings where

§ 9-3013. - Lot standards. 
a. ?Within each form-based district, lots shall be platted to have the following minimum and maximum lot 
widths, measured at the frontage line (see Table  Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) Standards, Table 
 Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) Standards and Table  Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) Standards). 
(1) ?RMU 50-foot minimum to 150-foot maximum. 
(2) ?NMU 20-foot minimum to 96-foot maximum. 
(3) ?UMU 20-foot minimum to 150-foot maximum. 
b. ?Each lot shall have a primary frontage abutting a vehicular thoroughfare, except that 20 percent of 
the lots within the form-based district may have their primary frontage along a publicly accessible 
passage, or sidewalk. Rear alleys and rear lanes do not count as thoroughfares; any lots fronting an 
alley or lane, such as a mews unit, counts toward the 20 percent maximum. 
c. ?Lots may have multiple frontages as illustrated on Table  Frontages & Elevations. One frontage 
line is designated the principal frontage line and all remaining frontage lines are designed as

continue in operation as they exist until a substantial modification is requested, pursuant to the 
standards of Article K Nonconformities. 
b. ?The modification of existing buildings is permitted by-right if such changes result in greater 
conformance with the specifications of this appendix. 
c. ?The restoration or rehabilitation of an existing building, except in the case of expansion, shall not 
require the provision of (a) parking in addition to that existing nor (b) on-site stormwater 
retention/detention in addition to that existing, unless otherwise required by County, State or 
Federal regulations. 


§ 9-3015. - Plan proposals. 
Plan proposals shall meet the requirements of this appendix, at a minimum, but may also include

pertaining to the project area that are either greater than or in addition to the regulations contained in this 
appendix. To the extent that any master plan and subdivision plat designates any of the following 
additional requirements or conditions, regulations shall be applied as follows: 
a. ?A differentiation of the thoroughfares as A-grid and B-grid. Frontages located more than 100 
feet from the A-grid shall be exempt from the public frontage requirements. The frontages 
assigned to the B-grid shall not exceed 30 percent of the total length of frontages within a 
pedestrian shed. 
b. ?Build-to lines require placement of the building façade on the property line on the A-grid. 
c. ?Mandatory terminated vista locations require that the building be provided with architectural 
articulation of a type and character that responds visually to the location. Recommended 
terminated vista locations advise that the building responds visually to the location. 
d. ?Cross block passages require that a minimum 12-foot-wide pedestrian access be reserved 
between buildings. 
e. ?Any undeveloped area over five acres shall provide connectivity as necessary to comply with a 
master plan.

The placement of the building on its lot is determined by dimensional setbacks and build-to requirements 
as measured from the lot boundary lines. Specific to all form-based districts: 
a. ?Newly platted lots shall be dimensioned, buildings placed in relationship to the boundaries of 
their lots and lot coverage shall be determined according to Table  Residential Mixed-Use 
(RMU) Standards, Table  Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) Standards and Table  Urban 
Mixed-Use (UMU) Standards. 
b. ?One principal building at the frontage, and one accessory building to the rear of the principal 
building, may be built on each lot as shown in Table  Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) 
Standards, Table  Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) Standards and Table  Urban Mixed-
Use (UMU) Standards. 
c. ?Façades shall be built parallel to the principal frontage line or to the tangent of a curved principal 
frontage line, and along a minimum percentage of the frontage width at the setback, as

§ 9-3021. - Sign standards. 
Sign standards shall apply as outlined in Part 9 Land Development Ordinance, Article L Signs of the Land 
Development Ordinance. 


§ 9-3022. - Architectural standards. 
Architectural standards shall apply as outlined in Part 9 Land Development Ordinance, Article H Building

§ 9-3023. - Public realm standards. 
This article establishes design standards for public spaces and thoroughfares for land regulated by this 
article. 
a. ?The design standards set forth in this appendix shall be used as criteria for the planning 
approval process. 
b. ?Provisions of this appendix, when in conflict, take precedence over those of other ordinances 
and standards including, zoning and subdivision regulations, except the Town and Wake 
County Health and Safety Codes, and Wake County, State and Federal regulations, and North 
Carolina State Building Code. 
c. ?Additional licenses, agreements and permits may be required by the Town. 
d. ?Preliminary design drawings and construction drawings for civic spaces, civic buildings, 
thoroughfares and utilities require approval from the Town. 
e. ?Thoroughfare and utility plans submitted for approval must demonstrate compliance with the

(1) ?Thoroughfare standards. 
(2) ?Easement standards. 
(3) ?Public right-of-way landscape standards. 
(4) ?Other applicable standards of this Land Development Ordinance that may apply. 
f. ?Civic space plans submitted for approval must demonstrate compliance with the following: 
(1) ?Civic space standards. 
(2) ?Other applicable standards of this Land Development Ordinance that may apply. 


§ 9-3024. - Thoroughfare standards. 
The primary use of thoroughfares is to provide access to private lots and public civic spaces. In 
accordance with the intent of this appendix, thoroughfares must be designed to support several modes of 
transportation: public transportation, motor vehicles and nonmotorized modes of transportation such as 
bicycles and pedestrians. 
a. ?All thoroughfares shall terminate at other thoroughfares at intersections, forming a network. 
Where topological conditions exist that restrict the ability to form road networks, a pedestrian 
connection shall be made. Right-of-way shall be dedicated along with the construction of streets 
to complete road networks to adjacent lots and right-of-way improvements made to adjacent 
property. 
b. ?All thoroughfare cross-sections shall be designed utilizing the elements generally illustrated on 
Table  Pre-Approved Assemblies. Thoroughfare cross-sections must be designed in 
accordance with this subsection and constructed in accordance with the Town's Standard 
Specifications & Construction Details. Any proposed streets adopted in the Town's Community 
Transportation Plan (CTP) within the project area shall be constructed to meet CTP standards. 
Perimeter and boundary streets shall be constructed to any existing Town standards. Street 
improvements related to CTP requirements shall comply with North Carolina Department of 
Transportation requirements. 
c. ?All thoroughfares cross-sections shall consist of a transportation way and public frontage 
assemblies, as generally illustrated in Table  Transportation Way, Table  Public Frontage 
Types, and the following requirements: 
(1) ?Thoroughfare cross-sections must be configured by related form-based district and 
thoroughfare cross-section types, according to Table  Pre-Approved Assemblies, and 
must be mapped on a thoroughfare network plan submitted with the master plan. Table  
Pre-Approved Assemblies includes pre-approved thoroughfare assemblies for use under 
this appendix. 
(2) ?The transportation way may include vehicular lanes, parking bays, medians, access lanes 
and transportation provisions. 
A. ?Elements of the transportation way must be configured and sized according to Table 
 Transportation Way, using street cross-sections in Table  Pre-Approved 
Assemblies. 
B. ?Medians, when used, may include civic spaces and shall be designed to meet the 
level of public planting and adjacent public frontages. 
C. ?Parking bays for on-street parking shall be eight feet in width for parallel parking and 
18 feet in width for reverse angled parking, unless otherwise provided by the 
approved thoroughfare assemblies. Tick marks, where required, identifying parking 
bays must be within the parking lane width. 
(3) ?Existing thoroughfares may be painted temporarily to comply with new configurations 
required by the thoroughfare network plan, including the addition of any transportation 
provisions, subject to NCDOT and Town of Fuquay-Varina approval prior to any changes 
being made. 
(4) ?Alley standards. Alley easements include one bi-directional vehicular lane, within a total 
width of 16 to 24 feet. The entire right-of-way should be paved. Alley assemblies do not 
include transportation ways or public frontages. Alleys may be located in Urban Mixed-Use 
(UMU) and Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) Districts. 
(5) ?Rear lane standards. Rear lane easements include one bi-directional vehicular lane, within 
a total width no more than ten feet. Only the vehicular lane and driveways should be 
paved. Rear lanes do not include transportation ways and public frontages. Rear lanes 
may be located in Neighborhood Mixed-Use (NMU) and Residential Mixed-Use (RMU) 
Districts. 
(6) ?Except for thoroughfares with angle or reverse-angle parking, bulbouts/curb extensions 
will not be applied to thoroughfares under this article. 
(7) ?Where one or both sides of a thoroughfare are "no parking," per preapproved assemblies, 
"no parking" signage shall be posted accordingly. 
(8) ?Public frontage. Thoroughfare cross-sections must include public frontages configured 
according to Table  Pre-Approved Assemblies; consisting of planters, walkways, curbs, 
verges and lighting, spacing may be adjusted for local conditions, as generally illustrated in 
Table  Public Frontage Types. 
A. ?Elements of the public frontage assembly that pass from one form-based district to 
another must be blended to the character of the form-based district's adjacent lots. 
Elements of public frontage assembly that pass from a form-based district to a 
traditional district should be blended to the character of the form-based district. 
B. ?Public frontage assemblies shall be assigned and configured according to Table  
Pre-Approved Assemblies. Assemblies including a walkway or planter shall specify a 
minimum width. 
C. ?While streets may be designed in a straight-line grid, any streets that curve must have 
a minimum curve radius of 100-foot tangent with no double-backs. 
D. ?Public frontage assemblies shall assign a verge, providing allowable locations for 
public infrastructure and public furniture outside of pedestrian and vehicular access 
ways. 
E. ?Lighting & planting standards. Public frontage assemblies lighting and planting should 
follow these requirements: 
i. ?Public lighting must be located within the verge and consistent with Table  
Private Frontages and the lighting standards of Article N Parking, Loading & 
Lighting Design Standards and of the Town's Standard Specifications & 
Construction Details, as amended. 
ii. ?Public planting must be designed in accordance with Table  Public Frontage 
Types. No tree planted within the public frontage shall be planted within 30 feet 
of an intersection. 
iii. ?At retail frontages, the spacing of trees may be irregular to avoid visually 
obscuring shopfront(s) but in no case shall trees be spaced more than 40 feet 
apart. 
iv. ?At gallery frontages, public planting is not required and public lighting may be 
provided within the gallery.

§ 9-3025. - Emergency service access. 
Access for emergency services will be maintained and provided through these mechanisms: 
a. ?Fire apparatus access roads with 20 feet clear between parked cars are commonly referred to 
as "fire access roadway," and shall be accessible by emergency services equipment. Most 
Urban Mixed-Use (UMU) District thoroughfares will satisfy or exceed this requirement. 
b. ?Block lengths on thoroughfares that are not fire access streets is limited to block face lengths of 
300 feet to accommodate hose runs, unless structures on the block are also within 300 feet of a 
fire access street. 
c. ?On-street parking will not be permitted within 30 feet of an intersection curb radius return on any 
thoroughfare to permit emergency vehicle turning movements. 
d. ?Every neighborhood street with a ten-foot travel lane or less than 24 feet clear will provide a 
mid-block fire access staging area, which will be stripped from curb to curb for 40 feet in length 
and marked "no parking fire lane." The fire access staging area will be located in the middle of 
the block if the block length is 300 feet or no less than one every 300 feet. Fire access staging 
areas shall be no less than 300 feet apart and no less than 300 feet from the intersection. 


§ 9-3026. - Easement standards. 
a. ?Utility easements must be located as generally illustrated in Table  Utility Easements. 
b. ?Easements shall be provided for utilities pursuant to these easement standards or as otherwise 
required. 
c. ?Where a preliminary plat is traversed by a water course, drainage way, channel or stream not 
otherwise protected, there shall be provided a drainage easement conforming substantially to 
the lines of such water course, and such further width or construction, or both, as will be

§ 9-3028. - Bicycles. 
A general network of correctly dimensioned thoroughfares is usable by bicyclist sharing lanes with slow 
moving motor vehicles or with dedicated bicycle lanes. 
a. ?Thoroughfares in Table  Pre-Approved Assemblies that have design and operating speeds of 
30 miles per hour or less, as indicated by Table  Transportation Way, are designed to 
accommodate bicycles in the travel lanes. For larger thoroughfares, bicycle lanes and shared 
lane markings are included in the thoroughfare cross-sections. 
b. ?Though not shown in the thoroughfare tables for design speeds of 30 miles per hour or less, 
uphill bike lanes may be provided to allow "climbing lane" for cyclist if needed. Downhill bike 
lanes should be avoided; shared lane markings should be used on downhill sections. 


§§ 9-3029 THROUGH 9-3999. - Reserved. 


Appendix C - Town Center Residential District 


§ 9-4000. - Purpose. 
The Town of Fuquay-Varina is committed to a viable self-supporting economic Fuquay-Varina downtown 
area that serves as a destination. The Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District is intended primarily 
to accommodate residents specifically within a reasonable distance (one-fourth to one-half mile) of the 
downtown area. The Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District offers the opportunity for a mix of 
residential uses with some supporting retail and office uses at designated locations, to complement and 
enhance a vibrant mix of uses that supports the resilience and sustainability of the downtown districts. 


§ 9-4001. - Intent. 
The intent of the Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District is to allow design flexibility, housing types 
that offer choices, retail and office and institutional uses for convenience, and to increase recreational 
opportunities and mobility for pedestrians. The desire to create, integrate, encourage and sustain viable 
opportunities in this district is supported by performance standards as follows: 
a. ?Civic space. Introduce civic space in the form of squares or greens that offer activities and 
connectivity for residents. 
b. ?Master plan. The Town Center Residential Zoning District requires approval of a master plan in 
accordance with the standards of Article Q Procedures & Administration, section 9-1808 
Common Application Procedures, u. Master Plan. The size and detail included in a master plan 
shall be relative to the size of the specific project. For projects resulting in four or less residential 
or mixed-use lots or parcels, a plot plan shall serve as the required master plan. 
c. ?Preservation of natural environment. Ensure that development preserves the natural 
environment for public use and enjoyment as well as provide for the protection of property from 
flooding or other natural disasters. 
d. ?Public transportation. Establish land use patterns that promote opportunities for public 
transportation that will serve all age groups, disabilities, income and service needs. 
e. ?Residential use. Provide for a variety of single-family residential types with flexibility in lot size 
introducing, for example cottage homes, row houses on "shotgun" lots and secondary units on a 
single lot. The use of multi-family residential types is designed to be appropriately located where 
office and retail uses would be prominent. A main component of a sustainable downtown center 
is people that live in or in close proximity to the downtown. The Town Center Residential (TCR) 
Zoning District is a transitional district that provides energy and service support for the 
downtown center. To support this energy the district needs to create a greater variety of housing 
types and opportunities for residents to live in close proximity to the downtown. 
f. ?Retail & office use. Introduce limited and specific retail and offices to serve local residences 
limited by lot size and building square footage and permit second story apartments. 
g. ?Vehicle & pedestrian mobility. Maintain mobility by utilizing and expanding upon the existing grid 
pattern for new development and reconstruction to serve vehicles and pedestrians facilities that 
are linked specifically to the downtown area, with an efficient and compact network of streets 
and utilities. Permit and encourage alleys as access to residential, office and retail services. 


§ 9-4002. - District boundary. 
Zoning property to the Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District shall be limited to properties 
located within the boundary of Judd Parkway as identified on the Community Transportation Plan. The 
Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District is prohibited from being applied to any properties outside 
the boundary herein described. 


§ 9-4003. - General standards. 
The standards for the Town Center Residential (TCR) Zoning District are designed to provide for and 
permit different types of residential development and small compact retail and office type uses to provide 
service for residents within this District. 
a. ?Interpretation of the tableTCR Zoning District dimensions & standards. 
(1) ?Minimum lot size & dimensions. Minimum lot size is measured in square feet, unless 
otherwise specified, and minimum lot width is measured in linear feet. 
(2) ?Maximum height. Maximum height shall be measured in linear feet and determined in 
accordance with the definition provided in Article S Interpretations & Definitions, except as 
otherwise permitted in this article. 
(3) ?Setback measurement. Minimum setbacks shall be measured in linear and are applicable 
to the perimeter of a zoning lot, and are not applicable between units, structures or 
buildings, except as required by the North Carolina State Building Code Regulations. 
(4) ?A blank cell indicates that there is no applicable minimum for the dimension or standard, 
unless otherwise specifically stated in Article F Use Regulations.
