
PREFACE

The Town of Plaistow has, over the years, passed through a process of legislative change common to many American communities. While only a few simple laws were necessary at the time of the establishment of the town, subsequent growth of the community, together with the complexity of modem life, has created the need for new and more detailed legislation for the proper function and government of the town. The recording of local law is an aspect of municipal history, and as the community develops and changes, review and revision of old laws and consideration of new laws, in the light of current trends, must keep pace. The orderly collection of these records is an important step in this ever-continuing process. Legislation must be more than mere chronological enactments reposing in the pages of old records. It must be available and logically arranged for convenient use and must be kept up-to-date. It was with thoughts such as these in mind that the Town Meeting ordered the following codification of the town's legislation .


Contents of Code

The various chapters of the Code contain all currently effective ordinances of a general and permanent nature enacted by the Town Meeting and Board of  Selectmen,  as well  as certain rules and regulations adopted by the Planning Board which were deemed to be general and permanent in nature and appropriate for inclusion in the volume.


Division of Code

The Code is divided into parts. Part I contains ordinances adopted by the Town Meeting and Board of Selectmen. Part II contains rules and regulations adopted by the Planning Board.


Grouping of Legislation and Arrangement of Chapters

The various items of legislation are organized  into chapters, their order being an alphabetical progression from one subject to another. Wherever there are two or more items of legislation dealing with the same subject, they are combined into a single chapter. Thus, for example, all legislation pertaining to the regulation of streets and sidewalks may be found in Part I, in the chapter entitled "Streets and  Sidewalks." In such chapters,  use  of article or part designations has preserved the identity of the individual items of legislation .


Table of Contents

The Table of Contents details the alphabetical arrangement of material by chapter as a means of identifying specific areas of legislation. Wherever two or more items of legislation have been combined by the editor into a single chapter, titles of the several articles are listed beneath the chapter title in order to facilitate the location of the individual item of legislation .





)
 

Reserved Chapters

Space has been provided in the Code for the convenient insertion, alphabetically, of later enactments. In the Table of Contents such space appears as chapters entitled "(Reserved)." In the body of the Code, reserved space is provided by breaks in the page-numbering sequence between chapters.


Pagination

A unique page-numbering system has been used, in which each  chapter  forms  an autonomous unit. One hundred pages have been allotted to each chapter, and the first page of each is the number of that chapter followed by the numerals "01." Thus, Chapter 6 begins on page 601, Chapter 53 on page 5301, etc. By use of this system, it is possible to add or to change pages in any chapter without affecting the sequence of subsequent pages in other chapters, and to insert new chapters without affecting the existing organization.


Numbering of Sections

A chapter-related section-numbering system is employed, in which each section of every item of legislation is assigned a number which indicates both the number of the chapter in which the legislation is located and the location of the section within that chapter. Thus, the first section of Chapter 6 is § 6-1, while the fourth section of Chapter 53 is § 53-4. New sections can then be added between existing sections using a decimal system. Thus, for example, if two sections were to be added between §§ 53-4 and 53-5, they would be numbered
as §§ 53-4.1 and 53-4.2.	)


Scheme

The Scheme is the list of section titles which precedes the text of each chapter. These titles are carefully written so that, taken together, they may be considered as a summary of the content of the chapter. Taken separately, each describes the content of a particular section. For ease and precision of reference, the Scheme titles are repeated as section headings in the text.


Histories

At the end of the Scheme in each chapter is located the legislative history for that chapter. This History indicates the specific legislative source from which the chapter was derived, including the enactment number (e.g., ordinance number, local law number, bylaw number, resolution number, etc.), if pertinent, and the date of adoption. In the case of chapters containing parts or articles derived from more than one item of legislation, the source of each part or article is indicated in the text, under its title. Amendments to individual sections or subsections are indicated by histories where appropriate in the text.


General References; Editor's Notes

In each chapter containing material related to other chapters in the Code, a table of General References is included to direct the reader's attention to such related chapters. Editor's Notes
)


ii
 

are  used  in  the  text  to  provide  supplementary  information  and  cross-references  to  related provisions in other chapters.


Appendix

Certain forms of local legislation are not of a nature suitable for inclusion in the main body of the Code but are of such significance that their application is community-wide or their provisions are germane to the conduct of municipal government. The Appendix of this Code is reserved for such legislation and for any other material that the community may wish to include.


Disposition List

The Disposition List is a chronological listing of legislation adopted since the publication of the Code, indicating its inclusion in the Code or the reason for its exclusion. The Disposition List will be updated with each supplement to the Code to include the legislation reviewed with said  supplement.


Index

The Index is a guide to information. Since it is likely that this Code will be used by persons without formal legal training, the Index has been formulated to enable such persons to locate a particular section quickly. Each section of each chapter has been indexed. The Index will be supplemented and revised from time to time as new legislation is added to the Code.


Instructions for Amending the Code

All changes to the Code, whether they are amendments, deletions or complete new additions, should be adopted as amending the Code. In doing so, existing material that is not being substantively altered should not be renumbered.

Adding new sections. Where new sections are to be added to a chapter, they can be added at the end of the existing material (continuing the numbering sequence) or inserted between existing sections as decimal numbers (e.g., a new section between§§ 65-5 and 65-6 should be designated§  65-5.1).

Adding new chapters. New chapters should be added in the proper alphabetical sequence, utilizing the reserved chapter numbers. New chapter titles should begin with the key word for the alphabetical listing (e.g., new legislation on abandoned vehicles should be titled "Vehicles, Abandoned" under "V" in the table of contents, and a new enactment on coin-operated amusement devices should be "Amusement Devices" or "Amusement Devices, Coin-Operated" under "A" in the table of contents). Where a reserved number is not available, an "A" chapter should be used (e.g., a new chapter to be included between Chapters 166 and 167 should be designated Chapter 166A).

Adding new articles. New articles may be inserted between existing articles in a chapter (e.g., adding a new district to the Zoning Regulations) by the use of "A" articles (e.g., a new




iii
 

article to be included between Articles XVI and XVII should be designated Article XVIA). The section numbers would be as indicated above (e.g., if the new Article XVIA contains six sections and existing Article XVI ends with§ 166-30 and Article XVII begins with§ 166-31, Article XVIA should contain §§ 166-30.1 through 166-30.6). NOTE: In chapters where articles appear on the Table of Contents, simply add new articles to the end of the chapter since they are not arranged by subject matter.


Supplementation

Supplementation of the Code will follow the adoption of new legislation. New legislation or amendments to existing legislation will be included and repeals will be indicated as soon as possible after passage. Supplemental pages should be inserted as soon as they are received and old pages removed, in accordance with the  Instruction  Page  which  accompanies  each supplement.


Acknowledgment

The assistance of the town officials is gratefully  acknowledged  by  the  editor.  The codification of the legislation of the Town of Plaistow reflects an appreciation  of the needs of a progressive and expanding community. As in  many  other  municipalities,  officials  are  faced with fundamental changes involving nearly every facet of community life. Problems increase in number and complexity and range in importance from everyday details to crucial areas of civic planning.  It is the profound  conviction  of General  Code Publishers  Corp. that this Code will
contribute significantly to the efficient administration of local government. As Samuel Johnson	)
observed,  "The law is the last result  of human wisdom  acting upon  human  experience for the
benefit of the public."

DONATIONS TO TOWN

§ 61-1. Purpose.	§ 61-4. Acceptance or rejection of donations.
§ 61-2. Policy established.	§ 61-5. Procedures established.
§ 61-6. Annual reporting.

[HISTORY: Adopted by the Board of Selectmen of the Town of Plaistow 7-9-2007. Amended 1-7-2019 and as noted.]

GENERAL REFERENCES

Conflicts of interest – See Ch. 56.	Investment policy – See Ch. 99.


§ 61-1. Purpose.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures for the acceptance of donations to the Town. In general, donations can benefit the Town by allowing expansion of programs or services while not placing further undue burden on taxpayers. A uniform set of procedures shall be followed in acceptance of all donations, and proper approval shall be obtained prior to acceptance. All cash, equipment, in-kind services, materials and sponsorships donated to the Town shall be accounted for in accordance with the procedures set forth in this policy.

§ 61-2. Policy established.

A.	The Town Manger will approve or reject offers of donations of money, equipment and in-kind  contributions or sponsorships to Town departments or the Town in general up to
$10,000. Donated money will be expended for general purposes within the department or specified purposes, if agreed upon with the donor, as one-time supplements to the department’s operating budget. Donations will be considered based on department goals
and needs. Each donation will be evaluated for usefulness and costs of potential replacement and/or ongoing operation. In-kind contributions and sponsorships for specific
events will be treated in the same way as donated funds. The Town Manager will announce receipt of these donations at a public meeting of the Board of Selectmen.

B.	For monetary donations of less than $10,000, the Board of Selectmen must post notice of the funds in its meeting agenda and include notice in the minutes of the meeting at which the funds are discussed. Acceptance of the funds must occur during a public meeting.

C.	For monetary, equipment and in-kind contributions or sponsorships with values over
$10,000, a report to the Board will be written by the Town Manager outlining the purpose of each donation and the advantages and disadvantages of accepting the gift. For monetary donations, a public hearing on the action to be taken must be held and notice of such a hearing will be published in the newspaper at least seven days prior to the hearing. The Board of Selectmen will decide, on a per-case basis, if donations should be accepted or rejected. Corporations offering sponsorships or in-kind contributions will be requested to state the value of the offered service.




61:1	1-07-2019
 


D.	The receipt of a donation cannot in any way obligate the Town, its department heads or staff to provide to the donor any consideration in the normal conduct of Town business, either directly or indirectly, that is any way differentiated from a nondonor.

§ 61-3. Definitions.

As used in this chapter, the following terms shall have the meaning indicated:

GIFT or DONATION – The terms “gift” and “donation” shall be synonymous and may be a monetary contribution and/or equipment, in-kind good or services or sponsorships which a Town department or the Town has accepted and for which the donor has not received any goods or service in return.

§ 61-4. Acceptance or rejection of donations.

A.	Responsibility. Upon acceptance of a donation by the Board of Selectmen, responsibility for management of donations shall lie with each department head having authority to expend donations up to the value of $10,000 as determined by the Town Manager. All donations that exceed $10,000 must be approved by the Board of Selectmen. The Finance Department will establish separate donation accounts to track receipt and expenditure of donations.

B.	Accepting unsolicited donations. Unsolicited donations shall be accepted only if they have a valid use to the Town.

(1)	Donors who wish to give a gift which is not specific to a given department may give a gift to the Town in general. The Town Manager will recommend whether such gifts should go to a specific department or to the general fund.

(2)	If the item obviously has no use to the Town or would be more effectively used elsewhere, the donor will be informed, as soon as possible, and referred to an appropriate agency by the Town Manager, in the case of general gifts, or the department where it was offered.

(3)	Proof of ownership. If there is any question as to the legal owner of the donated item, proof of ownership may be requested.

(4)	Restrictions. Donors shall be encouraged to place minimal restrictions on donated items or funds, allowing the Town department or the Town in general as much flexibility as possible on determining its use.

C.	Accepting solicited donations. From time to time, department heads may have the opportunity to discuss donations of money, equipment, in-kind services or materials or sponsorships with individuals and businesses.

(1)	Department heads whose positions involve direct regulatory responsibility should refrain from direct solicitation or receipt of donations. If an opportunity arises in
such a situation, the department head should refer the possible donation opportunity to the Town Manger. If the Town Manager does not feel that he or she can provide
sufficient independent guidance, the donation opportunity will be referred to the Board of Selectmen for its review.

61:2	01-07-2019
 


(2)	Department heads should review all solicited donations with the Town Manager. Any solicited donation with a value exceeding $5,000 should be referred to the Town Manager prior to solicitation.  The Town Manager will disclose the nature of  the solicitation to the Board of Selectmen prior to the solicitations. Any solicitation over
$10,000 will require the approval of the Board of Selectmen prior to the solicitation.

D.	Conditions for accepting/rejecting donations. Staff shall work with the donor to assure that restrictions are reasonable and do not leave the donor with unrealistic expectations regarding permanency of life of the donation. The following are criteria which may be applied in determining if a donation is appropriate for acceptance:

(1)	Is the use of the item or money for a designated purchase consistent with existing Town Policy and department/Town goals?

(2)	Do restrictions upon the use of the item or funds make it impracticable to accept?

(3)	Do restrictions on disposal or retention of the item or funds make it impracticable to accept?

(4)	Is required accounting for the item or funds excessively difficult?

(5)	Would equipment require extensive repair or maintenance, and if so, is maintenance support available?

(6)	Does use of equipment or materials require the purchase of additional items to be useful?

(7)	Does acceptance of funds, equipment or in-kind services or materials present a conflict of interest for the Town or its employees? Regardless of the value of the donation, if the donor is a contractor, potential contractor or if there is reason to believe there may be a conflict of interest, then the Town Manager will provide a written determination explaining if the gift should be accepted, rejected or submitted to the Board of Selectmen for approval.

(8) Will the donation result in an increase to the Town’s budget? Recipients must bear in mind that donations are to be considered one-time supplements to departments and should not be used to develop new programs or services which would require budget supplements from the Town in the current or subsequent years, without concurrence from the Board of Selectmen.

§ 61-5. Procedures established.

A.	Gifts valued at $5,000 or less.

(1)	The donor, not staff, must place a value on the gift.

(2)	The department head, or Town Manager will acknowledge each gift by letter, thanking the donor for the gift.

B.	Gifts valued at more than $5,000
.


61:3	01-07-2019
 


(1)	All gifts valued at more than $5,000 as determined by the donor require Board of Selectmen approval before solicitation, if solicitation occurs. Subsequent to the Board’s acceptance, procedures for acceptance of gifts in excess of $5,000 shall be the same as those in Subsection A above.

C.	Cash gifts.

(1)	Depositing and expending cash gifts. All cash gifts shall be deposited immediately after acceptance with the Treasurer and shall be accompanied by an explanation of the donation’s purpose. Funds will be credited to each department’s donation account or in the Town’s general fund, if appropriate. Funds can also be expended from those accounts. Each department head will oversee accounting and expenditures for funds that are deposited in department donation accounts. The Town Manager will oversee general donations to the Town when a specific department is not designated by the donor.

(2)	Recording cash donations. Donations must be supported in department records showing the name of the donor, the amount and date of the donation, and the nature of restrictions on spending, if any.

(3)	Procedures for expending donated cash. The donations may be spent from each department’s donation fund when an appropriate purchase is made. Funds shall remain in this account until they are spent for their intended purpose. Donations can be  carried  over  to  the  new  fiscal  year  in  each  department’s  donation  fund.

D.	Noncash gifts. Donations of equipment and/or in-kind services or materials can be accepted by the Town Manager if values are under $5,000. Equipment or in-kind services or materials valued over  $5,000 by the donor must be accepted by the Board of Selectmen. The Town Manager will report on receipt of noncash donations on a regular basis.

§ 61-6. Annual reporting.

A.	Annually, all donations received within the previous 12 months will be reported. This report will be given to both the Board of Selectmen and the Budget Committee. Donations will be categorized into those that supplement Town programs and services and those that supplant expenditures that would otherwise be charged to the operating budget. In this way, the Town will be able to review any reliance for maintaining current levels of service that rely on donations and appropriate planning can occur for managing those levels of service in the case when donations may no longer be available.

B.	Whenever a petition is filed with the Health Officer by at least 10 residents of the municipality charging that any dwelling is unfit for human habitation or  whenever  it appears to the Health Officer by inspection that any dwelling is unfit for human habitation, he shall, if preliminary investigation discloses a basis for such charges, issue and cause to be served upon the owner, every mortgagee of record and all parties in interest in such dwelling (including persons in possession)  a complaint stating the charges in that respect.

registered  mail,  and  if  there  are any  unascertained  persons  having  an  interest  in  said                                      )
dwelling, notice may be given them by publication in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality, such publication to be at least 10 days before the date set for the hearing. Such complaint shall contain a notice that a hearing will be held before the Plaistow Health Officer at a place therein fixed not less than 10 days nor more than 30 days after the serving of said complaint; that the owner, mortgagee and parties in interest shall be given the right to file an answer to that complaint and to appear in person, or otherwise, and give testimony at the place and time fixed in the complaint; and that the rules of evidence prevailing in courts of law or equity shall not be controlling in hearings before the Health Officer.

C.

§ 138-36. Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA).

A.	Definitions and leave requirement.

(1)	FMLA requires the Town of Plaistow to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid, job­ protected leave to eligible employees for certain family and medical reasons. "Eligible employees" refers to those who have worked for the town for at least one year and for 1,250 hours over the previous twelve-month period. FMLA leave during this twelve­ month period will be measured backwards from the date an employee uses any FMLA leave. Leave may be granted after the Town Manager's receipt of the proper written application and his/her subsequent approval of the terms of the leave.

(2)	Unpaid leave will be granted for any of the following reasons :

(a)	To care for the employee's child after birth or placement for adoption or foster care;

(b)	To care fer the employee's spouse, son, or daughter or parent who has serious health conditions; or

(c)	For a  serious health  condition  that  makes the employ ee unable  to perform  the
)	employee's job.

(3)	Leave may be taken for childbirth or adoption or foster care placement of a child only within 12 months of that childbirth, adoption or placement. For first-year care of a child, adoption, or foster placement, the town may require that FMLA leave be taken on a full-time basis. However, leave may be taken on an intermittent or reduced basis if another arrangement is agreed to by the Town Manager. Leave for serious health conditions, either of a family member or the employee, may be taken intermittently or on a reduced schedule if medically necessary . The preferred  minimum  time  for FMLA leave taken on an intermittent basis is two hours per workday.

(4)	In the event of foreseeable leave, the town may require 30 days' notice for either full-time or intermittent leave. If the employee is unable to provide 30 days' notice, then (s)he must provide such notice as is practicable. If an employee's request for intermittent leave is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment, the town may require the employee to transfer temporarily to an alternate position, with equivalent pay and benefits, that better accommodates recurring periods of leave than the employee's regular position . Employees are required to make a reasonable effort to schedule treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the operation of the Town of Plaistow.

(5)	The town may require employees to first use their paid vacation, personnel or sick leave as a substitute for any part of the twelve-week FMLA leave period. If paid leave is  used by an employee, the town will provide only enough unpaid leave to total twelve weeks. The town is not required to provide paid sick leave or medical leave in any situation where the town does not already provide that leave.
)


13815
 
§ 138-36	PLAISTOW  CODE	§ 138-36

(6)	In the case of full-time FMLA leave, upon request of the Town Manager and Selectmen's approval, a temporary employee may be hired  for the  duration  of  the leave of absence. This temporary employee will not be extended any fringe benefits offered by the town other than  workmen's compensation and disability insurance or other federal/state mandated items.

B.	Certification.

(1)	The town may require that an employee provide certification of his/her own serious health condition or that of a family member . If requested, the employee must provide a copy of such certification to the town in a timely manner. The town may periodically require subsequent recertification. Certification is to include the date on which the serious health condition in question began; the probable duration of the condition; a statement that the employee is needed to care for a spouse, parent or child (along with an estimate of the time required), or that the employee is unable to perform his/her functions; and, in case of intermittent leave, the dates and durations of treatments to be given.

(2)	The town may require that a second or third opinion be obtained, at the town's own expense, if there is a question about the certification  provided  by  the  employee's health care provider. The second and third opinion may be provided by a health care provider selected by the tov;n.

(3)	A return to work certificate, signed by a health care provider, may  be required  of those employees on a personal  medical  leave of absence. Employee s returning  from
extended leaves of absence must notify the town at least 10 working days in advance                                      )
of  their  projected  return  or  the  end  of  the  leave  period,  whichever  comes  first.
Employees will be returned to work as soon as the town receives certification  from the employee's health care provider of the employee's ability to perform essential functions of the job and as the work schedule permits .

C.	Employment and benefits protection.

(1)	An employee who completes a period of  leave is to be returned either to the same position (s)he had before or to a position equivalent in pay, benefits, and other terms and conditions of employment.

(2) Leave is not to result in the loss of any previously accrued seniority or employment benefits, but neither are any benefits required to accrue during the leave. Health benefits continue through an employee's leave. The town may recover health coverage premiums paid for an employee who fails to return from leave, except if the reason is the continuation, reoccurrence, or onset of a serious health condition, or something else beyond the employee's control. This is subject to certification.

D.	Exceptions.

(1)	FMLA provides a limited exception from the restoration requirement to  those employees who are salaried and in the highest paid 10% of the town's work  force within a seventy-five-mile radius of the employee's work site. The town may deny restoration of returning one of these employees if it would substantially impact the daily  operations  or management  of  the  town.  If the  key  executive  utilizing  FMLA



13816
 
§ 138-36	PERSONNEL  PLAN	§ 138-37

leave does so for a compensable illness or injury, then the town must maintain reinstatement rights for said individual as required under New Hampshire's Workmen's Compensation Law.

(2)	A key employee who takes leave is still eligible for continuation of health benefits, even if the employee has been notified that reinstatement will be denied. Under those circumstances, no recovery of premium may be made by the town, if the employee has chosen to take or continue leave after receiving such notice.

(3)	The town must notify the employee of its intent not to restore the employee at the time when the determination is made. If the leave has begun, the employee must have the option of deciding whether or not to return after receiving the notice.

The town shall pay the employee base pay charged to sick time until the claim is processed.

D.	At any time after a job-related disability, the employee may request that accrued vacation or sick time be used to supplement the payments as noted above. In no case shall the combination of accrued leave benefits and the compensation received from the workers' compensation equal more than 100% of the employee's regular rate of pay.

§ 138-37	PLAISTOW  CODE	§ 138-38

F.	Under Workers' Compensation Law, New Hampshire RSA 281-A:25, an employee is entitled to reinstatement for up to 18 months following a compensable injury. In effect, the injured employee is in a leave of absence status until the  time  period  elapses,  he/she returns, procures other employment, or he/she is determined to be permanently unable to return.

G.	An employee who has sustained an injury shall be reinstated by the employer to the employee's former position of employment upon request for such reinstatement, if the position exists and is available and the employee is not disabled from performing the duties of such position, with reasonable accommodations for the employee's limitations. An employee's former position is available even if that position has been filled by a replacement while the injured employee was absent. If the former position has been eliminated, the employee shall be reinstated in any other existing position which is vacant and	suitable with reasonable accommodations for the employee's limitations. Reinstatement rights are not available for seasonal or temporary employees, part-time employees, and employees targeted for reduction in force or layoff under provisions of this Personnel Plan.

H.	A certificate by the employee's attending physician stating the physician's approval for the employee's return to work with reasonable accommodations for the employee's limitations may be required by the town prior to the employee's return to work.

I.		During the period a person is disabled, as a result of a job-related injury, all benefits continue and accumulate if applicable . Should the period of disability continue into the next calendar year, and the employee has been unable to take accumulated vacation time,
such time may  be carried  over to the next  year.  In the event the employee  becomes                                 )
permanently disabled or leaves the employ of the town, the employee will be paid for such vacation at a rate consistent with the pay during the period the vacation would have been normally taken.

J.	The town may provide temporary  alternate work opportunities for injured employees.
Provisions of this procedure  are covered in§ 138-39 below.


§ 138-38. Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

A. The ADA requires reasonable accommodation in the application process, in enabling a qualified individual with a disability to perform essential job functions, and in enabling an employee with a disability to enjoy equal benefits and privileges in employment.

B.	The ADA broadly defines a person with a disability as an individual who:

(1)	Has  a physical  or mental  impairment  that  limits  one or more  of  his/her  major  life
activities (e.g., walking, speaking, seeing, hearing, etc.);

(2)	Has a record of such impairment; and

(3)	Is regarded as having such an impairment.

C.	The ADA prohibits discrimination even if the disabled applicant or employee requires a reasonable accommodation in order to perform the job's essential functions unless doing so would represent  an undue hardship to the town. Reasonable  accommodations may
)


13818
 
§ 138-38	PERSONNEL  PLAN	§ 138-39

)		include changes in job duties and responsibilities, physical changes in the workplace, changes in work schedules, and other forms of assistance that could represent costs to the town.

D.  The Town Manager or his/her designee is responsible for designating an ADA coordinator.
This person shall be responsible for the town's compliance with this law.


§ 138-39. Temporary alternative duty policy statement.

A.	In compliance with New Hampshire state law, the Town of Plaistow will be providing temporary alternative work opportunities to all employees disabled by a work-related injury or illness. As soon as the treating physician has released the employee to lighter duties than the current position requires, subsequent to said injury or illness, the employee will be called upon to return to employment in a temporary alternative position. Employees whose medical condition would permit the use of FMLA may use that leave rather than take the temporary alternative position offered. Such reassignment may include assignment to a different department or position within the town.

B.	Alternative duty procedures. The Town of Plaistow Temporary Alternative Duty (TAD) Program is available for a maximum of 12 weeks. The TAD program is not intended to address those situations wherein the employee has been deemed to be  permanently disabled from resuming his/her previous position .

(1)	The injured employee will pick up a physician's statement or certificate and a copy of his/her current job description from the coordinator of the TAD program while reporting the injury. If the nature of the injury is such that emergency care precludes stopping to pick up these forms, the employee shall as soon as possible call the TAD coordinator to request that a certificate and position description be mailed to the treating physician.

(2)	The employee will have the physician complete the form based on the findings during the initial examination.

(3)	The employee may return the completed form to the TAD coordinator immediately after seeking medical care.

(4)	The TAD coordinator will work with the employee, representative and the department head to facilitate a safe return to work program .

(5)	The TAD coordinator or department head may contact the  treating physician if additional information is necessary.

(6)	After each subsequent office visit, the employee will bring updated information from the treating physician to the TAD coordinator. A note will be sufficient in most cases.

(7)	Additional modifications will be made to the return to work program as required. The TAD coordinator will review the appropriateness of continuing the program or duty assignment.

(8)	Steps 4 through 7 may be repeated until such time as the employee is able to return to his/her normal position or has been deemed to be perman ently disabled.

Disciplinary and Sexual Harassment Procedures

§ 138-40. Disciplinary actions and appeals.

A.	Purpose.

(1)	As   public   employees,   actions   and   behavior   reflect   directly   upon   the   town.
Unprofessional attitudes cannot be tolerated. Any breach of town policies, state and local laws, or departmental policies may result in disciplinary action . The seriousness of an offense will vary with the circumstances prevailing at the time it occurred and the behavior which prompted it and the employee's past record. All factors are considered when determining the appropriate action to take in a particular situation.

(2)	Disciplinary action will normally be imposed in the following order:

(a)	Verbal warning.

(b)	Written warning.

(c)	Suspension without pay.

(d)	Discharge.

(3)	This sequence of progressive discipline  need not  be followed  if an infraction ts sufficiently severe to merit skipping of one or more of the above steps.

B.	Procedure.

(1)	Verbal and written warnings will be given by the department head or Town Manager and shall include the nature of the offense, including the date and time of its occurrence, and remedial suggestions.

§ 138-41. Sexual harassment policy.

A.	Discussion.

(1)	The To'vvn of Plaistov1 is responsible for providing a variety of services to the community in the most efficient and businesslike manner possible. In order  to accomplish this goal, town government must provide the most businesslike work environment possible for its employees.
)	(2)  As in any workplace, the proper conduct of all employees is essential in creating this
environment, and great care should be used in all interpersonal relationships. An area of increasing concern is the problem of sexual harassment. On June 19, 1986, the United States Supreme Court ruled unanimously that sexual harassment is a form of discrimination covered by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended in 1972 to be applicable to all state and local governments (Vinson vs. Taylor).

B.	Sexual harassment. Sexual harassment may be defined as follows:

(1)	Any repeated or deliberate unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitutes sexual harassment when:

(a)	Submission to such conduct is made either implicitly or explicitly a term or condition of employment;

(b)	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual is used as a basis for employment decisions affecting such individual; or

(c)	Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive workplace.

(2) Sexual harassment is not limited to requests for sexual favors in return for job benefits. Sexual harassment may take the form of verbal abuse, leering, salacious gestures, inappropriate language , jok es of a sexual nature, or any undesired touching
)


13821
 
§ 138-41	PLAISTOW  CODE	§ 138-41

or patting. Such actions or other action shall be subject to rulings by the appropriate regulatory state or federal agency, prevailing law and/or legal rulings.

C. Guideline policy. It is the policy of this agency that all employees should be able to enjoy a working environment free from all forms of discrimination, including sexual harassment. Sexual harassment shall be treated as  an act of employee misconduct and will not be tolerated under any circumstances. This guideline is intended to cover employees, other town officials and consumers alike; it is not limited to incidents that occur between employees. It purposely covers employees' actions as they relate to the public,  whether they are the reporting party, victim, witness, or involved or noninvolved third party.

D.	Procedures. The Town of Plaistow recognizes that any  allegations of sexual harassment requires a determination of the facts in each case, and further recognizes that any such investigation should be conducted in a confidential manner until the allegation is properly reviewed. The following procedures should be considered in all circumstances when an individual feels that he/she is the victim of sexual harassment:

(1)	Often mediation is a timely and effective means of satisfying the complaint and resolving the situation. If agreed to by the complainant and the accused, mediation by an internal or external third party may be used as a form of either formal or informal resolution.

(2)	Information, counseling, and informal resolution.

(a)	Anyone may seek advice, information, or counseling on matters related to sexual harassment without having to lodge a formal complaint.

(b)	Persons who feel they are being harassed or who are uncertain if what they are experiencing is sexual harassment  are encouraged to talk with an advocate such as the department head, the Town Manager or an EAP representative.

(c)	At this stage of the informal resolution process, the person seeking information and  advice will be counseled  as to the options for action available under these guidelines.

(d)	To the extent possible, information disclosed through this advising process will be held in confidence, unless and until the initiating individual agrees that additional people must be informed in order to facilitate a solution.

(e)	The aim of informal complaint resolution is not to determine whether there was intent to harass but to ensure that the alleged offending behavior ceases and that the matter is resolved promptly at the appropriate level.

(f)	No disciplinary action is taken in resolving informal complaints.

(3)	To pursue an informal complaint speak to a supervisor, department head, Town Manager, Board of Selectmen, or EAP representative.

(4)	Formal complaint resolution.

(a)	Any individual who believes that he/she has been  sexually harassed shall file a written  complaint  of the incident to his/her immediate supervisor. An employee





13822
 
§ 138-41	PERSONNEL  PLAN	§ 138-42

or  other  individual  also  has  the  option  of  reporting  an  incident  to  the  Town Manager or to the Board of Selectmen.

(b)	Insofar as possible , the Town Manager shall conduct or cause to be conducted an investigation of the complaint and report the findings within 30 days.

(c)	The Town Manager shall notify the reporting employee of the findings of the investigation and of the corrective action, if any, to be taken with regard to the offending  employee.

(d)	Any corrective or disciplinary action taken shall be consistent with current town policy.

(e) In no case shall an employee reporting an incident  of  sexual  harassment  be subject to adverse employment action unless it is determined through the investigation that the allegation was not  based on fact and that the  employee made the allegation with malicious intent or knowing it was false.

(f) In all cases, aggrieved employees have the right to report any complaint to the State of New Hampshire Human Rights Commission, 163 Louden Road, Concord, New Hampshire, 03301, (603) 271-2767.

Full- and part-time employees of the Town of Plaistow can seek assistance from the Health Watch Employee Assistance Program (EAP) through self-referral, supervisor referral, and management consultation. Employees ' household members are also eligible to self-refer. Participation is entirely voluntary.

(1)	Any employee or household member is encouraged to self-refer to the EAP when assistance is needed. A call to the Health Watch EAP office will facilitate a private assessment in a timely manner.

(2)   The Town  of Plaistow  assures  every  employee  who uses  the Employee  Assistance
Program that his/her job status, compensation level, future promotions, and reputation	)
will not be harmed or jeopardized  as a result of that utilization. On the other hand this
policy does not replace existing management policy, disciplinary procedures, job standards, or contractual agreements regarding expectations of job performance.


§ 138-43. Alcohol- and drug-free workplace policy.

It is hereby established to be the policy of the Town of Plaistow to establish a drug-free workplace. The Town Manager or his/her designate will coordinate efforts which may include, but not necessarily be limited to, the following:

Wetlands

[Amended 3-13-2001 ATM by Art. P-32; 3-8-2005 ATM by Art. P-20; 3-14-2006 ATM by Art. P-6]

§ 220-18.  Authority and purpose.

By the authority granted in New Hampshire RSA 674:16 to 17 and RSA 674:20 to 21 and in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare, the Plaistow Wetlands Ordinance is hereby enacted to regulate the uses of a Wetlands District. The regulations are intended to:

A.	Protect persons and properties from danger of  floods by preserving natural floodwater storage areas.

B.	Prevent the Town of Plaistow from incurring the costs of constructing sewer lines and treatment facilities which will be necessitated by the unwise use or development of unsuitable areas.

C.	Prevent development on soils which will contribute to the pollution of surface and ground waters necessary to supply domestic needs.

D.	Preserve recharge areas necessary to regulate groundwater supply and augment stream flow during dry periods.

E.	Protect existing water quality.

F.	Protect existing natural wildlife habitats.

G.	Discourage chronic stress on wetlands environments contributed by modification of water flow patterns and rates.

H.	Encourage uses that can be safely and appropriately located in wetland areas.

I.	Encourage uses that can be safely and appropriately located in green spaces and open spaces.

§ 220-19.  Wetlands District.

A.	A Wetlands District is an overlay district that may occur in any zone as defined by the Plaistow Zoning Ordinance.

B.	A Wetlands District contains all wetlands areas as defined in § 220-20B and all wetlands buffers as defined in § 220-21.

C.	Where a Wetlands District overlays another zone or district the more restrictive regulations shall apply.

§ 220-20. Wetlands and wetlands boundaries.

A.	"Wetlands" means an area that is inundated or saturated by surface water or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and that under normal conditions does support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions.

B.	The wetlands boundary shall circumscribe the wetlands area as defined in Subsection A.

C.	Saturated  soil  conditions  shall  be  as  defined  by the  High  Intensity Soil  Survey (HIS)
 

Standards. The HIS standards define soil types by six drainage classes; two of those classes, 5 and 6, define saturated soil conditions. Class 5 soils are poorly drained soils, and Class 6 soils are very poorly drained soils. All soil surveys for determining saturated soil conditions shall be performed in adherence with HIS standards.

D.	Vernal pools shall be considered wetlands areas for the purpose of this article. Vernal pools have either bedrock or a hard clay layer in the soil that helps to keep water in the pool. They are covered by shallow water for variable periods from winter to spring but may be completely dry for most of the summer and fall.

E.	Wetlands vegetation shall be defined as vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Areas where wetland vegetation comprises 50% or more of the total vegetation shall be considered wetlands regardless of soil classification boundaries.

§ 220-21. Wetlands buffers.

Wetland buffers shall exist adjacent to all wetlands areas to protect wetlands and the surrounding vegetation and wildlife habitats. Wetlands buffers shall include the following:

A.	No-cut, no-disturb buffer.

(1)	There shall be a twenty-five-foot buffer immediately adjacent to all wetlands areas that shall be left in its naturally vegetated state. No cutting of vegetation shall be permitted unless a study (approved by the Planning Board and Conservation Commission) is done that shows the existing vegetation as having a negative impact on the wetlands areas, vegetation or wildlife supported by the wetlands areas.

(2)	No additional plantings are allowed, and no fertilizers, herbicides, or pesticides may be applied in wetlands buffers. Town, state, and federal regulated mosquito and pest control is exempt from this restriction.

B.	Twenty-five-foot no construction buffer.

(1)	There shall be a twenty-five-foot buffer immediately adjacent to the "no-cut, no- disturb" buffer (total of 50 feet from the outer edge of the wetlands boundary as determined herein). No buildings, structures, driveways, roads, or paved surfaces are allowed in the twenty-five-foot no-construction buffer.

(2)	This buffer shall apply only in those cases where the wetlands areas are defined by poorly drained soils and/or by wetlands vegetation.

C.	Fifty-foot no-construction buffer.

(1)	There shall be a fifty-foot buffer immediately adjacent to the "no-cut, no-disturb" buffer (total of 75 feet from the outer edge of the buffer to the wetlands boundary). No buildings, structures, driveways, roads, or paved surfaces are allowed in the fifty-foot no-construction buffer.

(2)	This buffer shall apply only in those cases where the wetlands areas are defined by very poorly drained soils and/or by vernal pools.

D.	Wetlands buffers diagram.
 


 


§ 220-22.  Boundary appeals.

In the event that the Code Enforcement Officer, the Conservation Commission, or the Planning Board questions the validity of a wetlands boundary, or a wetlands buffer on a specific parcel of land, the Board may call upon the services of a qualified wetlands scientist, biologist, or botanist, as applicable, to examine and report the findings to the Planning Board and Conservation Commission for determination of the boundary. Any necessary soil testing procedures or vegetation determination procedures shall be conducted at the expense of the applicant. Any costs associated with such an appeal shall be borne by the applicant.

§ 220-23.  Permitted uses in Wetlands District.

All uses not specifically mentioned in this article are not permitted. Permitted uses are those compatible with the purposes specified in § 220-18 of this article, those in compliance with other municipal and state regulations, and those which do not involve significant altering of the wetlands, including:

A.	Forestry and tree farming in accordance with a certified professional forester.

B.	Water supply sources.

C.	Wildlife habitat and habitat development.

D.	Conservation areas, passive recreational uses, and nature trails, providing the activity has not significantly altered any part of the district or wildlife habitat.

E.	Agriculture, including grazing, hay production, truck gardening, and silage production, providing that such uses are shown not to cause increases in surface or groundwater contamination by pesticides or other toxic or hazardous substances and that such uses will not cause the soil to erode.

§ 220-24. Prohibitions in Wetlands District.

The following prohibitions apply in a Wetlands District:

A.	Septic systems and waste disposal systems. [Amended 3-11-2008 ATM by Art. P-08-20]

(1)	Septic systems or waste disposal systems are not allowed.

§ 220-25.  Conditional uses.

A.	A conditional use permit may be granted by the Planning Board (RSA 674:21, II) for the construction of roads and other access ways and for pipelines, power lines, and other types of transmission lines, provided the following conditions are met:

(1)	The proposed construction is essential to the productive use of land not within a Wetlands District.

(2)	Design and construction methods will be such as to minimize detrimental impact upon a Wetlands District and will include restoration of the site as nearly as possible to its original grade and condition.

(3)	No feasible alternative route that avoids crossing a Wetlands District or has less detrimental impact on a Wetlands District is feasible.

(4)	Economic advantage alone is not the reason for the proposed construction.

(5)	A written report from the Conservation Commission regarding the conditional use permit is received by the Planning Board.

B.	Prior to the granting of a conditional permit under this section, the applicant shall agree to submit a performance security as determined by the Planning Board. The security shall be submitted in a form and amount with surety and conditions satisfactory to the Planning Board to ensure that the construction has been carried out in accordance with the approved design. The security shall be submitted and approved by the Planning Board prior to the issuance of any permit authorizing construction.

C.	The Planning Board, with the concurrence of the Conservation Commission, may require the applicant to submit an environmental impact assessment when necessary to evaluate an application made under this section. The cost of this assessment shall be borne by the applicant. The Planning Board may also assess the applicant reasonable fees to cover the costs of other special investigative studies and for the review of documents required by particular applications.

§ 220-26.  Septic systems and waste disposal systems. [Added 3-11-2008 ATM by Art. P-08-21]

§ 220-32. District objectives and land use control.

The following tables set forth the objectives of each of the districts hereby established and the provisions of the regulations that apply respectively in each district. Any use designated as a "Permitted Use" in a particular district may be commenced in such district pursuant to § 220-33 of this chapter. Any use designated as a "Special Exception" in a particular district may be commenced in such district pursuant to § 220-138 of this chapter. Regulations for lots, classification of lots, dimension requirements, accessory uses and application of district regulations are found in §§ 220-32 to 220-45, inclusive. The raising of legal crops, keeping of gardens, and using of land for forestry are allowed in all districts and are not regulated by this chapter.
 

Table 220-32A "INDI" - Industrial I

A.	Objectives and characteristics. The purpose of this district is to provide locations for the establishment of plants to improve employment opportunities and broaden the tax base in the community. These areas should be selected so that they will not adversely affect developed residential areas, will have good access to transportation facilities, and will have the potential for being served by public water and sewer systems. A variety of types of manufacturing activities, distribution facilities, and offices should be permitted, as well as certain support facilities, especially of a commercial nature.

One of the major characteristics of this zone is its proximity to the rail line that carries both freight and passenger service and should favor those industries that are able to take advantage of the rail connection. The zone is also surrounded by residential uses and in general does not have good access to a major thoroughfare such as Route 125. These areas are extremely traffic sensitive and noise and dust issues will be of paramount importance. Any proposed use must not violate §220-5., Prohibited Uses. [Amended 3-10-2009 ATM by Art. P-09-26]

§ 220-55.1.  Purpose; applicability.

This overlay district has been established as a method for managing access and applies to the C1 and Industrial Zoning Districts and provides for a special set of requirements. The purpose of this overlay district is to provide for the orderly development/redevelopment of the state roadways in these zoning districts. Prospective developers of properties along the corridors should be required to incorporate and construct the appropriate components of the following specifications into their development plans.

§ 220-55.2.  General requirements.

The underlying zoning and its associated requirements are retained and must be referred to in addition to the following set of requirements:

A.	The minimum building setback shall be 50 feet from the front property line. Undeveloped front yards are required to be no less than 12 feet in width. [Amended 3-9-2004 ATM by Art. P-33; P-45; 3-8-2005 ATM by Art. P-3; 3-9-2010 ATM by Art. P-10-Q]

(2)	The minimum lot size and the minimum road frontage should be reduced by a total of 20% if the entire site is accessed by a single shared driveway with an adjacent site on a roadway other than the state roadways, and which is appropriately zoned for the use.

I.	Interconnecting driveways. All projects shall provide interconnecting driveways or easements for future construction of driveways that will provide and promote vehicular and pedestrian access between adjacent lots, without accessing the state roadway to all property lines, and should be designed to provide safe and controlled access to adjacent developments where they exist.

J.	Access to lots with multiple frontage. Lots with frontage on both the state roadway and an adjacent or intersecting road are not permitted to access the state roadway, except where it can be proven that other potential access points would cause greater environmental or traffic impacts.

K.	Driveway throat length. The minimum length of a driveway should be of adequate length to accommodate the queuing of the maximum number of vehicles, as defined by the peak period of operation identified in the traffic study.

L.	Adequate on-site circulation and storage. Adequate number of parking spaces, aisle widths, raised medians and tractor-trailer access shall be provided in order to promote safe and efficient movement into and out of the site.

G.	Prior to removal of topsoil or other material from a new excavation area, the excavator shall file a reclamation bond or other security as prescribed by the Planning Board sufficient to secure the reclamation of the site.
 

§ 220-74.  Reclamation standards.

A.	Within 12 months after the expiration date of a permit or of the completion of any excavation, whether subject to permit or not, and timed according to whichever occurs first, the owner of the excavated land shall have completed the reclamation of the areas affected by the excavation by fulfilling the following minimum requirements in accordance with RSA 155-E:5 and this article:

(1)	Except for exposed rock ledge, all areas affected by the excavation or stripped of vegetation shall be spread with soil capable of sustaining vegetation; shall be seeded with grass or other plant life suitable to prevent erosion; and shall be replanted with tree seedlings wherever trees which were visible from a public way have been removed. Such activity shall be in accordance with acceptable horticultural practices.
(2)	Earth and vegetative debris resulting from the excavation shall be removed or otherwise be lawfully disposed of.
(3)	All slopes, except exposed ledge, shall be graded to natural contours for the soil type of which they are composed and shall not be left steeper than 2:1. Slope changes shall not be abrupt but shall blend with surrounding terrain.
(4)	Any standing bodies of water as may constitute a hazard to health and safety shall be eliminated.
(5)	The topography of the land shall be left so that water draining from the site flows from the property at the original, natural drainage points and in natural proportions. Whenever a permit from the Division of Water Supply and Pollution Control is issued,
pursuant  to  RSA  149:8-a,47  the  provisions  of  that  statute  shall  supersede  this subsection.
B.	Any excavated area of five contiguous acres or more which is either depleted of commercial earth materials, excluding bedrock, or from which no earth materials have been removed for
a two-year period shall be reclaimed in accordance with RSA 155-E:5 and this article. Reclamation shall take place within 12 months following such depletion or two years of nonuse, regardless of whether other excavation is occurring on adjacent land in contiguous ownership.

C.	Exceptions. The Planning Board, upon application and following a hearing in accordance with § 220-76 of this article, may grant an exception in writing to the standards contained in this section (§ 220-74) and § 220-73 above if good cause can be shown. A written decision shall state the specific standards, if any, which are being relaxed and shall include reasonable alternative standards. The Planning Board's decision on any request for exception may be appealed in accordance with RSA 155-E:9.

§ 220-75.  Application for amendment.

When the scope of a project for which an excavation permit has been issued is proposed to be altered so as to affect the size or location of the excavation, or the rate of removal, or the plan for reclamation, the owner shall submit an application for amendment of the excavation permit, said application for amendment to be subject to approval in the same manner as an initial application for excavation.




47.	Editor's Note: RSA 149:8-a was repealed by 1989, 339:35, IV. See now RSA 485-A:17.

START OF CONSTRUCTION — Includes substantial improvements and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, placement, or other improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation, or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory uses or structures, such as garages or sheds, not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure.

STRUCTURE — For floodplain management purposes, a walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally above ground, as well as a manufactured home.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT — Any combination of repairs, reconstruction, alteration, or improvements to a structure in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure. The market value of the structure should equal the appraised value prior to the start of the initial repair or improvement or, in the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure. This term includes structures which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include any project for improvement of a structure required to comply with existing health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions or any alteration of an historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure.

WATER SURFACE ELEVATION — The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum, where specified), of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains.

§ 220-82.  General provisions.

A.	All proposed development in any special flood hazard areas shall require a building permit.

B.	The Building Inspector shall review all building permit applications for new construction or substantial improvements to determine whether proposed building sites will be reasonably safe from flooding. If a proposed building site is located in a special flood hazard area, all new construction or substantial improvements shall:

(1)	Be designed (or modified) and adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy.

(2)	Be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage.

(3)	Be constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damages.

(4)	Be constructed with electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air-conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding.

C.	Where new or replacement water and sewer systems (including on-site systems) are proposed in a special flood hazard area the applicant shall provide the Building Inspector with assurance that these systems will be designed to minimize or eliminate infiltration of floodwaters into the systems and discharges from the systems into floodwaters, and on-site waste disposal systems will be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during periods of flooding.

D.	For all new or substantially improved structures located in Zone A, A1-30, AE, AO or AH, the applicant shall furnish the following information to the Conservation Commission and the Town Engineer:

(1)	The as-built elevation (in relation to NGVD) of the lowest floor (including basement)
 

and include whether or not such structures contain a basement.

(2)	If the structure has been floodproofed, the as-built elevation (in relation to NGVD) to which the structure was floodproofed.

(3)	Any certification of floodproofing. The Conservation Commission and the Town Engineer shall maintain for public inspection and shall furnish such information upon request.

E.	The Building inspector shall not grant a building permit until the applicant certifies that all necessary permits have been received from those governmental agencies from which approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, Amendments of 1972, 33 U.S.C. § 1334.

§ 220-83.  Wetlands provision.

A.	In riverine situation, prior to the alteration or relocation of a watercourse, the applicant for such authorization shall notify the Wetlands Board of the New Hampshire Environmental Services Department and submit copies of such notification to the Planning Board, in addition to the copies required by the RSA 482-A:3. Further, the applicant shall be required to submit copies of said notification to those adjacent communities as determined by the Planning Board, including notice of all scheduled hearings before the Wetlands Board.

B.	The applicant shall submit to the Planning Board certification provided by a registered professional engineer assuring that the flood-carrying capacity of an altered or relocated watercourse can and will be maintained.

C.	Along watercourses with a designated regulatory floodway no encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, are allowed within the floodway that would result in any increase in flood levels within the community during the base flood discharge. In Zone A, the Town Engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any floodway data available from federal, state, or other sources as criteria for requiring that development meet the floodway requirements of this section.

D.	Along watercourses that have not had a regulatory floodway designated, no new construction, substantial improvements, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE on the FIRM, unless it is demonstrated by the applicant that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all existing and anticipated development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the community.

§ 220-84. Flood hazard areas.

A.	In special flood hazard areas, the Town Engineer shall determine the one-hundred-year flood elevation in the following order of precedence according to the data available:

(1)	In Zones A1-30, AH, AE, V1-30, and VE refer to the elevation data provided in the community's Flood Insurance Study and accompanying FIRM or FHBM.

(2)	In unnumbered A Zones the Town Engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any one-hundred-year flood elevation data available from any federal, state or other source, including data submitted for development proposals submitted to the community (i.e., subdivisions and site approvals).
 

(3)	In Zone AO the flood elevation is determined by adding the elevation of the highest adjacent grade to the depth number specified on the FIRM or, if no depth number is specified on the FIRM, at least two feet.

B.	The  Town  Engineer's  one-hundred-year  flood  elevation  determination  will  be  used  as criteria for requiring in Zones A, A1-30, AE, AH, AO, and A that:

(1)	All new construction or substantial improvement of residential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the one-hundred-year flood elevation;

(2)	All new construction or substantial improvements of nonresidential structures have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated to or above the one-hundred-year flood level or, together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

(a)	Be floodproofed so that below the one-hundred-year flood elevation the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

(b)	Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effects of buoyancy; and

(c)	Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the design and methods of construction are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the provisions of this section.

(3)	All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within special flood hazard areas shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood level and shall be securely anchored to resist flotation, collapse, or lateral movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces.

(4)	Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE shall either:

(a)	Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days;

(b)	Be fully licensed and ready for highway use; or

(c)	Meet all standards of Section 60:3(b)(1) of the National Flood Insurance Program regulations and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Subsection B(3) of this section.

(5)	For all new construction and substantial improvements, fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding are permitted provided they meet the following requirements:

(a)	The enclosed area is unfinished or flood-resistant, usable solely for the parking of vehicles, building access or storage;

(b)	The area is not a basement; and

(c)	The area shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for
 

meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect or must meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

(1)	A minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided.

(2)	The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade.

(6)	Proposed structures to be located on slopes in special flood hazard areas, Zones AH and AO, shall include adequate drainage paths to guide floodwaters around and away from the proposed structures.

§ 220-85.  Variances and appeals.

A.	Any order, requirement, decision or determination of the Town Engineer made under this article may be appealed to the Zoning Board of Adjustment as set forth in RSA 676:5.

B.	If the applicant, upon appeal, requests a variance as authorized by RSA 674:33, I(b), the applicant shall have the burden of showing, in addition to the usual variance standards under state law, that:

(1)	The variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense.

(2)	If the requested variance is for activity within a designated regulatory floodway, no increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge will result.

(3)	The variance is necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

C.	The Zoning Board of Adjustment shall notify the applicant in writing that:

(1)	The issuance of a variance to construct below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage.

Impact Fees
[Amended 3-9-2004 ATM by Art. P-3050; 3-13-18 ATM by Art. Z-18-14]

§ 220-90.  Statutory authority; purpose.

Impact fees assessed by the Town of Plaistow are permitted under RSA 674:21, V, as an innovative land use control. Impact fees collected from each new development help offset the cost of capital facilities required by the Town of Plaistow to insure the health and safety of its residents. Impact fees are assessed and collected for the Timberlane School District to help offset the capital facility costs of the school district that serves Plaistow students.

§ 220-90.1. Definitions.

1.	New Development.  As associated with the administration of impact fees, means and activity that results in:
a.	The creation of a new dwelling unit or units; or
b.	The creation of a new accessory dwelling unit with square footage outside of a primary dwelling unit; or
c.	The conversion of a lawfully existing use, or additions thereto, that would result in a net
increase in the number of dwelling units; or
d.	The construction of new non-residential buildings or additions thereto; or
e.	The conversion of a building that results in a net increase in the gross floor area of a non- residential use; or
f.	Subdivision and site plans for the purpose of assessing an impact fee

§ 220-91. Imposition of impact fees.

New development and expansion of existing developments are required to pay impact fees as described by § 220-100 of this article and as maintained in the Plaistow Planning Board Fee Schedule that shall be adopted by the Plaistow Planning Board after notice and public hearing. Payment of such fees does not preclude the Town or the Planning Board from requiring other payments for facilities specifically benefiting the development as required by the subdivision or site plan review regulations.

§ 220-92.  Computation of impact fees.

Each impact described in § 220-100 shall have its own impact fee calculation, and such calculation shall be based on a methodology such that each person seeking new or expanded development pays a proportionate, fair-share amount of the capital facilities. The methodologies shall be incorporated into the Plaistow Planning Board Fee Schedule and may be amended, as Plaistow’s needs arise, at a Public Hearing held during a regular or special meeting of the Planning Board.

A.	At such time that a small wind energy system is scheduled to be abandoned or discontinued, the applicant will notify the building inspector by certified U.S. mail of the proposed date of abandonment or discontinuation of operations

B.	Upon abandonment or discontinuation of use, the owner shall physically remove the small wind energy system within 90 days from the date of abandonment or discontinuation of use. This period may be extended at the request of the owner and at the discretion of the building inspector. “Physically remove” shall include, but not be limited to:

(1)	Removal of the wind generator and tower and related above-grade structures.

(2)	Restoration of the location of the small wind energy system to its natural condition, except that any landscaping, grading or below-grade foundation may remain in its same condition at initiation of abandonment.

C.	In the event that an applicant fails to give such notice, the system shall be considered abandoned or discontinued if the system is out-of-service for a continuous 12-month period. After the 12 months of inoperability, the building inspector may issue a Notice of Abandonment to the owner of the small wind energy system. The owner shall have the right to respond to the Notice of Abandonment within 30 days from Notice receipt date. After review of the information provided by the owner, the building inspector shall determine if the small wind energy system has been abandoned. If it is determined that the small wind energy system has not been abandoned, the building inspector shall withdraw the Notice of Abandonment and notify the owner of the withdrawal.
 

D.	If the owner fails to respond to the Notice of Abandonment or if, after review by the building inspector, it is determined that the small wind energy system has been abandoned or discontinued, the owner of the small wind energy system shall remove the wind generator and tower at the owner’s sole expense within 3 months of receipt of the Notice of Abandonment.

§ 220-111. Discharge prohibitions.

A.	Prohibition of Illegal Discharges.
 

No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than storm water.

The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows:

(1)	The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this ordinance: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wet-land flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated - typically less than one PPM chlorine), fire fighting activities, and any other water source not containing Pollutants.

(2)	Discharges specified in writing by the Town of Plaistow as being necessary to protect public health and safety.

(3)	Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the Town of Plaistow prior to the time of the test.

(4)	The prohibition shall not apply to any non-storm water discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that written approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system.

B.	Prohibition of Illicit Connections.

The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the storm drain system is prohibited.

(1)	This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection.

(2)	A person is considered to be in violation of this ordinance if the person connects a line conveying sewage to the MS4, or allows such a connection to continue.

220-112.  Suspension of MS4 access.

A.	Suspension due to Illicit Discharges in Emergency Situations
The Town of Plaistow may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present  imminent  and substantial  danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of
 

persons, or to the MS4 or Waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the Town of Plaistow may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.

B.	Suspension due to the Detection of Illicit Discharge
Any person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this ordinance may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The Town of Plaistow will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the Town of Plaistow for a reconsideration and hearing.

C.	A person commits an offense if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this Section, without the prior approval of the Town of Plaistow.


§ 220-113.  Industrial or construction activity discharges.

Any person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the Town of Plaistow prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4.

§ 220-114.  Monitoring of discharges.

A.	Applicability.

This section applies to all facilities that have storm water discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity.

B.	Access to Facilities.

(1)	The Town of Plaistow shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this ordinance as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this ordinance. If a discharger has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the Town of Plaistow.

(2)	Facility operators shall allow the Town of Plaistow ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.

(3)	The Town of Plaistow shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the Town of Plaistow to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's storm water discharge.

(4)	The Town of Plaistow has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its
 

own expense. All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.

(5)	Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the Town of Plaistow and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator.

(6)	Unreasonable delays in allowing the Town of Plaistow access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge permit and of this ordinance. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the Town of Plaistow reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this ordinance.

(7)	If the Town of Plaistow has been refused access to any part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this ordinance, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this ordinance or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the Town of Plaistow may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.

§ 220-115. Requirement to prevent, control, and reduce storm water pollutants by the use of Best Management Practices.

The Town of Plaistow will adopt requirements identifying Best Management Practices for any Town activity, operation, or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of storm water, the storm drain system, or waters of the U.S. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non- structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.

j.	Naturally occurring streams, channels, and wetlands shall be used for conveyance of runoff leaving the project area only after appropriate sedimentation control measures have been employed.

2.	Permanent Stormwater Management Design Criteria

The following standards shall be applied in planning for stormwater management and erosion control as related to long-term management of municipal water quality:

a.	Under One Acre of Disturbance:
1.	Within the urbanized area (UA) will require a basic stormwater quality management system. At a minimum, all stormwater must pass through basic pretreatment (beyond catch basin sumps) prior to leaving the site.

b.	Over One (1) Acre Disturbance:
1.	Within the UA requires a well thought out, systematic permanent stormwater quality management system. Latest technology and most up-to-date performance data must be considered when selecting permanent control measures. As noted above, catch basin sumps alone are not considered a valid water control measure. Mechanical devices may be required to supplement any proposal. Maintenance programs and schedules will be required as part of the proposal. Off-site water quality control measures may require long-term escrow funds to cover future maintenance expenses. Sites with appropriate separation to the seasonal high groundwater table must also consider groundwater recharge. All groundwater recharge systems will require on-site test pit and percolation test data to be submitted as part of the review.
2.	Outside the UA requires a basic systematic permanent stormwater quality management system. Catch basin sumps alone are not considered a valid water quality control measure.
c.	Adjacent to the Wetlands Buffer (Any Size Disturbance):

1.	Any new project adjacent to the wetlands buffer will require permanent water quality control measures.
2.	Projects involving redevelopment or expansion will be considered on a case-by-case basis.

d.	Municipal Project: All municipal projects will also consider inclusion of water quality control measures.
 

3.	Permanent Stormwater Management Technical Design Criteria

a.	All measures in the plan shall meet as a minimum the Best Management Practices set forth in the “Stormwater Management and Erosion and Sediment Control Handbook for Urban and Developing Areas in New Hampshire,” Rockingham County Conservation District, NH Department of Environmental Services, Soil Conservation Service (now the Natural Resources Conservation Service), August 1992, as amended from time to time.

b.	The design of proposed features must consider the following:

1)	Existing and proposed methods of handling stormwater runoff so that there will be no increase in the amount of runoff that leaves the boundaries of the site. (The Planning Board may permit an increase in off-site stormwater runoff on submission of a detailed downstream, study and on the recommendation of the Town.)
2)	Engineering calculations used to determine drainage requirements based upon 25-year storm frequency, 24-hour duration shall be provided if the project will significantly alter the existing drainage patterns due to such factors as the amount of new impervious surfaces (such as pavement and building areas) being proposed. Closed drainage features must be sized for the 10-year storm frequency. Culverts, major ditches, swales, and detention facilities must be sized for the 25-year storm frequency.
3)	If the project will affect drainage flow to an existing roadway culvert, or if a detention or retention pond is proposed, a minimum of a 25-year storm shall be used to evaluate potential off-site effects. If a State owned or maintained culvert is affected by the development, State of New Hampshire Department of Transportation Guidelines shall be used for evaluation of the culvert.
4)	All temporary erosion and sediment control measures shall be removed after final site stabilization. Trapped sediment and other disturbed soil areas resulting from the removal of temporary measures shall be permanently stabilized within thirty (30) days.
5)	Velocities of less than ten (10) feet per second are required prior to entering a sedimentation swale. The maximum design velocity within the swale shall be 1.0 feet per second during passage of the 10-year storm.
6)	Flows of less than ten (10) cubic feet per second are required prior to entering a sedimentation swale.
7)	All slopes equal to or steeper than 2:1 adjacent to a public right-of-way must have special stabilization details provided with the submission.
8)	Velocities of ten (10) feet per second or less are desirable within a closed drainage system. Higher velocities may be allowed provided special design criteria have been used.

The  following  shall  be  required  in  the  final  plan  unless  the  project  is  deemed  of sufficiently minimal impact.

4.	Construction Drawings/Supporting Documents Shall Include the Following:
a.	Locus map showing property boundaries

(5)	Towers shall not contain any permanent or temporary signs, writing, symbols, or any graphic representation of any kind.

B.	Federal requirements. All towers must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, FCC, and any other agency of the federal government with the authority to regulate towers and antennas. If such standards and regulations are changed, then  the owners of the towers and antennas governed by this article shall bring such towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations within six months of the effective date of such standards and regulations, unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. Failure to bring towers and antennas into compliance with such revised standards and regulations shall constitute grounds for the removal, in accordance with § 220-127, of the tower or antenna, as abandoned, at the owner's expense through the execution of the posted security.

C.	Building codes; safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of towers and antennas, the owner of a tower shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with standards contained in applicable local building codes55 and the applicable standards for towers that are published by the Electronic Industries Association, as amended from time to time. If, upon inspection, the Town concludes that a tower fails to comply with such codes and standards and constitutes a danger to persons or property, then, upon notice being provided to the owner of the tower, the owner shall have 30 days to bring such tower into compliance with such standards. If the owner fails to bring such tower into compliance within 30 days, such action shall constitute an abandonment and grounds for the removal, in accordance with § 220-127, of the tower or antenna, as abandoned, at the owner's expense through execution of the posted security.

D.	Additional requirements for telecommunications facilities. These requirements shall supersede any and all other applicable standards found elsewhere in Town ordinances or regulations that are less strict.

(1)	Setbacks and separation.

(a)	Towers must be set back a distance equal to 125% of the height of the tower from any off-site residential structure.



55.	Editor's Note: See Ch. 31, Building Construction.
 

(b)	Tower, guys, and accessory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district setback requirements.

(c)	Towers over 90 feet in height shall not be located within 1/4 mile of any existing tower that is over 90 feet in height.

(2)	Security fencing. Towers shall be enclosed by security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall also be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device.

(3)	Landscaping.

(a)	Towers shall be landscaped with a buffer of plant materials that effectively screens the view of the tower compound from adjacent residential property. The standard buffer shall consist of a landscaped strip at least 10 feet wide outside the perimeter of the compound. Natural vegetation is preferred.

(b)	In locations where the visual impact of the tower would be minimal, the landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived entirely.

(c)	Existing mature tree growth and natural land forms on the site shall be preserved to the maximum extent possible. In some cases, such as towers sited on large wooded lots, natural growth around the property may be deemed a sufficient buffer.

§ 220-124.  Conditional use permits.

A.	General. All applicants under this article shall apply to the Planning Board for site plan review, in accordance with the requirements as provided for in the town's site plan review regulations.56 In addition, applicants under this article shall also be required to submit the information provided for in this section.

B.	Issuance of conditional use permits. In granting the conditional use permit, the Planning Board may impose conditions to the extent the Board concludes such conditions are necessary to minimize any adverse effect of the proposed tower on adjoining properties and preserve the intent of this article.

(1)	Procedure on application. The Planning Board shall act upon the application in accordance with the procedural requirements of the site plan review regulations and RSA 676:4.

(2)	Decisions. Possible decisions rendered by the Planning Board include approval, approval with conditions, or denial. All decisions shall be rendered in writing, and a denial shall be in writing and based upon substantial evidence contained in the written record.

(3)	Factors considered in granting decisions:

(a)	Height of proposed tower or other structure.

(b)	Proximity of tower to residential development or zones.

(c)	Nature of uses on adjacent and nearby properties.


56.	Editor's Note: See Ch. 230, Site Plan Review.
 

(d)	Surrounding topography.

(e)	Surrounding tree coverage and foliage.

(f)	Design of the tower, with particular reference to design characteristics that have the effect of reducing or eliminating visual obtrusiveness.

(g)	Proposed ingress and egress to the site.

(h)	Availability of suitable existing towers and other structures as discussed in § 220-121.

(i)	Visual impacts on viewsheds, ridgelines, and other impacts by means of tower location, tree and foliage clearing and placement of incidental structures.

(j)	Availability of alternative tower structures and alternative siting locations.

C.	Information required. Each applicant requesting a conditional use permit under this article shall submit a scaled plan in accordance with the site plan review regulations and further information, including a scaled elevation view, topography, radio frequency coverage, tower height requirements, setbacks, drives, parking, fencing, landscaping, adjacent uses (up to 200 feet away), and any other information deemed necessary by the Planning Board to assess compliance with this article. Furthermore, the applicant shall submit the following prior to any approval by the Board:

(1)	The applicant shall submit written proof that the proposed use/facility complies with the FCC regulations on radio frequency (RF) exposure guidelines.

(2)	The applicant shall submit written proof that an evaluation has taken place, as well as the results of such evaluation, satisfying the requirements of the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) further referenced in applicable FCC rules. If an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmental impact statement (EIS) is required under the FCC rules and NEPA, submission of the EA or EIS to the Board prior to the beginning of the federal thirty-day comment period, and the Town process, shall become part of the application requirements.

(3)	Each applicant for an antenna and/or tower shall provide to the Planning Board an inventory of its existing towers that are within the jurisdiction of the Town and those within two miles of the border thereof, including specific information about the location, height, and design of each tower, as well as economic and technological feasibility for co-location on the inventoried towers. The Planning Board may share such information with other applicants applying for approvals or conditional use permits under this article or other organizations seeking to locate antennas within the jurisdiction of the governing authority, provided, however that the Planning Board is not, by sharing such information, in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable. If the applicant is proposing to build a new tower, the applicant shall submit written evidence demonstrating that no existing structure can accommodate the applicant's proposed antenna. This evidence can consist of:

(a)	Substantial evidence that no existing towers or structures are located within the geographic area required to meet the applicant's engineering requirements, provided that a description of the geographic area required is also submitted.
 

(b)	Substantial evidence that existing towers are not of sufficient height to meet the applicant's engineering requirements, and why.

(c)	Substantial evidence that the existing towers or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment.

(d)	Substantial evidence that applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antenna on the existing towers or structures, or the antenna on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna.

(e)	Substantial evidence that the fees, costs, or contractual provisions required by the owner in order to share the existing tower or structure are unreasonable. Costs exceeding new tower development are presumed to be unreasonable.

(f)	Substantial evidence that the applicant can demonstrate other limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable.

(4)	The applicant proposing to build a new tower shall submit an agreement with the Town that allows for the maximum allowance of co-location upon the new structure. Such statement shall become a condition to any approval. This statement shall, at a minimum, require the applicant to supply available co-location for reasonable fees and costs to other telecommunications providers. Failure to provide such an agreement is evidence of the applicant's unwillingness to cooperate with the orderly and well- planned development of the Town of Plaistow, and grounds for a denial.

(5)	The applicant shall submit the engineering information detailing the size and coverage required for the facility location. The Planning Board may have this information reviewed by a consultant for verification of any claims made by the applicant regarding technological limitations and feasibility for alternative locations. Cost for this review shall be borne by the applicant in accordance with RSA 676:4, I(g).

§ 220-125.  Waivers.

A.	General. Where the Board finds that extraordinary hardships, practical difficulties, or unnecessary and unreasonable expense would result from strict compliance with the foregoing regulations or the purposes of these regulations may be served to a greater extent by an alternative proposal, it may approve waivers to these regulations. The purpose of granting waivers under provisions of these regulations shall be to ensure that an applicant is not unduly burdened as opposed to merely inconvenienced by said regulations. The Board shall not approve any waiver(s) unless a majority of those present and voting shall find that all of the following apply:

(1)	The granting of the waiver will not be detrimental to the public safety, health or welfare or injurious to other property and will promote the public interest.

(2)	The waiver will not, in any manner, vary the provisions of the Plaistow Zoning Ordinance, Plaistow Master Plan, or Official Maps.

(3)	Such waiver(s) will substantially secure the objectives, standards and requirements of these regulations.
 

(4)	A particular and identifiable hardship exists or a specific circumstance warrants the granting of a waiver. Factors to be considered in determining the existence of a hardship shall include, but not be limited to:

(a)	Topography and other site features.

(b)	Availability of alternative site locations.

(c)	Geographic location of property.

(d)	Size/magnitude of project being evaluated and availability of co-location.

B.	Conditions. In approving waivers, the Board may impose such conditions as it deems appropriate to substantially secure the objectives of the standards or requirements of these regulations.
C.	Procedures. A petition for any such waiver shall be submitted in writing by the applicant with the application for Board review. The petition shall state fully the grounds for the waiver and all of the facts relied upon by the applicant. Failure to submit petition in writing shall require an automatic denial.

§ 220-126. Bonding and security and insurance.
Recognizing the extremely hazardous situation presented by abandoned and unmonitored towers, the Planning Board shall set the form and amount of security that represents the cost for removal and disposal of abandoned towers in the event that the tower is abandoned and the tower owner is incapable and unwilling to remove the tower in accordance with § 220-127. Bonding and surety
shall be consistent with the provision in the subdivision regulations.57 Furthermore, the Planning Board shall require the submission of proof of adequate insurance covering accident or damage.

§ 220-127.  Removal of abandoned antennas and towers.
Any antenna or tower that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned and hazardous to the public health and safety, unless the owner of said tower provides proof of quarterly inspections. The owner shall remove the abandoned structure within 90 days of receipt of a declaration of abandonment from the Town notifying the owner of such abandonment. A declaration of abandonment shall only be issued following a public hearing, noticed per Town regulations, with notice to abutters and the last known owner/operator of the tower. If the abandoned tower is not removed within 90 days the Town may execute the security and have the tower removed. If there are two or more users of a single tower, this provision shall not become effective until all users cease using the tower.

§ 220-132.  District boundaries.

A.	Location.

(1)	The Aquifer Protection District is defined as the areas shown on the map titled "Saturated Thickness and Transmissivity of Stratified Drift in the Lower Merrimack and Coastal River Basins, Southeastern New Hampshire" that was produced by the United States Geological Survey and is included in the report "Geohydrology and Water Quality of Stratified Aquifers in the Lower Merrimack and Coastal River Basins, Southeastern New Hampshire, 1990." Said map is hereby adopted as part of the Official Zoning Map of the Town of Plaistow.

(2)	The Aquifer Protection District as shown on the Town of Plaistow’s Aquifer Protection District Map (2005) includes the areas containing the following aquifer materials: Coarse Grained Stratified and Coarse Grained overlaying Fine Grained Materials. (Amended ATM 2015)


(3)	The Aquifer Protection District includes the well head protection areas (WHPA’s) for active community water systems, delineated and maintained by the NH DES and shown on the Town of Plaistow’s Aquifer Protection District Map 2015. (Amended ATM 2015)
 

(4)	The Aquifer Protection District is a zoning overlay district that imposes additional requirements and restrictions to those of the underlying, base district. In all cases, the more restrictive requirement(s) shall apply. (Amended ATM 2015)


B.	Recharge areas. For the purpose of this article, the primary recharge area for the identified aquifer is considered to be co-terminus with that aquifer.

C.	Appeals. Where the bounds of the identified aquifer or recharge area, as delineated, are in doubt or in dispute, any landowner aggrieved by such delineation may appeal the boundary location to the Planning Board. Upon receipt of such appeal, the Planning Board shall suspend further action on development plans related to the area under appeal and shall engage, at the landowner's expense, a qualified hydrogeologist to prepare a report determining the proper location and extent of the aquifer and recharge area relative to the property in question. The aquifer delineation shall be modified by such determination subject to review at the expense of the applicant and approval by the Planning Board after review and recommendation by the Conservation Commission.

§ 220-133.  Use regulations.

A.	Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size within that portion of the Aquifer Protection District that has a saturated thickness of 20 feet or greater and a transmissivity greater than 1,000 feet squared per day shall be three acres, or 130,680 square feet, unless some other provision of this article requires it to be greater.

B.	Hydrogeologic study.

Particularly sensitive sites may include areas that have septic systems in close proximity to wells or may contain excessively drained soils or steep slopes.

(3)	Hydrogeologic studies shall be performed by a qualified hydrogeologist registered in the State of New Hampshire. This study shall be sufficiently detailed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Planning Board that the development will not engender adverse short- or long-term impacts to water quality and availability for approvable land uses on land drawing upon the same groundwater source; upon adjacent or nearby water wells; upon animal and plant habitat; and upon wetland ecosystems. All hydrogeologic studies shall include at least the following:
 

(a)	Soil borings (to evaluate soil stratigraphy) and multilevel monitoring wells (to evaluate groundwater flow directions).

(b)	Cumulative impact nitrogen loading analysis employing a saturation buildout model. The analysis shall include verification that the development will not cause the nitrate-nitrogen (NO3-N) concentration in groundwater beyond the site to exceed five milligrams per liter.

(c)	Permeability testing.

(d)	Water quality sampling analysis.

(e)	Water table contours and groundwater flow direction.

(f)	Water budget analysis for watershed in which development is located that accounts for natural and anthropogenic recharge and discharge and storage capacity.

§ 220-135. Design and operation guidelines.

Where applicable the following design and operation guidelines shall be observed within the Aquifer Protection District:

A.	Nitrate loading. In those portions of the Aquifer Protection District where the aquifer has a saturated thickness of 20 feet or greater and a transmissivity greater than 1,000 feet squared per day, no development shall cause the nitrate-nitrogen
 

(NO3-N) concentration to exceed five milligrams per liter in the groundwater beyond the site.

B.	Safeguards. Provision shall be made to protect against toxic or hazardous materials discharge or loss resulting from corrosion, accidental damage, spillage, or vandalism through measures such as spill control provisions in the vicinity of chemical or fuel delivery points; secured storage areas for toxic or hazardous materials; and indoor storage provisions for corrodible or dissolvable materials. For operations which allow the evaporation of toxic or hazardous materials into the interiors of any structures, a closed vapor recovery system shall be provided for each such structure to prevent discharge of contaminated condensate into the groundwater.

C.	Location. Where the premises are partially outside of the Aquifer Protection Overlay Zone, potential pollution sources such as on-site waste disposal systems shall be located outside the zone to the extent feasible.

D.	Drainage. All runoff from impervious surfaces shall be recharged on the site and diverted toward areas covered with vegetation for surface infiltration to the extent possible. Dry wells shall be used only where other methods are not feasible and shall be preceded by oil, grease, and sediment traps to facilitate removal of contaminants.

E.	Inspection. All conditional uses granted under § 220-133F of this article shall be subject to twice-annual inspections by the Building Inspector or other agent designated by the Selectmen. The purpose of these inspections is to ensure continued compliance with the conditions under which approvals were granted. A fee for inspection shall be charged to the owner according to a fee schedule determined by the Selectmen.

F.	Road standards shall ensure maximum local groundwater recharge occurs. [Added 9-12-2000]

G.	For uses that involve the storage of large volumes ( greater than 100 gallons) of regulated substances a Spill Prevention And Control Countermeasure (SPCC) Plan must be reviewed by a local emergency official (fire chief, health officer, or emergency management director).
